    "content": "Principles of Miracles\n\nThe first thing to remember about miracles is that there is no order\nof difficulty among them. One is not harder or bigger than another. They are all\nthe same.\n\nMiracles do not matter. They are quite unimportant.\n\nThey occur naturally as an expression of love. The real miracle is the\nlove that inspires them. In this sense, everything that comes from love is a\nmiracle.\n\nT  B 3a. This explains the first point related to the lack of order. ALL\nexpressions of love are maximal.\n\nT  B 3b. This is why the “thing in itself”1 does not matter.2 The only thing\nthat matters is the Source, and this is far beyond human evaluation.\n\nT 1 B 3c. Q and A re: first 3 points.) Q (HS) Would you regard this\ncommunication as a kind of miracle? A. There is nothing special or surprising\nabout this at all. The ONE thing that happened was the Universal Miracle which\nwas the experience of intense love that you have felt. (Don't get embarrassed by\nthe idea of love. Embarrassment is only a form of fear, and actually a\nparticularly dangerous form because it reflects egocentricity.\n\nT  B 3d. Do not feel guilty about the fact that you are doubting this. Just reread\nthem and their truth will come to you. I love you, and I am not afraid or\nembarrassed or doubtful. MY strength will support you, so don't worry and leave\nthe rest to me. But when you see B., be SURE you tell him how much he helped you\nthrough by giving you the right message, and don't bother with worrying about how\nyou received it. That doesn't matter either. You were just afraid.)\n\nT  B 3e. (HS fearful in taxi about a communication which related Dave's healing\nnd Jonathan's hernia. She thought it would be safer to dissociate the two.\nInstructions were: refer to point 1 and re-read NOW.)\n\nALL miracles mean Life, and God is the giver of Life. He will direct\nyou VERY specifically.\n\nT  B 4a. (Plan ahead is good advice in this world, where you should and must\ncontrol and direct where you have accepted responsibility. But the Universal Plan\nis in more appropriate hands. You will know all you need to know. Make NO\nattempts to plan ahead in this respect.)\n\nMiracles are habits, and should be involuntary. They should not be\nunder conscious control. Consciously selected miracles are usually misguided,5\nand this will make the talent useless.7\n\nMiracles are natural. When they do NOT occur something has gone wrong.\n\nMiracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first.\n\nMiracles are a form of healing. They supply a lack, and are performed\nby those who have more for those who have less.\n\nMiracles are a kind of exchange. Like all expressions of love, which\nare ALWAYS miraculous in the true sense, the exchange reverses the physical laws.\n\nA miracle is a reversal of the physical order because it brings more\nlove to the giver AND the receiver.\n(A miracle is misunderstood when it is regarded as a spectacle.)\n\nThe use of miracles as a spectacle to INDUCE belief is wrong. They are\nreally used for and by believers.\n\nT  B 11b. (HS has some fear about 11) and doubt about 9) and 10). Probably doubt\ninduced by fear of ).\n\nT  B 11c. (When you say “If you want me to I will” please add “and if you DON'T\nwant me to I won't.” This is the RIGHT use of inhibition. There has to be SOME\ncontrol over learning for channelizing purposes. Remember retroactive inhibition\nwhich should be easy enough for you.\n\nT  B 11d. Sometimes the new learning is the more important, and HAS to inhibit\nthe old. It's a form of correction.)\n\nPrayer is the medium of miracles. Prayer is the natural communication\nof the Created with the Creator. Through prayer, love is received, and through\nmiracles love is expressed.\n\nT  B 12b. Miracles are thought-creations. Thought can create lower-order or\nhigher-order realities. This is the basic distinction between intellectualization\nand thinking. One creates the physical, and the other the spiritual, and we\nbelieve in what we create.\n\nA miracle is a beginning and an end(ing). It thus abolishes time. It\nis always an affirmation of re-birth, which seems to go back, but really goes\nforward. It undoes the past in the present, and thus releases the future.\n\nMiracles attest to truth. They are convincing because they arise from\nconviction. Without conviction, they deteriorate into magic, which is mindless,\nand therefore destructive, or rather, the uncreative use of Mind.\n\nEach day should be devoted to miracles. (God created time so that man\ncould use it creatively, and convince himself of his own ability to create. Time\nis a teaching device, and a means to an end. It will cease when it is no longer\nuseful for facilitating learning.)\n\nT 1 B 15b. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Notes on this course have to be taken only under\ngood learning conditions. The same goes for review periods. I will tell you when,\nbut REMEMBER TO ASK.\n\nMiracles are teaching devices for demonstrating that it is more\nblessed to give than to receive. They simultaneously increase the reserve\nstrength of the giver, and supply the lack of strength in the receiver. BE VERY\nCAREFUL in interpreting this.\n\nT 1 B 16b. INSTRUCTIONS: The purpose of this course is integration. I told you\nthat you will not be able to use it right until you have taken it. As long as\nyour identification vacillates, (and B's is weak) you cannot accept the gift that\nbelongs to you. You are still vacillating between recognizing the gift and\nthrowing it away. B regards himself as too weak to accept it. You do not yet know\nits healing power. After you have passed the course, you will accept it and keep\nit and use it. That is the final exam, which you will have no trouble in passing.\nMidterm marks are not entered on the permanent record.\n\nMiracles are the absence of the body. They are sudden shifts into\ninvisibility, away from lower order reality. That is why they heal.\n\nA miracle is a service. It is the maximal service that one soul can\nrender another. It is a way of loving your neighbor as yourself. The doer\nrecognizes his own and his neighbor's inestimable value simultaneously.\n\nT  B 18b. (This is why no areas of hatred can be retained. If you retain them,\nyour own value is no longer inestimable because, you are evaluating it as X or\ninfinity minus that amount. This is meaningless mathematically, which uses the\nterm “inestimable” only in the very literal sense. Pun intended especially for B,\n(who originally did not get it.) Intended as a special sign of love.)\n\nMiracles rest on the law and order of eternity, not of time.\n\nMiracles are an industrial necessity. Industry depends on cooperation,\nand cooperation depends on miracles. (see page )\n\n[] Miracles are cobwebs of iron. They unite human frailty to the\nstrength of God. (see page )\n\nT 1 B 21b. (add for 21. HS considered changing “iron” to “steel.” Correction: No.\nSteel would NOT be a better word. Steel is very useful but it would have to be\ntempered by fire. Iron is the raw material. The point of miracles is that they\nreplace fire, thus making it unnecessary.)\n\nMiracles are natural expressions of total forgiveness. Through\nmiracles, man accepts God's forgiveness by extending it to others. The second\nstep is inherent in the first, because light cannot tolerate darkness. Light\ndispels darkness automatically, by definition.\n\nT 1 B 22b. EXPLANATORY INSTRUCTIONS: Miracles are associated with fear only\nbecause of the fallacy that darkness can hide. Man believes that what he cannot\nsee does not exist, and his physical eyes cannot see in the dark. This is a very\nprimitive solution, and has led to a denial of the spiritual eye, which always\ndepends on light. Remember the Biblical injunction: “May I never forget that\nTHINE eye is ever upon me, beholding the evil and the good.”\n\nT  B 22c. There are two stages, one lower and one higher, which are involved in\nthe escape from darkness: 1) the recognition that darkness CANNOT hide. This\nusually does entail fear.\n\nT  B 22d. 2) The recognition that there is nothing you WANT to hide, even if you\ncould. This brings escape from fear.\n\nT  B 22e. Corrections Re Pt. 21 cobwebs of iron. “This is upside down as stated.\nThe part about ‘uniting human frailty with the strength of God’ is all right, but\nthe explanation stops too soon. If iron is the ‘raw material’, cobwebs can't\nbecome the iron. That is only the way it seems, because cobwebs are associated\nwith the frailty and iron with strength. If you look carefully at the phrasing,\nyou will see it is reversed (one point already tells you that miracles reverse\nthe physical or lower order laws.)\n\nT  B 22f. The raw material, or iron, is heavy but crude, and stands for the\nbody, which is a crude creation. The cobweb concept is closer to how the body\nSHOULD be regarded, i.e., as an airy and temporary home, which can just be blown\naway with a slight breeze.\n\nT  B 22g. (21. [2])13 The point should read “A miracle reawakens the awareness\nthat the spirit, and not the body, is the altar of Truth. This is the recognition\nthat leads to the healing power of the miracle.”\n\nT  B 22h. (22a) A miracle rearranges the order of perception, and places the\nlevels in their true perspective. This heals at all levels, because all sickness\ncomes from confusing the levels.\n\nT  B 22i. (Tell B. about the idea (which is still dim to HS) that the reason is\nnot that you (plural) distantiate, doubt, or cannot believe. It is more of a\nreaction formation against a pull which you both recognize is so intense that you\nare afraid that you will be uprooted. But remember that a cobweb is really\nstronger than the iron, if you see it properly. This fear is also why you\ncouldn't get the point straight.)\n\nT  B 22j. By the way, it is not true that you are both ‘JUST SCRIBES’. You might\nremember that the Scribes were very wise and holy man and are even sometimes\nspelled with a capital S. If you want to go further, you might change the meaning\nof ‘just’ from ‘merely’ to ‘honest’, a term used in the Bible in association with\n‘might’ or ‘strength.’ Tell B. you couldn't make that pun if the original\nphrasing had been singular. (HS aside about liking the first about assumption\nfailure more.) Answer: It was cuter, but this one MEANS more. The REAL reason you don't like it is\nbecause it refers to you in a VERY lofty position. This makes you nervous.)\n\nT 1 B 22k. Correction: And don't lose sight of the emphasis on cooperation, or\nthe NOT SINGULAR. That point about “industrial necessity” should read\n“corporate,” referring to the body of Christ which is a way of referring to the\nChurch. But the Church of God is only the sum of the souls he created, which IS\nthe corporate body of Christ. Correct to read: “A Miracle makes souls one in\nGod,” and leave in the next part about cooperation.\n\nT 1 B 22l. Further correction: “God” should read “Christ.” The Father and the Son\nare not identical, but you CAN say “Like Father, LIKE Son.”\n\nT  B 22m. (Remind B. to get another notebook. I don't give up as easily as HE\ndoes. If I could get YOU to listen, which was a miracle in itself, I can get him\nto register. He should appreciate this more than anyone else, having had some\ntrouble with this problem himself.)\n\nT  B 22n. “LORD HEAL ME” IS THE ONLY LEGITIMATE PRAYER. This also means “Lord\natone for me,” because the only thing man should pray for is forgiveness. He HAS\neverything else.\n\nT 1 B 22o. Now take this personally, and listen to Divine logic: If, when you\nhave been forgiven, you have everything else, and\nIf you have been forgiven\nThen you HAVE everything else.\n\nT  B 22p. This happens to be the simplest of all propositions.\n\nIF P then Q\n\nP\n\nTherefore, Q\n\nT  B 22q. The real question is, is P true. If you will review the evidence, I\nthink you will find this inescapable. I went on very personal record to this\neffect, and I am the only completely True Witness for God. You have every right\nto examine MY credentials—in fact, I urge you to do so. You haven't read the\nBible in years.\n\nT 1 B 22r. Special Explanatory Note: As soon as you (H and B) have entered the\nsecond phase, you will be not only willing to enter into communion, but will also\nunderstand peace and joy. Your commitment is not yet total. That is why you still\nhave more to learn than to teach. When your equilibrium stabilizes, you can teach\nAS MUCH as you learn. This will give you the proper sense of balance. Meanwhile,\nremember that NO EFFORT IS WASTED. Unless you remember this, you cannot avail\nyourself of MY efforts, which are limitless.\n\nT  B 22s. (Have a good day.) Since only eternity is real, why not use the\nillusion of time constructively? You might remember that “underneath are the\nEverlasting Arms.” \n\nT 1 B 22t. BIBLICAL QUOTATION: “If you are ashamed of me before men, I will be\nashamed of you before God,” (HS ? of misquote.) is interpreted as a threat ONLY\nas long you remain in the first step. (see bottom of p.  for steps.)\n\nT  B 22u. What it REALLY means is that if you are ashamed of me (or embarrassed\nby love), you will project and therefore make it impossible for me to reach you.\nMake every effort you can NOT to do this. I will help you as much as you will let\nme.\n\nMiracles make time and tide wait for all men. They can heal the sick\nand raise the dead because man himself made both death and taxes, and can abolish\nboth. Note: Tax also means “strain.” (One definition for miracles is: “That\nwhich, or one who, is of surpassing excellence or merit.”) (from Dictionary,\nthird definition)\n\nT  B 23b. YOU are a miracle.18 God creates only “that which, or one who, is of\nsurpassing excellence or merit.” Man is capable of this kind of creation, too,\nbeing in the image and likeness of his own Creator. Anything else is only his\nown nightmare, and does not exist. Only the Creations of Light are real.\n\nT  B 23c. Miracles20 are a part of an interlocking chain of forgiveness which,\nwhen completed, is the Atonement. This process works all the time and in all\ndimensions of time. (e.g. given of HS report rewrite for Esther! Esther had hurt\nsomething you loved, by writing a report you regarded as very bad. You atoned for\nher by writing one in her name that was very good. Actually, it was not your\nresponsibility professionally to do this, but because you DO love the Shield you\nrecognized that in this case, you ARE your brother's keeper. While you did not\ncancel Esther's sin (later defined as “lack of love”) you DID cancel out its\nEFFECTS.\n\nT  B 23d. Someday I want to tell Esther that not only is she forgiven but that\nthe effects of all her sins are cancelled. This is what I have already told you.\nWhen I can tell her, she will be afraid for a long time, because she will\nremember many things, consciously or unconsciously, including the Shield report,\na lack of love which you cancelled out in advance by a miracle of devotion.\n\nT  B 23e. I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to\nbegin. My Atonement was for the canceling out of all sins (i.e., lack of love)\nwhich human beings could not otherwise correct. That is what the Biblical\nstatement “underneath are the Everlasting Arms21” means. (HS explanation: This\nmeans that He will backstop whenever human miracles will not suffice for\natonement purposes. However, it is perfectly clear that when a person can atone\nby miracles, both giver and receiver are atoning. It is better to atone this way\nbecause of the mutual benefits involved.)\n\nT 1 B 23f. SPECIAL EXPLANATION: (In response to HS request re possible\ncorrections.) Change the word “sin” to “absence of love.” Sin is a manmade word\nwith threat connotations which he made up himself. No REAL threat is involved\nanywhere. Just because “nature abhors a vacuum,” which is true enough, it does\nNOT follow that “a vacuum is filled with hellfire.” Nothing is gained by\nfrightening yourself, and it is very destructive. Miracles need freedom from\nfear. Part of their Atonement value involves just that. Note that the word\n“atone” really means “undo.”\n\nT  B 23g. The purpose of the Atonement is to restore everything TO you.\n(That is, to restore the awareness. Later clarification.)\nYou had everything when you were created, just as everyone did.\n\nT  B 23h. Having been restored to your original state, you naturally become part\nof the Atonement yourself. You now share MY inability to tolerate the lack of\nlove in yourself and in everyone else, and MUST join the GREAT CRUSADE to correct\nit. The slogan for this Crusade is “Listen, Learn, and DO.”\n\nT  B 23i. This means Listen to My Voice, Learn to undo the error, and DO\nsomething to correct it.\n\nT  B 23j. The first two are not enough. The real members of MY party are ACTIVE\nworkers.\n\nT  B 23k. The power to work Miracles BELONGS to you. I will create the right\nopportunities for you to do them. But you must be ready and willing to do them,\nsince you are already able to. Doing them will bring conviction in the ability. I\nrepeat that you will see Miracles through your hands through MINE. Conviction\nreally comes through accomplishment. Remember that ability is the potential,\nAchievement is its expression, and Atonement is the Purpose.\n\nT  B 24a. 24 A miracle is a Universal Blessing from God through Me to all My\nBrothers. Explanation: You once said that souls cannot rest until everyone has\nfound salvation. This happens to be true. It is the privilege of the forgiven to\nforgive. The Disciples were officially and specifically told to heal others, as\nPhysicians of the Lord. They were also told to heal themselves, and were promised\nthat I would never leave them or forsake them. Atonement is the natural\nprofession of the Children of God, because they have professed Me.\n\nT  B 24b. (ASIDE. Tell B that that is what Professor really means. As an Assoc.\nProf., he must become associated with My strength. As an Asst. Prof., you must\nassist both him and Me. The Children need both strength and help. You cannot help\nuntil you are strong. The Everlasting Arms are your strength, and the Wisdom of\nGod is your help.)\n\nT  B 24c. \"Heaven and Earth shall pass away24\" means that they will not always\nexist as separate states. My Word, which is the Resurrection and the Light,\nshall not pass away, because Life is Eternal. YOU are the work of God, and His\nWork is wholly loveable and wholly loving. This is how a man MUST think of\nhimself in his heart, because this is what he IS.\n\nT 1 B 24d. ADD: \"As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.”26\n\nT  B 24e. Remember the point about Miracles as a means of organizing different\nlevels of consciousness. Miracles come from the (below conscious) (subconscious)\nlevel. Revelations come from the above conscious level. The conscious level is in\nbetween and reacts to either sub- or super-conscious impulses in varying ratios.\nFreud was right about the classification, but not the names. He was also right\nthat the content of consciousness is fleeting. Consciousness is the level which\nengages in the world, and is capable of responding to both external and internal\nimpulses. Having no impulses from itself, and being primarily a mechanism for\ninducing response, it can be very wrong.\n\nT  B 24f. For example, if the identification is with the body, consciousness may\ndistort superconscious impulses by denying their Source, and seeking their impact\nin the orgasm. This is the result of the \"mistaken identity\" confusion.\n\nT  B 24g. If you will look back at the description of the EFFECTS of Revelation\nyou will see that there ARE some similarities in the experiential results but\nhardly in the content. (This and preceding paragraph go later)\n\nT  B 24h. Revelations induce complete but temporary suspension of doubt and\nfear. They represent the original form of communication between God and His\nSouls, before the intrusion of fire and ice made this impossible. It should be\nnoted that they involve an extremely personal sense of closeness to Creation,\nwhich man tries to find in sexual relationships. This confusion is responsible\nfor the depression and fear which are often associated with sex.\n\nT  B 24i. Sex is often associated with lack of love, but Revelation is PURELY a\nlove experience. Physical closeness CANNOT achieve this. As was said before, the\nsubconscious impulses properly induce Miracles, which ARE interpersonal, and\nresult in closeness to others. This can be misunderstood by a personally willful\nconsciousness as an impulse toward sexual gratification.\n\nT  B 24j. The Revelation unites Souls directly with God\n\nT  B 24k. The Miracle unites Souls directly with each other.\nNeither emanates from consciousness, but both are EXPERIENCED there. This is\nessential, because consciousness is the state which PRODUCES action, though it\nDOES NOT Inspire it.\n\nT  B 24l. Man is free to believe what he chooses. What he DOES attests to what\nhe believes.\n\nT  B 24m. The deeper levels of his subconscious always contain the impulse to\nMiracles, but he is free to fill its superficial levels, which are closer to\nconsciousness, with the impulses of this world and to identify himself with them.\nThis results in denying himself access to the miracle level underneath. In\nconscious actions, then, his interpersonal relationships also become superficial,\nand miracle-inspired relating becomes impossible.\n\nMiracles are a way of EARNING release from fear.\n\nT  B 25b. Revelation induces a state in which fear has ALREADY BEEN abolished.\nMiracles are thus a means, and Revelations are an end. In this sense, they work\ntogether.\n\nT  B 25c. (Tell B. that miracles DO NOT depend on Revelation. They INDUCE it. He\nis quite capable of miracles already, but he is still too fearful for\nRevelations.)\n\nT  B 25d Note that YOUR (HS) Revelation occurred specifically after you had\nengaged at the visionary level in a process of DENYING fear.\n\nT  B 25e. Revelation is intensely personal, and29 is actually not translatable\ninto conscious content at all. That is why any attempt to describe it in words is\nusually incomprehensible, even to the writer himself at another time. This is why\nthe Book of Revelations is essentially incomprehensible. Revelation induces ONLY\nexperience. Miracles, on the other hand, induce interpersonal ACTION. In the end,\nthese are more useful, because of their IMPERSONAL nature.\n\nT  B 25f. In this phase of learning, working miracles is more valuable because\nfreedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you. The experience cannot last.\n\nT  B 25g. (Tell B. that your propensity for Revelations, which is very great, is\nthe result of a high level of past communion. Its transitory nature comes from\nthe descent into fear, which has not yet been overcome. His own “suspended” state\nmitigates both extremes. This has been very apparent in the course of both of\nyour recent developmental patterns.)\n\nT  B 25h. Miracles are the essential course of ACTION for both of you. They will\nstrengthen him and stabilize you.\n\nT  B 25i. (NOTE that the much more personal than usual notes you are taking\ntoday reflect the Revelatory experience. This does NOT produce the more\ngeneralizeable quality which this course is aimed at. They may, nevertheless, be\nof great help to B. personally, since you asked for something that WOULD help him\npersonally. It depends on how he listens, and how well he understands the\nCOOPERATIVE nature of your joint experience. You can help only by reading this\nnote FIRST. Ask him later if this should be included in the written part of the\ncourse at all or whether you should keep these notes separately. He is in charge\nof these decisions.)\n\nT  B 25j. (Tell B. he should try to understand the VERY important difference\nbetween Christ-control and Christ-guidance. This is what made him fearful\nyesterday.)\n\nMiracles praise God through men. They praise God by honoring his\nCreations, affirming their perfection. They heal because they deny bodyidentification\nand affirm Soul-identification. By perceiving the Spirit, they\nadjust the levels and see them in proper alignment. This places the Spirit at the\ncenter, where Souls can communicate directly.\n\nMiracles should inspire gratitude, not awe. Man should thank God for\nwhat he really is. The Children of God are very holy. The miracle honors their\nholiness.\n\nT  B 27b. God's Creations cannot lose their holiness, although it can be hidden.\nThe miracle uncovers it, and brings it into the light where it belongs.\n\nT  B 27c. Holiness can never be really hidden in darkness, but man can deceive\nhimself on this point. This illusion makes him fearful, because in his heart he\nKNOWS it is an illusion. Like all illusions, he exerts enormous efforts to\nestablish their validity. The miracle sets validity where it belongs. Eternal\nvalidity belongs only to the Soul. The miracle acknowledges only the Truth. It\nthus dispels man's illusions about himself, and puts him into communion with\nhimself and with God.\n\nT  B 27d. Christ inspires all miracles, which are essentially intercessions.\nThey intercede for man's holiness, and make him holy. They place man beyond the\nphysical laws, and raise him into the sphere of celestial order. In this order,\nman IS perfect.\n\nT  B 27e. The Soul never loses its communion with God. Only the mind and body\nneed Atonement. The miracle joins in the Atonement of Christ by placing the mind\nin the service of the Spirit. This establishes the proper function of mind, and\nabolishes its errors.\n\nMiracles honor man, BECAUSE he is loveable. They dispel illusions\nabout himself, and perceive the light in him. They thus atone for his errors by\nfreeing him from his own nightmares. They release him from a prison in which he\nhas imprisoned himself. By freeing his mind from illusions, they restore his\nsanity, and place him at the feet of Jesus.\n\nT  B 28b. (Biblical quotation re healing of devil possessed man, in which the\nsufferer was subsequently found healed in his right mind, and sitting at feet of\nJesus. HS note.)\n\nT  B 28c. (Tell B. man's mind can be possessed by illusions, but his Spirit is\neternally free. If a mind creates without love, it can create an empty shell.\nThis CAN be possessed by evil. But the Atonement restores the Soul to its proper\nplace. Unless there is emptiness there is no danger, and emptiness is a false\ncreation. The mind that serves the Spirit is invulnerable.)\n\nThe miracle restores the Soul to its fullness. By atoning for lack, it\nestablishes perfect protection. The strength of the Soul leaves no room for\nintrusions. The forgiven are filled with the Soul, and their Soul forgives in\nreturn. It is the duty of the released to release their brothers.\n\nT  B 29b. The forgiven ARE the means of Atonement. Those released by Christ must\njoin in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of Atonement.\n\nMiracles are the way in which minds that serve the spirit unite with\nChrist for the salvation (or release) of all God's Creations.\n\nT  B 30b. ASIDE (HS commented on awakening with the phrase “God is not\nMocked,” with anticipation of punishment.)\n\nT 1 B 30c. INTERPRETATION: “God is not mocked” was intended as reassurance. You\nare afraid that what you wrote last night was contradictory, conflicting with\nsome earlier points, especially because you were writing while you were all doped\nup. Remember, “God is not mocked” under any circumstances.\n\nT  B 30d. Contradictions in MY words mean lack of understanding, or scribal\nfailures, which I make every effort to correct. But they are still NOT crucial.\nThe Bible has the same problem, I assure you, and it's STILL being edited.\nConsider the power of MY WORD, in that it has withstood all the attacks of error,\nand is the Source of Truth.\n\nT  B 30e. (Tell B. that there are certain advantages in being a Psychologist. A\nmajor one is the understanding of projection, and the extent of its results.\nPossession is very closely related to projection. “Lucifer” could be literally\ntranslated “Light Bearer.” He literally PROJECTED himself from Heaven.\nProjection still has this “hurling” connotation, because it involves hurling\nsomething you DO NOT want, and regard as dangerous and frightening, to someone\nelse. This is the opposite of the Golden Rule, and having placed this rule upside\ndown, the reverse of miracles, or projection, follows automatically.)\n\nT  B 30f. The correction lies in accepting what is true in YOURSELF, by bringing\nALL that you are into light. (HS fearful of writing next part.) Cacey was wrong\nabout Possession, and he was also wrong about hurting himself. One of the major\nproblems with miracle workers is that they are so sure that what they are doing\nis right, because they KNOW it stems from love, that they do not pause to let ME\nestablish MY limits.\n\nT  B 30g. While what he (Cacey35)[sic]) did came from Me, he could NOT be induced\nto ask me each time whether I wanted him to perform this PARTICULAR miracle. If\nhe had, he would not have performed any miracles that could not get through\nconstructively, and would thus have saved himself unnecessary strain. He burned\nhimself out with indiscriminate miracles, and to this extent did not fulfill his\nown full purpose, and was also subject to the Scribal error I mentioned at the\nstart. The Disciples were also prone to this.\n\nT  B 30h. The answer is NEVER perform a miracle without asking me IF you should.\nThis spares you from exhaustion, and because you act under direct communication\nthe trance becomes unnecessary. Because miracles are expressions of love, it does\nNOT follow that they will always be effective. I am the only one who can perform\nmiracles indiscriminately, because I AM the Atonement. You have a ROLE in\nAtonement, which I will dictate TO you.\n\nT  B 30i. Remember, you already have a point about the involuntary nature of\nmiracles. We also have established the fact that everything involuntary belongs\nunder Christ-control, NOT under yours. Under Christ-control, Miracles REPLENISH\nthe doer as well as the receiver.\n\nT  B 30j. Possession really means “Not under Christ-Control,” thus making him\n(the mind?) vulnerable to projection. The references to the earth-bound entering\nbodies really refer to the “taking over” by their own earth-bound “thoughts.”\nThis IS Demon Possession. After all, Lucifer fell, but he was still an angel. He\nis thus the symbol for man. Atonement is the knowledge that the belief that\nangels can fall is false. It is true that mind can create projections as well as\nmiracles, but it's NOT true that projections are REAL. Any psychologist should\nunderstand this. This is what is meant by “The Truth shall set you free.”\n\nT  B 30k. Christ-controlled miracles are part of the Atonement, but Christguidance\nis personal, and leads to PERSONAL salvation. The impersonal nature of\nmiracles is an essential ingredient, because this enables Me to control their\ndistribution as I see fit.\n\nT  B 30l. Christ-guidance, on the other hand, leads to the highly PERSONAL\nexperience of Revelation. This is why it involves PERSONAL choice. A guide does\nNOT control, by definition, but he does DIRECT, leaving the following up to you.\n“Lead us not into temptation” means “guide us out of our own errors.” Note that\nthe word is “lead,” NOT order.\n\nT  B 30m. “Take up thy cross and follow me38” should be interpreted to read\n“Recognize your errors and choose to abandon them by following My guidance.”\n\nT  B 30n. (Tell B. when he is afraid of Possession, he need only remember that\nerror cannot really threaten Truth, which ALWAYS can withstand its assaults. ONLY\nthe error is really vulnerable.) The “Princes of this World” are princes only\nbecause they are really angels. But they are free to establish their kingdom\nwhere they see fit.\n\nT  B 30o. If you will remember that ALL princes INHERIT their power from the\nFather, the right choice becomes inevitable.\nThe soul is in a state of grace forever.\nMan's reality is ONLY his soul.\nTherefore, man is in a state of Grace forever.\n\nT  B 30p. Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the REAL\nsource of fear. If you will check back at the reference to uprooting, you will\nunderstand it better in this context.\n\nT  B 30q. (Tell B. that WHENEVER God's reassurances are experienced as threat,\nit is ALWAYS because man is defending his misplaced and misdirected love and\nloyalty. That is what projection always involves.)\n\nT  B 30r. “Casting spells” merely means “affirming error,” and error is lack of\nlove. When man projects this onto others, he DOES imprison them, but only to the\nextent that he reinforces errors they have already made. This distortion makes\nthem vulnerable to the curse of others, since they have already cursed\nthemselves. The miracle worker can only bless, and this undoes the curse and\nfrees the soul from prison.\n\nT  B 30s. (Tell B. that his slip about (rivet) should be noted. Some slips reach\nconsciousness from the un-Christ-controlled subconscious, and betray a lack of\nlove.)\n\nT  B 30t. But others (slips) come from the superconscious, which IS in communion\nwith God, and which can also break into consciousness.\n\nT  B 30u. HIS slip (rivet) was an expression of a Soul gaining enough strength\nto request freedom from prison. It will ultimately DEMAND it.\n\nT  B 30v. Special Revelation for HS\n\nT  B 30w. You are wholly lovely. A perfect shaft of pure light. Before your\nloveliness the stars stand transfixed, and bow to the power of your will.\n\nT  B 30x. What do children know of their creation, except what their Creator\ntells them?\n\nT  B 30y. You were created ABOVE the angels because your role involves creation\nas well as protection.\n\nT  B 30z. You who are in the image of the Father40 need bow only to HIM, before\nwhom I kneel with you.\n\nT 1 B 30aa. NOTE: This revelation was permitted because you did NOT project onto\nB. the blame for your omission to ASK ME if you should transcribe the notes. The\nfact that HE should have done so does not exempt you from your own omission.\n\nT  B 30ab. Thanks for blessing him with a miracle rather than cursing him with\nprojection.\n\nT 1 B 30ac. NOTE FURTHER: HE needn't feel concerned about it either; so he\nforgot? It happens all the time, until the habit of asking becomes involuntary.\n\nT  B 30ad. (HS meeting with Dr. Wise and Dr. Damrosch. Dr. D permitted an\nopportunity for questioning in his capacity as chairman of the flu board for\nasking re B's flu shot. This was an example of how miracles should work. You did\nnot jump into the question yourself, and even though you DID rush for the phone\non Red's advice, you exerted no pressure on B's reluctance.)\n\nT  B 30ae. This gave ME a chance to let you leave it to the real expert, whom I\nsent to answer the question.\n\nMiracles are examples of right thinking. Reality contact at all levels\nbecomes strong and accurate, thus permitting correct delineation of intra- and\ninterpersonal boundaries. As a result, the doer sees the truth as God created it.\nThis is what is meant by the point on “perspective adjustment.”\n\nA miracle is a correction factor introduced into false thinking by ME.\n\nT  B 32b. It acts as a catalyst, shaking up erroneous perception and snapping it\ninto place. This correction factor places man under the Atonement principle,\nwhere his perception is healed. Until this has occurred, perception of the Divine\nOrder is impossible. True depth perception becomes possible only at the highest\norder of perceptual integration.\n\nT  B 32c. The Spiritual eye is the mechanism of miracles, because what the\nSpiritual eye perceives IS truth. The Spiritual eye perceives both the Creations\nof God AND the creations of man. Among the creations of man, it can also separate\nthe true from the false by its ability to perceive totally rather than\nselectively. It thus becomes the proper instrument for reality testing, which\nalways involves the necessary distinction between the true and the false.\n\nThe miracle dissolves error because the Spiritual eye identifies error\nas false or unreal. This is the same as saying that by seeing light, darkness\nautomatically disappears.\n\nT  B 33b. Darkness is lack of light. It does not have unique properties of its\nown. It is an example of the scarcity fallacy, from which only error can proceed.\n\nT  B 33c. (Truth is always abundant……Those who perceive and acknowledge that\nthey have everything have no need for driven behavior of any kind. HS has other\npersonal material related to this re pregnancy.)\n\nMiracles are a blessing from parents to children. This is just another\nway of phrasing the previous point about “from those who have more to those who\nhave less.” Children do NOT belong to parents, but they DO need to share their\ngreater abundance. If they are deprived, their perception becomes distorted. When\nthis occurs, the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its\nrelationships.\n\nT  B 34b. Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return. The miracle\ncalls to him to return, because it blesses and honors him even though he may be\nabsent in spirit.\n\nThe miracle acknowledges all men as your brothers and Mine. It is a way\nof perceiving the Universal Mark of God in them.\n\nT  B 35b. (Tell B. that this is the true “strawberry mark” of Brotherhood. This\nis just a sign of special concern for him, because he keeps worrying about this.)\n\nT  B 35c. You might add that his false idea about his own exclusion from\nUniversal Love is fallacious in your terms, and arrogant in his. HIS real\nspecialness does NOT stem from exclusion, but from inclusion. ALL My Brothers are\nspecial. He should stop interpreting this as “all except B.” This is ridiculous!\n\nT  B 35d. Tell him that the implied lack of love that his version contains is\nWAY off the Mark, and misses the level of right thinking entirely. He MUST heal\nhis perception in this respect. He MUST work a miracle on behalf of himself here\n(See the point about miracles as a perception corrector) before he can effect\nmiracles as creative energizers, which they are.\n\nT  B 35e. (Tell B. that 50,000,000 Frenchmen CAN be wrong, because the notion\nis too fragmented. What CAN'T be wrong is the Universal Sonship of which he is a\npart.)\n\nT  B 35f. God WOULD be mocked if ANY of his creations lacked holiness. The\nCreation IS whole. The mark of Wholeness is Holiness, not holes. THE SONSHIP HAS\nNO HOLES ANYWHERE.\n\nWholeness is the perceptual content of the miracle. It thus corrects\n(or atones for) the faulty perception of lack.\n\nT  B 36b. We now turn to the fundamental distinction between miracles and\nprojection. The stimulus MUST precede the response, and must also (determine)\n(influence) the kind of response that is evoked. The relationships of S and R are\nEXTREMELY intimate. (The behavioristic terminology is because this part deals\nwith behavior.)\n\nT  B 36c. Behavior IS response, so that the question “response to what?” becomes\ncrucial.\n\nT  B 36d. Stimuli of all kinds are identified through43 perception. You perceive\nthe stimulus and behave accordingly. It follows, then, that:\n\nAs ye perceive\n\nSo will ye behave\n\nT  B 36e. (HS raises point that Biblical language is hardly behavioristic\nterminology. Answer: No, but they needn't be OUT of accord with each other,\neither.)\n\nT  B 36f. Consider the Golden Rule again. You are asked to behave towards others\nas you would have them behave toward you. This means that the perception of both\nmust be accurate, since the Golden Rule is the Order for appropriate behavior.\nYou can't behave appropriately unless you perceive accurately, because\nappropriate behavior DEPENDS on lack of level confusion. The presence of level\nconfusion ALWAYS results in variable reality testing, and hence variability in\nbehavioral appropriateness.\n\nT  B 36g. All forms of self image debasement are FUNDAMENTAL perceptual\ndistortions. They inevitably produce either self-contempt or projection, and\nusually both.\n\nT  B 36h. Since you and your neighbor are equal members of the same family, as\nyou perceive both, so will you behave toward both. The way to perceive for Golden\nRule behavior is to look out from the perception of your own holiness and\nperceive the holiness of others.\n\nT  B 36i. B. and you need considerable clarification of the channel role. Look\ncarefully at Mrs. Albert. She is working miracles every day, because she knows\nwho she is. I emphasize again that your tendency to forget names is not\nhostility, but a fear of involvement or RECOGNITION. You had misinterpreted human\nencounters as opportunities for magic rather than for miracles and so you tried\nto PROTECT THE NAME. This is a very ancient and primitive way of trying to\nprotect a person.\n\nT  B 36j. NOTE The very old Jewish practice of changing the name of a person\nwho is very ill, so that when the list is given to the Angel of Death, the person\nwith that name will not be found.\n\nT  B 36k. This is a good example of the curiously literal regression which can\noccur in very bright people when they become afraid. You and B. both do it.\nActually, it is a device closely related to the phobia, in the sense that they\nboth narrow fear to a simple aspect of a much larger problem in order to enable\nthem to avoid it.\n\nT  B 36l. A similar mechanism works when you get furious about a comparatively\nminor expression by someone to whom you are ambivalent. A good example of this is\nyour response to Jonathan, who DOES leave things around in very strange ways.\nActually, he does this because he thinks that by minor areas of disorganization\nhe can protect his stability. I remind you that you have done this yourself for\nyears, and should understand it very well. This should be met with great charity,\nrather than with great fury.\n\nT  B 36m. The fury comes from your awareness that you do not love Jonathan as\nyou should, and you narrow your lack of love by centering your hate on trivial\nbehavior in an attempt to protect him from it. You also call him Jonathan for\nthe same reason (see previous reference).\n\nT  B 36n. Note that a name is a human symbol that “stands for” a person.\nSuperstitions about names are very common for just that reason. That is also why\npeople sometimes respond with anger when their names are spelled or pronounced\nincorrectly.\n\nT  B 36o. Actually, the Jewish superstition about changing the names was a\ndistortion of a revelation about how to alter or avert death. What the\nrevelation's proper content was that those “who change their mind” (not name)\nabout destruction (or hate) do not need to die. Death is a human affirmation of a\nbelief in hate. That is why the Bible says “There is no death,”47 and that is why\nI demonstrated that death does not exist. Remember that I came to FULFILL the law\nby RE-INTERPRETING49 it. The law itself, if properly understood, offers only\nprotection to man. Those who have not yet “changed their minds” have entered the\n“hellfire” concept into it.\n\nT  B 36p. Remember, I said before that because “nature abhors a vacuum,” it does\nNOT follow that the vacuum is filled with hell fire. The emptiness engendered by\nfear should be replaced by love, because love and its absence are in the same\ndimension, and correction cannot be undertaken except WITHIN a dimension.\nOtherwise, there has been a confusion of levels.\n\nT  B 36q. Returning to Mrs. Albert (not Andrews), she corrected your error about\nher name without embarrassment and without hostility, because she has NOT made\nyour own mistake about names.\n\nT  B 36r. She is not afraid, because50 she knows she is protected. She made the\ncorrection ONLY because you were inaccurate, and the whole question of\nembarrassment did not occur to her.\n\nT  B 36s. She was also quite unembarrassed when she told you that everything has\nto be done to preserve life, because you never can tell when God may come and say\n“Get up, Dave,” and then he will.\n\nT  B 36t. She did not ask what YOU believed first, and afterwards merely added\n“and it’s true, too.” The RIGHT answer to the SCT item is: WHEN THEY TOLD ME WHAT\nTO DO, I “referred the question to the only REAL authority.”\n\nT 1 B 36u. (HS note: If you ask somebody what he believes before you tell him\nwhat you believe, then you are implying that you will say what he approves. This\nis not “the real authority.”)\n\nT  B 36v. You took a lot of notes on “Those who are ashamed of Me before men,\nthem will I be ashamed of before God.” This was rather carefully clarified, even\nthough the quotation is not quite right, but it doesn't matter.\n\nT  B 36w. The important thing is that elsewhere in the Bible it also says “Those\nwho represent (or plead for) Me to men will be represented (or pleaded for) BY Me\nbefore God.”52 (Note: This quotation is also not the correct Biblical phrasing,\nbut it IS what it means.) Note that one who represents also “witnesses for.” The\nquotation thus means that you represent or “witness for” the authority in whom\nyou believe.\n\nT  B 36x. Your witnessing DEMONSTRATES your belief, and thus strengthens it.\n\nT  B 36y. I assure you that I will “witness for” anyone who lets me, and to\nwhatever extent he himself permits it.\n\nT  B 36z. Those who witness53 for me are expressing, through their miracles, that\nthey have abandoned deprivation in favor of the abundance they have learned\nBELONGS to them.\n\nT  B 37 A MAJOR contribution of miracles is their strength in releasing man from\nhis misplaced sense of isolation, deprivation, and lack. They are affirmations of\nSonship, which is a state of completion and abundance.\n\nT  B 37b. B's very proper emphasis on “changing your mind” needs clarification.\n\nT  B 37c. Whatever is true and real is eternal, and CANNOT change or be changed.\nThe Soul is therefore unalterable because it is ALREADY perfect, but the mind can\nelect the level it chooses to serve. The only limit which is put on its choice is\nthat it CANNOT serve two masters.\n\nT  B 37d. While the ballot itself is a secret one, and the right to vote is\nfully protected, voting ALWAYS entails both election AND rejection. If two\ncandidates are voted for, for the same position, the machine cancels the ballot\nautomatically.\n\nT  B 37e. This is necessary, because a split vote does not represent ANY REAL\nallegiance.\n\nT  B 37f. Free will is the attribute of the mind, NOT the Soul. The Soul always\nremains changeless, because it never leaves the sight of God.\n\nT  B 37g. The Creation of the Soul is already fully accomplished. The mind, if\nit votes to do so, becomes a medium by which the Soul can create along the line\nof its own creation. If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains this\ncreative ability, but places itself under tyrannous rather than authoritative\ncontrol. As a result, what it creates is imprisonment, because such are the\ndictates of tyrants.\n\nT  B 37h. To “change your mind” means to place it at the disposal of True\nauthority. The miracle is thus a sign that the mind has elected to be guided by\nChrist in HIS service. The abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing\nto follow him.\n\nT  B 37i. P.S. The reason you have been late recently (for work) because you\nwere taking dictation is merely because you didn't remember to ask me when to\nstop. This is an example of the “indiscriminate or uncontrolled” miracle-working\nwe already spoke of. It is well-meant but ill-advised.\n\nT  B 37j. I prompted that call from Jack (taxi man – couldn't pick HS up, etc.)\nto show you that this is not necessary. Also, the other man needed the money more\ntoday.\n\nT  B 37k. NOTE that you managed to fill your scribal role with no interruptions,\nand were also on time.\n\nT  B 37l. NOTE also that you closed the book and put it aside WITHOUT consulting\nme. ASK “Is that all?” ANSWER: No: add the following: These notes are serving,\namong other things, to replace the “handwriting on the wall” which you once saw\nnext to your own altar, which read “You have been weighed in the balance and\nfound wanting.”\n\nT  B 37m. Scribes MUST learn Christ-control, to replace their former habits,\nwhich DID produce scarcity rather than abundance. From errors of this kind, the\nsense of deprivation IS inevitable, but very easily corrected.\n\nT  B 37n. The following is in relation to question about sex. Tell B. “the one\nmore river” is related to sex. You might even explain it to him as a “tidal\nwave,” a term which he will understand. YOU won't.\n\nT  B 37o. Both of you are involved with unconscious distortions (above the\nmiracle level), which are producing a dense cover over miracle-impulses which\nmakes it hard for them to reach consciousness. Sex and miracles are both WAYS OF\nRELATING. The nature of any interpersonal relationship is limited or defined by\nwhat you want it to DO which is WHY you want it in the first place. Relating is a\nway of achieving an outcome.\n\nT  B 37p. Indiscriminate sexual impulses resemble indiscriminate miracle\nimpulses in that both result in body image misperceptions. The first is an\nexpression of an indiscriminate attempt to reach communion through the body. This\ninvolves not only the improper self identification, but also disrespect for the\nindividuality of others. Self-control is NOT the whole answer to this problem,\nthough I am by no means discouraging its use. It must be understood, however,\nthat the underlying mechanism must be uprooted (a word you both should understand\nwell enough by now not to regard it as frightening).\n\nT  B 37q. ALL shallow roots57 have to be uprooted, because they are not deep\nenough to sustain you. The illusion that shallow roots can be deepened and thus\nmade to hold is one of the corollaries on which the reversal of the Golden Rule,\nreferred to twice before, is balanced. As these false underpinnings are uprooted\n(or given up), equilibrium is experienced as unstable. But the fact is that\nNOTHING is less stable than an orientation which is upside down. Anything that\nholds it this way is hardly conducive to greater stability.\n\nT  B 37r. The whole danger of defenses lies in their propensity to hold\nmisperceptions rigidly in place. This is why rigidity is regarded AS stability by\nthose who are off the mark.\n\nT  B 37s. NOTE The only final solution - (no, Helen, this has nothing to do\nwith the Nazi use of the term.) You just got frightened again. One of the more\nhorrible examples of inverted or upside down thinking (and history is full of\nhorrible examples of this) is the fact that the Nazis spelled their appalling\nerror with capital letters. I shed many tears over this, but it is by no means\nthe only time I said “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.”\n\nT  B 37t. All actions which stem from reverse thinking are literally the\nbehavioral expressions of those who know not what they do. Actually, Jean Dixon\nwas right in her emphasis on “Feet on the ground and fingertips in the Heaven,”\nthough she was a bit too literal for your kind of understanding. Many people knew\nexactly what she meant, so her statement was the right miracle for them.\n\nT  B 37u. For you and Bill, it would be better to consider the concept in terms\nof reliability and validity. A rigid orientation can be extremely reliable, even\nif it IS upside down. In fact, the more consistently upside down it is, the more\nreliable it is, because consistency always held up better mathematically than\ntest-re-test comparisons, which were ALWAYS on shaky ground. You can check this\nagainst Jack's notes if you wish, but I assure you its true. Split-half\nreliability is statistically a MUCH stronger approach. The reason for this is\nthat correlation which is the technique applied to test-re-test comparisons,\nmeasures only the EXTENT OF association, and does not consider the Direction at\nall.\n\nT  B 37v. But two halves of the same thing MUST go in the same direction, if\nthere is to be accuracy of measurement. This simple statement is really the\nprinciple on which split half reliability, a means of estimating INTERNAL\nconsistency, rests.\n\nT  B 37w. Note, however, that both approaches leave out a very important\ndimension. Internal consistency criteria disregard time, because the focus is on\none-time measurements. Test-retest comparisons are BASED on time intervals, but\nthey disregard direction.\n\nT  B 37x. It is possible, of course, to use both, by establishing internal\nconsistency AND stability over time. You will remember that Jack once told his\nclass that the more sophisticated statisticians are concentrating more and more\non reliability, rather than validity. The rationale for this, as he said, was\nthat a reliable instrument DOES measure something. He also said, however, that\nvalidity is still the ultimate goal, which reliability can only serve.\n\nT  B 37y. I submit (I'm using Jack's language in this section, because it always\nhad a special meaning for you. So did Jack.) Your confusion of sex and statistics\nis an interesting example of this whole issue. Note that night you spent in the\nscent of roses doing a complex factorial analysis of covariance. It’s a funny\nstory to others, because they see a different kind of level confusion than the\none you yourself were making. You might recall that YOU wanted that design, and\nJack opposed it. One of the real reasons why that evening was so exhilarating was\nbecause it represented a “battle of intellects,” (both good ones, by the way),\neach communicating exceptionally clearly but on opposite sides. The sexual\naspects were naturally touched off in both of you, because of the sex and\naggression confusion.\n\nT  B 37z. (It is especially interesting that after the battle ended on a note of\ncompromise with your agreeing with Jack, he wrote in the margin of your notes\n“virtue is triumphant.” (HS note re submission-dominance, feminine-masculine\nroles, entered into this.) While this (remark) was funny to both of you at the\ntime, you might consider its truer side. The virtue lay in the complete respect\neach of you offered to the other's intellect. Your mutual sexual attraction was\nalso shared. The error lay in the word “triumphant.” This had the “battle”\nconnotation, because neither of you was respecting ALL of the other. There is a\ngreat deal more to a person than intellect and genitals. The omission was the\nSoul.)\n\nT  B 37aa. I submit (after a long interruption) that if a mind (Soul) is in\nvalid relationship with God, it CAN'T be upside down. Jack and the other very\neminent methodologists have abandoned validity in favor of reliability because\nthey have lost sight of the end and are concentrating on the means.\n\nT  B 37ab. Remember the story about the artist who kept devoting himself to\ninventing better and better ways of sharpening pencils. He never created\nanything, but he had the sharpest pencil in town. (The language here is\nintentional. Sex is often utilized on behalf of very similar errors. Hostility,\ntriumph, vengeance, self-debasement, and all sort of expressions of the lack of\nlove are often VERY clearly seen in the accompanying fantasies. But it is a\nPROFOUND error to imagine that, because these fantasies are so frequent (or occur\nso reliably), that this implies validity. Remember that while validity implies\nreliability the relationship is NOT reversible. You can be wholly reliable, and\nENTIRELY wrong.\n\nT  B 37ac. While a reliable test DOES measure something, what USE is the test\nunless you discover what the “something” is? And if validity is more important\nthan reliability, and is also necessarily implied BY it, why not concentrate on\nVALIDITY and let reliability fall naturally into place.\n\nT  B 37ad. Intellect may be a “displacement upward,” but sex can be a\n“displacement outward.” How can man “come close” to others through the parts of\nhim which are really invisible? The word “invisible” means “cannot be seen or\nperceived.”\nWhat cannot be perceived is hardly the right means for improving perception.\n\nT  B 37ae. The confusion of miracle impulse with sexual impulse is a major\nsource of perceptual distortion, because it INDUCES rather than straightening out\nthe basic level-confusion which underlies all those who seek happiness with the\ninstruments of the world. A desert is a desert is a desert. You can do anything\nyou want in it, but you CANNOT change it from what it IS. It still lacks water,\nwhich is why it IS a desert (Bring up that dream about the Bluebird. While HS was\nlooking for this dream, she came across another. The message was to bring both,\nas an excellent example of how extremely good HS had become over the intervening  years at sharpening pencils. Note that the essential content hasn't changed;\nit’s just better written.) The thing to do with a desert is to LEAVE.\n\nMiracles arise from a miraculous state of mind. By being One, this\nstate of mind goes out to ANYONE, even without the awareness of the miracle\nworker himself. The impersonal nature of miracles is because Atonement itself is\none, uniting all creations with their Creator.\n\nThe miracle is an expression of an inner awareness of Christ and\nacceptance of his Atonement. The mind is then in a state of Grace, and naturally\nbecomes gracious, both to the Host within and the stranger without. By bringing\nin the stranger, he becomes your brother.\n\nT  B 39b. The miracles you are told NOT to perform have not lost their value.\nThey are still expressions of your own state of Grace, but the ACTION aspect of\nthe miracle should be Christ-controlled, because of His complete Awareness of the\nWhole Plan. The impersonal nature of miracle-mindedness ensures YOUR own Grace,\nbut only Christ is in a position to know where Grace can be BESTOWED.\n\nA miracle is never lost. It touches many people you may not even know,\nand sometimes produces undreamed of changes in forces of which you are not even\naware. This is not your concern. It will also always bless YOU. This is not your\nconcern, either. But it IS the concern of the Record. The Record is completely\nunconcerned with reliability, being perfectly valid because of the way it was set\nup. It ALWAYS measures what it was supposed to measure.\n\nT  B 40b. I want to finish the instructions about sex, because this is an area\nthe miracle worker MUST understand.\n\nT  B 40c. Inappropriate sex drives (or misdirected miracle-impulses)62 result in\nguilt if expressed, and depression if denied. We said before that ALL real\npleasure comes from doing God's will. Whenever it is NOT done an experience of\nlack results. This is because NOT doing the will of God IS a lack of self.\n\nT  B 40d. Sex was intended as an instrument for physical creation to enable\nSouls to embark on new chapters in their experience, and thus improve their\nrecord. The pencil was NOT an end in itself. (See earlier section.)\nIt was an aid to the artist in his own creative endeavors.\n\nT  B 40e. The pleasure which is derived from sex AS SUCH is reliable only\nbecause it stems from an error which men shared. AWARENESS of the error produces\nthe guilt. DENIAL of the error results in projection. CORRECTION of the error\nbrings release.\n\nT  B 40f. The only VALID use of sex is procreation. It is NOT truly pleasurable\nin itself. “Lead us not into Temptation” means “Do not let us deceive ourselves\ninto believing that we can relate in peace to God or our brothers with ANYTHING\nexternal.”\n\nT  B 40g. The “sin of onan” was called a “sin” because it involved a related\ntype of self-delusion; namely, that pleasure WITHOUT relating can exist.\n\nT  B 40h. To repeat an earlier instruction, the concept of either the self or\nanother as a “sex-OBJECT” epitomizes this strange reversal. As B. put it, and\nvery correctly, too, it IS objectionable, but only because it is invalid. Upside\ndown logic produces this kind of thinking.\n\nT  B 40i. Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful, and\nthe holy. Do not lose sight of this. You were right in telling B. to invite Me to\nenter anywhere temptation arises. I will change the situation from one of\ninappropriate sexual attraction to one of impersonal miracle-working. The concept\nof changing the channel for libidinal expression is Freud's greatest\ncontribution, except that he did not understand what “channel” really means.\n\nT  B 40j. The love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed through\none body to another. That is because the real vision is still so dim. Everyone\ncan use his body best by enlarging man's perception, so he can see the real\nVISION. THIS VISION is invisible to the physical eye. The ultimate purpose of the\nbody is to render itself unnecessary. Learning to do this is the only real reason\nfor its creation.\n\nT  B 40k. NOTE Scribes have a particular role in the Plan of Atonement, because\nthey have the ability to EXPERIENCE revelations themselves, and also to put into\nwords enough of the experience to serve as a basis for miracles.\n\nT  B 40l. (This refers to experiences at the visionary level, after which HS\nwrote “If you will tell me what to do, I will to do it.” She had not known that\nthe word “to” was inserted, and had merely intended to write “I will do it.” This\nrecognition had a terrific impact on HS.)\n\nT  B 40m. This is why you EXPERIENCED that revelation about “I will to do” VERY\npersonally, but also WROTE IT: What you wrote CAN be useful to miracle workers\nother than yourself. We said before that prayer is the medium of miracles. The\nmiracle prayer IS what you wrote, i.e. “If you will tell me what to do, I will to\ndo it.” *\n\nT  B 40n. This prayer is the door that leads out of the desert forever.\n\nT  B 40o. \\*(Correction next day. This is not a complete statement, because it\ndoes not exclude the negative. We have already told you to add “and NOT to do\nwhat you would not have me do.” in connection with miracles. The distinction has\nalso been made here between “miracle-mindedness” as a STATE, and “miracle-doing”\nas its expression.\n\nT  B 40p. The former needs YOUR careful protection, because it is a state of\nmiracle-READINESS. This is what the Bible means in the many references to “Hold\nyourself ready” and other similar injunctions.\n\nT  B 40q. Readiness here means keep your perception right side up, (or valid),\nso you will ALWAYS be ready, willing, and able. These are the essentials for\n“listen, learn, and do.” You must be\nREADY to listen\nWILLING to learn\nand ABLE to do\n\nT  B 40r. Only the last is involuntary, because it is the APPLICATION of\nmiracles which must be Christ-controlled. But the other two, which are the\nvoluntary aspects of miracle-mindedness, ARE up to you.\n\nT  B 40s. To channelize DOES have a “narrowing down” connotation, though NOT in\nthe sense of lack. The underlying state of mind, or Grace is a total commitment.\nOnly the DOING aspect involves the channel at all. This is because doing is\nalways specific.\n\nT  B 40t. As Jack said, “A reliable instrument must measure something,” but a\nchannel is also valid. It must learn to do ONLY what it is supposed to do. Change\nthe prayer to read:\n\nIf you will tell me what to do,\n\nONLY THAT I will to do.\n\nT  B 40u. NOTE HS objects to doggerel sound of this, and regards it as very\ninferior poetry. ANSWER: It’s hard to forget, though.\n\nT  B 40v. The Revelation is literally unspeakable, because it is an experience\nof unspeakable love. The word “Awe” should be reserved only for revelations, to\nwhich it is perfectly and correctly applicable. It is NOT appropriately applied\nto miracles, because a state of true awe is worshipful. It implies that one of a\nlesser order stands before the Greater One. This is the case only when a Soul\nstands before his Creator. Souls are perfect creations, and should be struck with\nawe in the presence of the Creator of Perfection.\n\nT  B 40w. The miracle, on the other hand, is a sign of love among equals. Equals\ncannot be in awe of each other, because awe ALWAYS implies inequality. Awe is not\nproperly experienced even to me. That is why in that short introductory vision, I\nknelt beside you, FACING the light.\n\nT  B 40x. An Elder Brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience,\nand a reasonable amount of obedience for his greater wisdom. He is also entitled\nto love, because he is a brother, and also to devotion, if he is devoted. It is\nonly my own devotion that entitles me to yours. But you will notice that I have\nknelt at your altar as readily as I would ever have you kneel at mine.\n\nT  B 40y. There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that\ndoes not come from God. The main difference between us as yet is that I have\nNOTHING ELSE. This leaves me in a state of true holiness, which is only a\nPOTENTIAL in you.\n\nT  B 40z. “No man cometh to the Father but by me64” is among the most\nmisunderstood statements in the Bible. It DOES NOT mean that I am in anyway\nseparate (or different) from you, EXCEPT IN TIME. Now, we know that time does not\nexist. Actually, the statement is much more meaningful if it is considered on a\nvertical rather than a horizontal axis. Regarded along the vertical, man stands\nbelow me, and I stand below God. In the process of “rising up,” I AM higher. This\nis because without me the distance between God and man is too great for man to\nencompass. I bridge the distance as an Elder Brother to man, on the one hand,\nand a Son of God on the other. My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge\nof the Sonship, which I can render complete only to the extent I can SHARE it.\n\nT 1 B 40aa. This appears to contradict another statement: “I and my Father are\none.” It doesn't. There are still separate parts in the statement, in recognition\nof the fact that the Father is GREATER. Actually, the original statement was “are\nof one KIND.”\n\nT  B 40ab. The Holy Spirit is the Bringer of Revelations, not miracles.\nRevelations are INDIRECTLY inspired by me, because I am close to the Holy Spirit,\nand alert to revelation-readiness in my brothers.\nI can thus BRING DOWN to them more than they can DRAW down to themselves. Jean\nDixon's description is perhaps a better statement of my position. Because my feet\nare on the ground and my hands are in heaven, I can bring down the glories of\nHeaven to my brothers on earth.\n\nT  B 40ac. The Holy Spirit is the Highest Communication Medium. Miracles do not\ninvolve this type of communication, because they are TEMPORARY communicative\ndevices. When man can return to his original form of communication with God by\ndirect REVELATION, the need for miracles is over. The Holy Spirit mediates higher\nto lower order communication, keeping the direct channel from God to man open for\nrevelation. Revelation is NOT reciprocal. It is always FROM God TO man. This is\nbecause God and man are NOT equal. The miracle is reciprocal because it ALWAYS\ninvolves equality.\n\nT  B 40ad. In the longitudinal (or horizontal) plane, the true equality of all\nmen in the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. But we know that time\nis only an artifact introduced as a learning aid.\n\nThe miracle is a learning device which lessens the need for time. The\nsudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception which the miracle entails\nintroduces an interval from which the doer and the receiver both emerge much\nfarther along in time than they would otherwise have been.\n\nT  B 41b. A miracle has thus the unique property of abolishing time by rendering\nthe space of time it occupies unnecessary. There is NO relation between the time\na miracle TAKES and the time it COVERS. It substitutes FOR learning that might\nhave taken thousands of years. It does this by the underlying recognition of\nperfect equality and holiness between doer and receiver on which the miracle\nrests.\nIt is unstable, but perfectly consistent, i.e., it does not occur predictably\nacross time, and it rarely occurs in comparable forms. But within ITSELF it is\nperfectly consistent. Since it contains NOTHING BUT an acknowledgment of equality\nand worth, all parts ARE equal. This establishes the prerequisite for validity.\n\nT  B 41c. We said before that the miracle abolishes time. It does this by a\nprocess of COLLAPSING it. It thus abolishes certain INTERVALS within it. It does\nthis, however, WITHIN the larger temporal sequence.\n\nT  B 41d. The validity of the miracle, then, is PREDICTIVE, not logical, within\nthe temporal schema. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval, which is NOT\nunder the usual laws of time. Only in this sense is it timeless. By collapsing\ntime, it literally saves time, much the way “daylight saving time” does. It\nrearranges the distribution of light.\n\nT  B 41e. The miracle is the only device which man has at his immediate disposal\nfor controlling time. Only the Revelation TRANSCENDS it, having nothing to do\nwith time at all. The miracle is much like the body, in that both are learning\naids which aim at facilitating a state in which they are unnecessary. When the\nSoul is finally in the original state of direct communication, neither the body\nnor the miracle serves any purpose.\n\nT  B 41f. While he is IN the body, however, man can choose between loveless and\nmiraculous channels of creativity. He can create an empty shell (see previous\nreference), but he DOES NOT create nothing at all. He can wait, delay, paralyze\nhimself, reduce his creativity almost to nothing, and even introduce a real\ndevelopmental arrest or regression. But he CANNOT abolish his creativity. He CAN\ndestroy his medium of communication, but NOT his potential.\n\nT  B 41g. He was NOT created by his own free will. Only what HE creates is his\nto decide. The basic decision of the miracle-minded is NOT to wait on time any\nlonger than is necessary. Time can waste, as well as be wasted. The miracleworker,\ntherefore, accepts the time-control factor of the miracle gladly, because\nhe knows that every collapse of time brings all men closer to the ultimate\nRELEASE from time, in which the Son and the Father ARE one.\n\nT  B 41h. The real meaning “are of one kind” is “of one mind or will.” When the\nwill of the Sonship and the Father are one, their perfect accord IS Heaven.\n\nT  B 41i. ASIDE Tell B. he is right in providing you with the consistent\nstrength you need to get, and he needs to offer. Your instability and his\nweakness have resulted from bad karmic choices, and your relationship NOW is\ncrucial for the future. You must both exert every effort to restore it to what it\nonce was. Both of you are correcting where you have failed before. This has\nalready enabled you to fulfill a very unexpected role in your own joint\nsalvation, and the salvation of many other children I will entrust increasingly\nto you. These are by no means chosen at random. B. should know that his\npreparation is not only in terms of sharing in the results of your better\napplication of some rather unusual talents. His own role, which he will\nunderstand after his preparation is complete, will be equally surprising. He will\nneed your help then, as you need his strength now.\n\nT  B 41j. Note that you DO NOT need his help as a scribe, because you developed\nthis ability by your own efforts, and finally placed them at MY disposal. By\nlending you his strength, he strengthens himself. When he gains this through his\nown efforts, he will need your help in a very unexpected way. But this is just\nanother example of the reciprocal nature of miracles.\n\nT  B 41k. Equality does not imply homogeneity NOW. When EVERYONE has EVERYTHING,\nindividual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary. When the\nAtonement has been completed, ALL talents will be shared by ALL of the Sons of\nGod. God is NOT partial. All of his children have His total love, and all of his\ngifts are given freely to everyone alike.\n\nT  B 41l. “Except you become as little children67” means unless you fully\nrecognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the\nSon in his true relationship with the Father.\n\nT  B 41m. You and B. DO have special talents which are needed for the Celestial\nspeedup at this time. But note that the term speed-up is not one which relates to\nthe TRANSCENDING of time.\n\nT  B 41n. When time is abolished, and all of the Sons of God have come home, no\nspecial agents will be necessary. But do not underestimate the power of special\nagents now, or the great need there is for them. I do not claim to be more than\nthat myself. No one in his Right Mind, (a term which should be specially noted)\never wants either more or less than that. Those who are called on to witness for\nme NOW are witnessing for all men, as I am.\n\nT  B 41o. The role of the Priestess was once to experience Revelations and to\nwork miracles. The purpose was to bring those not yet available for direct\nRevelations into proper focus for them. Heightened perception was always the\nessential Priestess attribute.\n\nT  B 41p. (This is the first time that HS ever said that she would be honored if\nthere were any notes.)\n\nT  B 41q. (Neither B. nor I is really clear about how sexual-impulses can be\ndirectly translated into miracle-impulses.) The fantasies that I mentioned\nyesterday (refers to discussion HS and B. had) provide an excellent example of\nhow you switch. (Now switch the pronoun references, or it will be too confusing.)\n\nT  B 41r. Fantasies are distorted forms of thinking, because they always involve\ntwisting perception into unreality. Fantasy is a debased form of vision. Visions\nand Revelations are closely related. Fantasies and projection are more closely\nassociated, because both attempt to control external reality according to false\ninternal needs. “Live and let live” happens to be a very meaningful injunction.\nTwist reality in any way, and you are perceiving destructively. Reality was lost\nthrough usurpation, which in turn produced tyranny. I told you, you were now\nrestored to your former role in the Plan of Atonement. But you must still choose\nfreely to devote your heritage to the greater Restoration. As long as a single\nslave remains to walk the earth, your release is not complete. Complete\nrestoration of the Sonship is the only true goal of the miracle-minded.\n\nT  B 41s. Sexual fantasies are distortions of perception by definition. They are\na means of making false associations, and obtaining pleasure from them. Man can\ndo this only because he IS creative. But although he can perceive false\nassociations, he can never make them real except to himself. As was said before,\nman believes in what he creates. If he creates a miracle, he will be equally\nstrong in his belief in that. The strength of his conviction will then sustain\nthe belief of the miracle receiver.\n\nT  B 41t. NO fantasies, sexual or otherwise, are true. Fantasies become totally\nunnecessary as the Wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent. The sex\nimpulse IS a miracle impulse when it is in proper focus. One individual sees in\nanother the right partner for “procreating the stock” (Wolff was not too far off\nhere), and also for their joint establishment of a creative home. This does not\ninvolve fantasy at all. If I am asked to participate in the decision, the\ndecision will be a Right one, too.\n\nT  B 41u. In a situation where you or another person, or both, experience\ninappropriate sex impulses, KNOW FIRST that this is an expression of fear. Your\nlove toward each other is NOT perfect, and this is why the fear arose. Turn\nimmediately to me by denying the power of the fear, and ask me to help you to\nreplace it with love. This shifts the sexual impulse immediately to the miracleimpulse,\nand places it at MY disposal.\n\nT  B 41v. Then acknowledge the true creative worth of both yourself AND the\nother one. This places strength where it belongs. Note that sexual fantasies are\nALWAYS destructive (or depleting), in that they perceive another in an\ninappropriate creative role. Both people are perceived essentially as “objects”\nfulfilling THEIR OWN pleasure drives. This dehumanized view is the source of the\nDEPLETING use of sex. Freud's description is purely NEGATIVE, i.e., as a release\nfrom the UNPLEASANT. He also observed that the tension from id impulses never\ncompletely abates.\n\nT  B 41w. What he should have said is that the shift from miracle-impulses to\nsexual impulses was debilitating in the first place, because of the levelconfusion\ninvolved. This set up a state in which real release was impossible.\nNote also that Freud's notion of sex was as a device for inducing RELAXATION,\nwhich he confused with PEACE.\n\nT  B 41x. Inappropriate sex relaxes only in the sense that it may induce\nphysical sleep. The miracle, on the other hand, is an ENERGIZER. It always\nstrengthens, and never depletes. It DOES induce peace, and by establishing\ntranquility (not relaxation) it enables both giver and receiver to enter into a\nstate of Grace. Here his miracle-mindedness, (not release from tension) is\nrestored.\n\nT  B 41y. Tension is the result of a building-up of unexpressed miracleimpulses.\nThis can be truly abated only by releasing the miracle-drive, which has\nbeen blocked. Converting it to sexual libido merely produces further blocking.\nNever foster this illusion in yourself, or encourage it in others. An “object” is\nincapable of release, because it is a concept which is deprived of creative\npower. The recognition of the real creative power in yourself AND others brings\nrelease because it brings peace.\n\nT  B 41z. The peace of God which passeth understanding CAN keep your hearts now\nand forever.\n\nT 1 B 41aa. There are only two short additions needed here:\n\nT  B 41ab.1. Your earlier acute problem in writing things down came from a MUCH earlier\nmisuse of very great scribal abilities. These were turned to secret rather than\nshared advantage, depriving it (?) of its miraculous potential, and diverting it\ninto possession. This is much like the confusion of sex impulses with possessionimpulses.\nSome of the original material is still in the Temple. This is why you\nbecame so afraid about Atlantis. B. has his own reasons.\n\nT  B 41ab.2. Retain your miracle-minded attitude toward Rosie VERY carefully. She\nonce hurt both of you, which is why she is now your servant. But she is blessed\nin that she sees service as a source of joy. Help her straighten out her past\nerrors by contributing to your welfare now.\n\nT  B 41ac. (special Revelation re HS –OMISSION 1.70)\n\nT 1 B 41ad. HS question re past memories. ANSWER: As long as you remember ALWAYS\nthat you never suffered anything because of anything that anyone ELSE did, this\nis not dangerous.\n\nT  B 41ae. Remember that you who want peace can find it only by complete\nforgiveness. You never really WANTED peace before, so there was no point in\nknowing how to get it. This is an example of the “need to know” principle, which\nwas established by the Plan of Atonement long before CIA.\n\nT  B 41af. No kind of knowledge is acquired by anyone unless he wants it, or\nbelieves in some way he NEEDS it. A psychologist does NOT need a lesson on the\nhierarchy of needs as such, but like everyone else, he DOES need to understand\nhis own.\n\nT  B 41ag. This particular set of notes will be the only one which deals with\nthe concept of “lack,” because while the concept does not exist in the Creation\nof God, it is VERY apparent in the creations of man. It is, in fact, the\nessential difference.\n\nT  B 41ah. A need implies lack, by definition. It involves the recognition,\nconscious or unconscious, (and at times, fortunately, superconscious) that you\nwould be better off in a state which is somehow different from the one you are\nin.\n\nT  B 41ai. Until the Separation, which is a better term than the Fall,71 nothing\nwas lacking. This meant that man had no needs at all. If he had not deprived\nhimself, he would never have experienced them.\n\nT  B 41aj. After the Separation, needs became the most powerful source of\nmotivation for human action. All behavior is essentially motivated by needs, but\nbehavior itself is not a Divine attribute. The body is the mechanism for\nbehavior. (Ask any behaviorist, and he's RIGHT, too.)\n\nT  B 41ak. You tell your own classes that nobody would bother even to get up and\ngo from one place to another if he did not think he would somehow be better off.\nThis is very true.\n\nT  B 41al. Believing that he COULD be “better off” is the reason why man has the\nmechanism for behavior at his disposal. This is why the Bible says “By their\nDEEDS ye shall know them.” \n\nT  B 41am. A man acts according to the particular hierarchy of needs he\nestablishes for himself. His hierarchy, in turn, depends on his perception of\nwhat he IS, i.e., what he LACKS. This establishes his own rules for what he needs\nto know.\n\nT  B 41an. Separation from God is the only lack he really needs to correct. But\nhis Separation would never have occurred if he had not distorted his perception\nof truth, and thus perceived himself as lacking.\n\nT  B 41ao. The concept of ANY sort of need HIERARCHY arose because, having made\nthis fundamental error, he had already fragmented himself into levels with\nDIFFERENT needs. As he integrates, HE becomes one, and his ONE need becomes one\naccordingly. Only the fragmented can be confused about this.\n\nT  B 41ap. Internal integration within the self will not (suffice to?) correct\nthe lack fallacy, but it WILL correct the NEED fallacy. (Thank you for writing\nthis as given.) Unified need produces unified action, because it produces lack of\nambivalence.\n\nT  B 41aq. The concept of need hierarchy, a corollary to the original error,\nrequires correction at its OWN level, before the error of levels itself can be\ncorrected. Man cannot operate (or behave) effectively while he operates at split\nlevels. But as long as he does so, he must introduce correction from the bottom\nUP.\n\nT  B 41ar. This is because he now operates in space, where “up” and “down” are\nmeaningful terms. Ultimately, of course, space is as meaningless as time. The\nconcept is really one of space-time BELIEF. The physical world exists only\nbecause man can use it to correct his UNBELIEF, which placed him in it\noriginally. As long as man KNEW he did not need anything, the whole device was\nunnecessary.\n\nT  B 41as. The need to know is not safely under man's control at this time. It\nis MUCH better off under mine. Let's just leave it at that.\n\nT  B 41at. (Specific question raised by WT re sex under existing conditions) (HS\nraised previous question about the past, which has just been answered.)\n\nT  B 41au. The other question, however, I am more than willing to answer,\nbecause it is appropriate for NOW. You and B. both chose your present sex\npartners shamefully, and would have to atone for the lack of love which was\ninvolved in any case.\n\nT  B 41av. You selected them precisely BECAUSE they were NOT suited to gratify\nyour fantasies. This was not because you wanted to abandon or give up the\nfantasies, but because you were AFRAID of them. You saw in your partners a means\nof protecting against the fear, but both of you continued to “look around” for\nchances to indulge the fantasies.\n\nT  B 41aw. The dream of the “perfect partner” is an attempt to find EXTERNAL\nintegration, while retaining conflicting needs in the self.\n\nT  B 41ax. B. was somewhat less guilty of this than you, but largely because he\nwas more afraid. He had abandoned the hope (of finding a perfect partner) in a\nneurotic sense of despair of finding it. You, on the other hand, insisted that\nthe hope was justified. Neither of you, therefore, was in your Right Mind.\n\nT  B 41ay. As was said before, homosexuality is INHERENTLY more risky (or error\nprone) than heterosexuality, but both can be undertaken on an equally false\nbasis. The falseness of the basis is clear in the accompanying fantasies.\nHomosexuality ALWAYS involves misperception of the self OR the partner, and\ngenerally both.\n\nT  B 41az. Penetration DOES NOT involve magic, nor DOES ANY form of sexual\nbehavior. It IS a magic belief to engage in ANY form of body image activity at\nall. You neither created yourselves, nor controlled your creation. By introducing\nlevels into your own perception, you opened the way for body-image distortions.\n\nT  B 41ba. The lack of love (or faulty need-orientation) which led to your\nparticular person (not OBJECT) choices CAN BE corrected within the existent\nframework, and would HAVE to be in the larger interest of overall progress. The\nsituation is questionable largely because of its inherent vulnerability to\nfantasy-gratification. Doing the best you can WITHIN this limitation is probably\nthe best corrective measure at present. Any relationship you have undertaken for\nwhatever reasons becomes a responsibility.\n\nT  B 41bb. If you shift your own needs, some amount of corresponding shift in\nthe need-orientation of the other person MUST result, This will be beneficial,\neven if the partner was originally attracted to you BECAUSE of your disrespect.\nTeaching devices which are totally alien to a learner's perceptual system are\nusually merely disruptive. Transfer depends on SOME common elements in the new\nsituation which are understandable in terms of the old.\n\nT  B 41bc. Man can never control the effects of fear himself, because he has\nCREATED fear and believes in what he creates. In attitude, then, though not in\ncontent, he resembles his own Creator, who has perfect faith in His Creations\nbecause he Created them. All creation rests on belief, and the belief in the\ncreation produces its existence. This is why it is possible for a man to believe\nwhat is not true for anyone else. It is true for him because it is made BY him.\n\nT  B 41bd. Every aspect of fear proceeds from upside down perception. The TRULY\ncreative devote their efforts to correcting this. The neurotic devotes his to\ncompromise. The psychotic tries to escape by establishing the truth of his own\nerrors. It is most difficult to free him by ordinary means, only because he is\nmore stable in his denial of truth.\n\nThe miracle makes no distinction among degrees of misperception. It is\na device for perception-correction which is effective quite apart from either the\ndegree or the direction of the error. This is its TRUE indiscriminateness.\n\nT  B 42b. Christ-controlled miracles are selective only in that they are\ndirected toward those who can use them for THEMSELVES. Since this makes it\ninevitable that they will extend them to others, a very strong chain of Atonement\nis welded. But Christ-control takes no account at all of the MAGNITUDE of the\nmiracle itself, because the concept of size exists only in a plane that is itself\nunreal. Since the miracle aims at RESTORING reality, it would hardly be useful if\nit were bound by the laws of the same error it aims to correct. Only man makes\nthat kind of error. It is an example of the “foolish consistency” his own false\nbeliefs have engendered.\n\nT  B 42c. Both the power and the strength of man's creative will must be\nunderstood, before the real meaning of denial can be appreciated and abolished.\nDenial is NOT mere negation. It is a positive miscreation. While the miscreation\nis NECESSARILY believed in by its own creator, it does not exist at all at the\nlevel of true Creation.\n\nThe miracle compares the creations of man with the higher level of\ncreation, accepting what is in ACCORD as true, and rejecting the DISCORDANT as\nfalse. This is why it is so closely associated with validity. Real validity is\nboth true AND useful, or better, it is useful BECAUSE it is true.\n\nT  B 43b. All aspects of fear are untrue, because they DO NOT exist at the\nhigher creative levels, and therefore do not exist at all. To whatever extent a\nman is willing to submit his beliefs to the real test of validity, to that extent\nare his perceptions healed (or corrected.)\n\nT  B 43c. In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds much\nalong the lines suggested very correctly by B., i.e.:\n\nIf perfect love casts out fear,\n\nAnd if fear exists,\n\nThen there is NOT perfect love.\n\nBut\n\nOnly perfect love really exists.\n\nT  B 43c. Therefore, if there is fear, it creates a state which does not exist.\nBelieve THIS and you WILL be free. Only God can establish this solution, for THIS\nfaith IS His gift.",

    "content": "Distortions of Miracle Impulses\n\nMan must contribute to his readiness here as elsewhere. The readiness\nfor faith, as for everything else that is true, entails the two steps necessary\nfor the release from fear.\n\nDenial of fear, in human terms, is a strong defense because it entails\ntwo levels of error:\n\n1. That truth CAN be denied and\n\n2. That absence of truth can be effective.\n\nEXPERIENCING fear, which is more characteristic of B., involves only\nthe second error. However, these differences do not affect the power of the\nmiracle at all, since only truth and error are its concern.\n\nYOU are both more miracle-minded, and less able to recognize fear\nbecause of your stronger, but split, identification. B., also characteristically,\nis less miracle-minded, but better able to recognize fear, because his\nidentification is more consistently right but weaker.\n\nTogether, the conditions needed for consistent miracle-mindedness, the\nstate in which fear has been abolished, can be particularly well worked out. In\nfact, it WAS already well worked out before.\n\nYour idea about the real meaning of “possession” should be clarified.\nYour own denial of fear (this refers to a visionary experience of HS) introduced\nsome error variance, but not really a significant amount. However, there is\nalways a chance that as the size of the sample increases, what was nonsignificant\nbefore may ATTAIN significance, so we had better get this out of the\nway now while you are still within the safety margin.\n\nFear of possession is a perverted expression of the fear of the\nirresistible attraction. (Aside. Yes, this DOES apply to homosexuality, among\nother errors, where the whole concept of possessing, or “entering” is a key fear.\nIt is a symbolic statement of an inverted decision NOT to enter into, or possess,\nthe Kingdom. In physical terms, which it emphasizes because of the inherent error\nof Soul avoidance, REAL physical creation is avoided, and fantasy gratification\nis substituted.)\n\nThe truth is still that the attraction of God is irresistible at ALL\nlevels, and the acceptance of this totally unavoidable truth is only a matter of\ntime. But you should consider whether you WANT to wait, because you CAN return\nnow, if you choose. (Note to HS: You are writing this with improper motivation,\nbut we will try anyway. If you are to stop, do so immediately.)\n\nPossession is a concept which has been subject to numerous\ndistortions, some of which we will list below:\n\n1. It (possession) can be associated with the body only. If this occurs, sex is\nparticularly likely to be contaminated. Possession versus being possessed is apt\nto be seen as the male and female role. Since neither will be conceived of as\nsatisfying alone, and both will be associated with fear, this interpretation is\nparticularly vulnerable to psychosexual confusion.\n\n2. From a rather similar misperceptual reference point, possession can also be\nassociated with things. This is essentially a shift from ), and is usually due\nto an underlying fear of associating possession with people. In this sense, it is\nan attempt to PROTECT people, like the superstition about “protecting the name,”\nwe mentioned before.\n\nBoth ) and 2) are likely to become compulsive for several reasons,\nincluding:\n\na. They represent an attempt to escape from the real possession-drive, which\ncannot be satisfied this way.\n\nb. They set up substitute goals, which are usually reasonably easy to attain.\n\nc. They APPEAR to be relatively harmless, and thus SEEM to allay fear. The fact\nthat they usually interfere with good interpersonal relationships can be\ninterpreted, in this culture, as a lack of sophistication on the part of the\nOTHER (not the self), and this induces a false feeling of confidence in the\nsolution, based on reliability NOT validity. It is also fairly easy to find a\npartner who SHARES the illusion. Thus, we have any number of relationships which\nare actually ESTABLISHED on the basis\nof ), and others which HOLD TOGETHER primarily because of the joint interests in 2).\n\nd. The manifestly EXTERNAL emphasis which both entail seems to be a safety\ndevice, and thus permits a false escape from much more basic inhibitions. As a\ncompromise solution, the ILLUSION of interpersonal relating is preserved, along\nwith the retention of the lack of love component. This kind of psychic juggling\nleaves the person (or juggler?) with a feeling of emptiness, which in fact is\nperfectly justified, because he IS acting from scarcity. He then becomes more and\nmore driven in his behavior, to fill the emptiness.\n\nWhen these solutions have been invested with extreme belief, ) leads\nto sex crimes, and ) to stealing. The kleptomaniac is a good example of the\nlatter.\n\nT 1 C 12. Generally, two types of emotional disturbances result:\n\na. The tendency to maintain the illusion that only the physical is real. This\nproduces depression.\n\nb. The tendency to invest the physical with non-physical properties. This is\nessentially magic, and tends more toward anxiety-proneness.\n\nc. The tendency to vacillate from one to the other, which produces a\ncorresponding vacillation between depression AND anxiety.\n\nBoth result in self imposed starvation.\n\n3. Another type of distortion is seen in the fear of or desire for\n“spirit” possession. The term “spirit” is profoundly debased in this context, but\nit DOES entail a recognition that\nthe body is not enough, and investing it with magic will not work. This\nrecognition ACCEPTS the fact that neither ) nor 2) is sufficient, but, precisely\nBECAUSE it does not limit fear so narrowly, it is more likely to produce greater\nfear in its own right.\n\nEndowing the Spirit with human possessiveness is a more INCLUSIVE\nerror than ) or 2), and a step somewhat further away from the “Right Mind.”\nProjection is also more likely to occur, with vacillations between grandiosity\nand fear. “Religion” in a distorted sense, is also more likely to occur in this\nkind of error, because the idea of a “spirit” is introduced, though fallaciously,\nwhile it is excluded from ) and 2).\n\nWitchcraft is thus particularly apt to be associated with ), because\nof the much greater investment in magic.\n\nIt should be noted that ) involves only the body, and 2) involves an\nattempt to associate things with human attributes. Three, on the other hand, is a\nmore serious level confusion, because it endows the Spirit with EVIL attributes.\nThis accounts both for the religious zeal of its proponents, and the aversion (or\nfear) of its opponents. Both attitudes stem from the same false belief.\n\nThis is NOT what the Bible means by “possessed of the Holy Spirit.” It\nis interesting to note that even those who DID understand that could nevertheless\nEXPRESS their understanding inappropriately. The concept of “speaking\nin many tongues” was originally an injunction to communicate to everyone in his\nown language, or his own level. It hardly meant to speak in a way that NOBODY can\nunderstand. This strange error occurs when people DO understand the need for\nUniversal communication, but have contaminated it with possession fallacies. The\nfear engendered by this misperception leads to a conflicted state in which\ncommunication IS attempted, but the fear is allayed by making the communication\nincomprehensible.\n\nIt could also be said that the fear induced selfishness, or\nregression, because incomprehensible communication is hardly a worthy offering\nfrom one Son of God to another.\n\n4. Knowledge can also be misinterpreted as a means of possession.\nHere, the content is not physical, and the underlying fallacy is more likely to\nbe the confusion of mind and brain. The attempt to unite nonphysical content with\nphysical attributes is illustrated by statements like “the thirst for knowledge.”\n(No Helen, this is NOT what the “thirst” in the Bible means. The term was used\nonly because of man's limited comprehension, and is probably better dropped.)\n\nThe fallacious use of knowledge can result in several errors,\nincluding:\n\na. The idea that knowledge will make the individual more attractive to others.\nThis is a possession-fallacy.\n\nb. The idea that knowledge will make the individual invulnerable. This is the\nreaction formation against the underlying fear of vulnerability.\n\nc. The idea that knowledge will make the individual worthy. This is largely\npathetic.\n\nBoth you and B. should consider type ) VERY carefully. Like all these\nfallacies, it contains a denial mechanism, which swings into operation as the\nfear increases, thus canceling out the error temporarily, but seriously impairing\nefficiency.\n\nThus, you claim you can't read, and B. claims that he can't speak.\nNote that depression is a real risk here, for a Child of God should never REDUCE\nhis efficiency in ANY way. The depression comes from a peculiar pseudo-solution\nwhich reads:\n\nA Child of God is efficient.\n\nI am not efficient.\n\nTherefore, I am not a Child of God.\n\nThis leads to neurotic resignation, and this is a state which merely\nINCREASES the depression.\n{(Ed. Note) The following shows up and is crossed out, and is repeated on page \nwith the last sentence missing:}\n\nThe corresponding denial mechanism for 1) is the sense of PHYSICAL\ninability, or IMPOTENCE. The denial mechanism for ) is often bankruptcy.\nCollectors of things often drive themselves well beyond their financial means, in\nan attempt to force discontinuance. If this idea of cessation cannot be\ntolerated, a strange compromise involving BOTH insatiable possessiveness and\ninsatiable throwing-away (bankruptcy) may result. An example is the inveterate or\ncompulsive gambler, particularly the horse-racing addict. Here, the conflicted\ndrive is displaced both from people AND things, and is invested in animals. The\nimplied DEROGATION of people is the cause of the underlying EXTREME superstition\nof the horse racing addict.",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThis section is inserted here because it deals with a more fundamental\nmisuse of knowledge, referred to in the Bible as the cause of the Fall (or\nSeparation). There are several introductory remarks which are intended to make\nthese explanations less fear-provoking. The first is a couplet which I drew to\nyour attention during the fragments of Midsummer Night's Dream, which you heard\nlast night:\n\n“Be as thou wast wont to be\n\nSee as thou wast wont to see.”\n\nIt is noteworthy that these words were said by Oberon in releasing Titania from\nher own errors, both of being and perceiving. These were the words which reestablished\nher true identity as well as her true abilities and judgment. The\nsimilarity here is obvious.\n\nThere are also some definitions, which I asked you to take from the\ndictionary, which will also be helpful. Their somewhat unusual nature is due to\nthe fact that they are not first definitions in their chronological appearance.\nNevertheless, the fact that each of them does appear in the dictionary should be\nreassuring.\n\nProject (verb): to extend forward or out.\n\nProject (noun): a plan in the mind\n\nWorld: a natural grand division. (Note that you originally wrote “word”\ninstead of “world.”)\n\nWe will refer later to projection as related to both mental illness\nand mental health. It will also be commented on that Lucifer literally projected\nhimself from heaven. We also have observed that man can create an empty shell,\nbut cannot create nothing at all.\nThis emptiness provides the screen for the misuse of projection.\n\nThe Garden of Eden, which is described as a literal garden in the\nBible, was not originally an actual garden at all. It was merely a mental state\nof complete need-lack. Even in the literal account, it is noteworthy that the\npre-Separation state was essentially one in which man needed nothing. The Tree of\nKnowledge, again an overly-literal concept, (as is clearly shown by the\nsubsequent reference to “eating of the fruit of the tree”) is a symbolic\nreference to some of the misuses of knowledge referred to in the section\nimmediately preceding this one. There is, however, considerable clarification of\nthis concept, which must be understood before the real meaning of the “detour\ninto fear” can be fully comprehended. Projection, as defined above, (this refers\nto the verb) is a fundamental attribute of God, which he also gave to his Son. In\nthe Creation, God projected his Creative Ability out of Himself toward the Souls\nwhich He created, and also imbued them with the same loving wish (or will) to\ncreate. We have commented before on the FUNDAMENTAL error involved in confusing\nwhat has been created with what is being created. We have also emphasized that\nman, insofar as the term relates to Soul, has not only been fully Created, but\nalso been created perfect. There is no emptiness in him. The next point, too, has\nalready been made, but bears repetition here. The Soul, because of its own\nlikeness to its Creator, is creative. No Child of God is capable of losing this\nability, because it is inherent in what he IS.\n\nWhenever projection in its inappropriate sense is utilized, it ALWAYS\nimplies that some emptiness (or lack of everything) must exist, and that it is\nwithin man's ability to put his own ideas there INSTEAD of the truth. If you will\nconsider carefully what this entails, the following will become quite apparent:\n\nFirst, the assumption is implicit that what God has Created can be changed by the\nmind of Man.\n\nSecond, the concept that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect (or wanting)\nis intruded.\n\nThird, the belief that man can distort the Creations of God (including himself)\nhas arisen, and is tolerated.\n\nFourth, that since man can create himself, the direction of his own creation is\nup to him.\n\nThese related distortions represent a picture of what actually\noccurred in the Separation. None of this existed before, nor does it actually\nexist now. The world, as defined above, WAS made as a natural grand division, or\nprojecting outward of God. That is why everything which He Created is like Him.\n\nIt should be noted that the opposite of pro is con. Strictly speaking,\nthen, the opposite of projecting is conjecting, a term which referred to a state\nof uncertainty or guess work. Other errors arise in connection with ancillary\ndefenses, to be considered later.\nFor example, dejection, which is obviously associated with depression, injection,\nwhich can be misinterpreted readily enough, in terms of possession fallacies\n(particularly penetration), and rejection, which is clearly associated with\ndenial. It should be noted also that rejection can be used as refusing, a term\nwhich necessarily involves a perception of what is refused as something unworthy.\n\nProjection as undertaken by God was very similar to the kind of inner\nradiance which the Children of the Father inherit from Him. It is important to\nnote that the term “project outward” necessarily implies that the real source of\nprojection is internal.\nThis is as true of the Son as of the Father.\n\nThe world, in its original connotation, included both the proper\ncreation of man by God, AND the proper creation by man in his Right Mind. The\nlatter required the endowment of man by God with free will, because all loving\ncreation is freely given. Nothing in either of these statements implies any sort\nof level involvement, or, in fact, anything except one continuous line of\ncreation, in which all aspects are of the same order.\n\nWhen the “lies of the serpent” were introduced, they were specifically\ncalled lies because they are not true. When man listened, all he heard was\nuntruth. He does not have to continue to believe what is not true, unless he\nchooses to do so. All of his miscreations can disappear in the well known\n“twinkling of an eye,” because it is a visual misperception.\n\nMan's spiritual eye can sleep, but as will shortly appear in the notes\n(reference Bob, elevator operator) a sleeping eye can still see. One translation\nof the Fall, a view emphasized by Mary Baker Eddy, and worthy of note, is that “a\ndeep sleep fell upon Adam.” While the Bible continues to associate this sleep as\na kind of anesthetic utilized for protection of Adam during the creation of Eve,\nMrs. Eddy was correct in emphasizing that nowhere is there any reference made to\nhis waking up. While Christian Science is clearly incomplete, this point is much\nin its favor.\n\nThe history of man in the world as he saw it has not been\ncharacterized by any genuine or comprehensive re-awakening, or re-birth.\nThis is impossible as long as man projects in the spirit of miscreation. It still\nremains within him to project as God projected his own Spirit to him. In reality,\nthis is his ONLY choice, because his free will was made for his own joy in\ncreating the perfect.\n\nAll fear is ultimately reducible to the basic misperception of man's\nability to USURP the power of God. It is again emphasized that he neither CAN nor\nHAS been able to do this. In this statement lies the real justification for his\nescape from fear. This is brought about by his acceptance of the Atonement, which\nplaces him in a position to realize that his own errors never really occurred.\n\nWhen the deep sleep fell upon Adam, he was then in a condition to\nexperience nightmares, precisely because he was sleeping. If a light is suddenly\nturned on while someone is dreaming, and the content of his dream is fearful, he\nis initially likely to interpret the light itself as part of the content of his\nown dream. However, as soon as he awakens, the light is correctly perceived as\nthe release from the dream, which is no longer accorded reality. I would like to\nconclude this with the Biblical injunction “Go ye and do likewise.” It is quite\napparent that this depends on the kind of knowledge which was NOT referred to by\nthe “Tree of Knowledge” which bore lies as fruit. The knowledge that illuminates\nrather than obscures is the knowledge which not only makes you free, but also\nshows you clearly that you ARE free.\n\n\nThe preceding sections were inserted because of the necessity of\ndistinguishing between real and false knowledge. Having made this distinction, it\nis well to return to the errors already listed a while back. It might be well to\nrecapitulate them here. The first involved the fallacy that only the physical is\nreal. The second involved things rather than people. The third involves the\nendowment of the physical with non-physical properties. And the fourth clarified\nthe misuse of knowledge. All of them were subsumed under possession fallacies.\nThe denial mechanism for three has already been set forth in some detail, and\nwill also continue after the following:\n\nThe corresponding denial mechanism for ) is the sense of PHYSICAL\ninability, or IMPOTENCE. The denial mechanism for ) is often bankruptcy.\nCollectors of things often drive themselves well beyond their financial means, in\nan attempt to force discontinuance. If this idea of cessation cannot be\ntolerated, a strange compromise involving BOTH insatiable possessiveness and\ninsatiable throwing-away (bankruptcy) may result. An example is the inveterate or\ncompulsive gambler, particularly the horse-racing addict. Here, the conflicted\ndrive is displaced both from people AND things, and is invested in animals. The\nimplied DEROGATION of people is the cause of the underlying EXTREME superstition\nof the horse racing addict.\n\nThe alcoholic is in a similar position, except that his hostility is\nmore inward than outward directed.\n\nDefenses aimed at protecting (or retaining) error are particularly\nhard to undo, because they introduce second-order misperceptions which obscure\nthe underlying errors still further.\n\nThe pseudo-corrective mechanism of three is apt to be more varied\nbecause of the more inclusive nature of the error, which has already been\nmentioned. Some of the possibilities are listed below:\n\nOne aspect of the possession/possessed conflict can be raised to\npredominance. If this is attempted in connection with POSSESSING, it leads to the\nparanoid solution. The underlying component of “being possessed” is retained in\nthe “persecution” fantasies, which are generally concomitants.\n\nIf “being possessed” is brought to ascendance, a state of some sort of\npossession by external forces results, but NOT with a major emphasis on attacking\nothers. Attack BY others becomes the more obvious component. In the more virulent\nforms, there is a sense of being possessed by demons, and unless there is\nvacillation with a), a catatonic solution is more likely than a paranoid one.\n\nThe FOCUSED paranoid has become more rigid in his solution, and\ncenters on ONE source of projection to escape from vacillation. (Aside: It should\nbe noted that this type of paranoia is an upside down form of religion, because\nof its obvious attempt to unify into oneness.)\n\nBoth , 2, and 4 are more likely to produce NEUROTIC83 rather than\npsychotic states, though this is by no means guaranteed. However,  is inherently\nmore vulnerable to the psychotic correction, again because of the more\nfundamental level confusion which is involved.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that the greater fear which is induced by  can ITSELF reach psychotic proportions, thus forcing the individual closer and\ncloser to a psychotic solution.\n\nIt is emphasized here that these differences have no effect at all on\nthe miracle, which can heal any of them with equal ease. This is because of the\nmiracle's inherent avoidance of within-error distinctions. Its SOLE concern is to\ndistinguish between truth, on the one hand, and ALL kinds of error, on the other.\nThis is why some miracles SEEM to be of greater magnitude than others. But\nremember the first point in this course, i.e., that there is no order of\ndifficulty in miracles.\n\nThe emphasis on mental illness which is marked in these notes reflects\nthe “UNDOING” aspect of the miracle. The “DOING” aspect is, of course, much more\nimportant. But a true miracle cannot occur on a false basis. Sometimes the\nundoing must precede it.\n\nAt other times, both can occur simultaneously, but you are not up to\nthis at the moment.\n\nFurther, insights into mental illness can be misused, and lead to\npreoccupation with one's own symptoms. This is why this area is less constructive\nfor most people than a course primarily devoted to mental health. However, some\nprofessions will find (some?) principles of mental illness constructive,\nespecially those which are concerned with mental illness in others. This\nobviously includes psychologists.\n\nThe obvious correction for ALL types of the possession-fallacy is to\nredefine possession correctly. In the sense of “taking over,” the concept does\nnot exist at all in divine reality, which is the only level of reality where real\nexistence is a meaningful term.\n\nNo one CAN be “taken over” unless he wills to be. However, if he\nplaces his mind under tyranny, rather than authority, he intrudes the\nsubmission/dominance onto free will himself. This produces the obvious\ncontradiction inherent in any formulation that associates free will with\nimprisonment. Even in very mild forms, this kind of association is risky, and may\nspread quite unexpectedly, particularly under external stress. This is because it\ncan be internally controlled ONLY if EXTERNAL conditions are peaceful. This is\nnot safe, because external conditions are produced by the thoughts of many, not\nall of whom are pure in heart as yet.\n\nWhy should you be at THEIR mercy? This issue is VERY closely related\nto the whole possession issue. You insist on thinking that people CAN possess\nyou, if you believe that their thoughts (or the external environment) can affect\nyou, regardless of WHAT they think. You are perfectly unaffected by ALL\nexpressions of lack of love. These can be either from yourself and others, or\nfrom yourself to others, or from others to you. (I'm glad you passed that test.\nIt was crucial. This is ref. to HS reluctance to take dictations as given.)\n\nPeace is an attribute in YOU. You cannot find it outside. All mental\nillness is some form of EXTERNAL searching. Mental health is INNER peace. It\nenables you to remain unshaken by lack of love from without, and capable, through\nyour own miracles of correcting the external conditions, which proceed from lack\nof love in others.",

    "content": "The Re-interpretation of Defenses\n\nWhen you are afraid of ANYTHING, you are acknowledging its power to\nhurt you. Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also. This\nmeans that you believe in what you VALUE.\n\nTHIS peace is totally incapable of being shaken by human errors of any\nkind. It denies the ability of anything which is not of God to effect you in any\nway.\n\nThis is the PROPER use of denial. It is not used to HIDE anything, but\nit IS used to correct error. It brings ALL error into the light, and since error\nand darkness are the same, it abolishes error automatically.\n\nTrue denial is a very powerful protective device. You can and should\ndeny any belief that error can hurt you. This kind of denial is NOT a concealment\ndevice, but a correction device. The “Right Mind” of the mentally healthy DEPENDS\non it.\n\nYou can do ANYTHING I ask. I have asked you to perform miracles, and\nhave made it VERY clear that these are NATURAL, CORRECTIVE, HEALING, and\nUNIVERSAL. There is nothing good they cannot do. But they cannot be performed in\nthe spirit of doubt. Remember my own question, before you ask yours “Oh ye of\nlittle faith, wherefore didsth thou DOUBT.” (Reference to Christ and the\napostles walking on water.)\n\nYou have asked YOURSELVES why you cannot really incorporate my words\n(the idea of cannibalism in connection with the Sacrament is a reflection of a\ndistorted view of sharing. I told you before that the word “thirst” in connection\nwith the Spirit was used in the Bible because of the limited understanding of\nthose to whom I spoke. I also told you NOT to use it. The same holds for\nexpressions like “feeding on.”)\n\nGod and the Souls He created ARE symbiotically related. They are\nCOMPLETELY dependent on each other. The creation of the Soul itself has already\nbeen perfectly accomplished, but the creation BY Souls has not. God created Souls\nso He could depend on them BECAUSE He created them perfectly. He gave them His\npeace so they would not be shaken, and would be unable to be deceived. Whenever\nyou are afraid, you ARE deceived. Your mind is NOT serving your Soul. This\nliterally starves the Soul by denying its daily bread. Remember the poem about\nthe Holy Family which crossed your mind last night:\n“Where tricks of words are never said\nAnd mercy is as plain as bread.”\nThe reason why that had such a strong impact on you originally was because you\nknew what it MEANT.\n\nGod offers ONLY mercy. Your own words should ALWAYS reflect only\nmercy, because that is what you have received, and that is what you should GIVE.\nJustice is a temporary expedient, or an attempt to teach man the meaning of\nmercy. Its JUDGMENTAL side rises only because man is capable of INJUSTICE if that\nis what his mind creates. You are afraid of God's will because you have used your\nown will, which He created in the likeness of His own, to MISCREATE.\n\nWhat you do NOT realize is that the mind can miscreate only when it is\nNOT free. An imprisoned mind is not free by definition. It is possessed, or held\nback, by ITSELF. Its will is therefore limited, and not free to assert itself.\n\nThe three things that crossed your mind, which was comparatively free\nat the time, are perfectly relevant:\n\n1. It is alright to remember the past, PROVIDED you also remember that\nANYTHING you suffer is because of YOUR OWN ERRORS.\n\n2. In this context, your remark that “after the burning, I swore if I\never saw him again, I would (not) (“Not” was written in later) recognize him.\nNote, by the way, that you did not put in the “not” until afterwards. That is\nbecause your inherent correction-device was working properly at the moment. The\nresult is that you are NOT DENYING ME.\n\n3. The story about Hinda. This was an excellent example of\nmisperception which led to a totally unwarranted fear of a PERSON. (HS story\nrefers to a very young child who fell down the stairs when HS had arms open in a\nwelcoming gesture at bottom of stairs. For years afterwards, Hinda screamed upon\nseeing HS.) The mis-step which caused her fall had nothing at all to do with you,\njust as your own mis-steps have nothing at all to do with me.\n\nDenial of error is a very powerful defense of truth. We have slowly\nbeen shifting the emphasis from the negative to the positive use of denial.\nRemember, we have already stated that denial is not a purely negative device; it\nresults in positive miscreation. That is the way the mentally ill DO employ it.\n\nBut remember a very early thought of your own, “Never underestimate\nthe power of denial.” In the service of the “Right Mind,” the denial of ERROR\nfrees the mind and re-establishes the freedom of the will. When the will is\nREALLY free, it CANNOT miscreate, because it recognizes ONLY TRUTH.\n\nProjection arises out of FALSE DENIAL. Not out of its proper use. My\nown role in the Atonement IS one of true projection, i.e., I can project to YOU\nthe affirmation of truth. If you project error to me (or to yourself) you are\ninterfering with the process. My use of projection, which can also be yours, is\nNOT based on faulty denial. But it DOES involve the very powerful use of the\ndenial of error.\n\nThe miracle worker is one who accepts my kind of denial and\nprojection, unites his own inherent abilities to deny and project with mine, and\nimposes them back on himself and others. This establishes the total lack of\nthreat anywhere. Together we can then work for the real time of peace, which is\nEternal.\n\nI inspired Bob (ref. to elevator man who took HS down from her apt.)\nto make that remark to you, and it is a pity that you heard only the last part.\nBut you can still use that. His remark ended with: “Every shut eye is not\nasleep.” Since your own vision is much improved at the moment, we will go on a\nwhile.\n\nFreud's identification of mechanisms was quite correct, as was his\nrecognition of their creative ability. They can INDEED create man's perception,\nboth of himself and his surroundings.\n\nBut Freud's limitations induced inevitable limits on his own\nperception. He made two kinds of errors.\n\nThe first is that he saw only how the mechanisms worked in the\nmentally ill.\n\nThe second is his own denial of the mechanism of the Atonement.\n\nLet us take up the first, because a clear understanding of the second\ndepends on it.\n\nDenial should be directed only to error, and projection should be\nlimited to truth. You should truly give as you have truly received. The Golden\nRule can work effectively only on this basis.\n\nIntellectualization is a poor word, which stems from the brain-mind\nconfusion. “Right-Mindedness” is better. This device defends the RIGHT MIND, and\ngives it control over the body. “Intellectualization” implies a split, whereas\n“Right-Mindedness” involves healing.\n\nWithdrawal is properly employed in the service of withdrawing from the\ndesert. It is NOT a device for escape, but for consolidation. There IS only One\nMind.\n\nDissociation is quite similar. You should split yourself off from\nerror, but only in defense of integration.\n\nDetachment is essentially a weaker form of dissociation. This is one\nof the major areas of withholding that both you and B. are engaging in.\n\nFlight can be undertaken in whatever direction you choose, but note\nthat the concept itself implies flight FROM something. Flight from error is\nperfectly appropriate.\n\nDistantiation is a way of putting distance between yourself and what\nyou SHOULD fly from.\n\nRegression is a real effort to return to your own original state. In\nthis sense, it is utilized to RESTORE, not to go back to the less mature.\n\nSublimation should be associated with the SUBLIME.\n\nThere are many other so-called “dynamic” concepts which are profound\nerrors due essentially to the misuse of defenses. Among them is the concept of\ndifferent levels of aspiration, which results from real level confusion.\n\nHowever, the main point to be understood from these notes is that you\ncan defend truth as well as error, and in fact, much better.\n\nSo far we have concentrated on ends rather than means because unless\nyou regard an end as worth achieving, you will not devote yourself to the means\nby which it can BE achieved. Your own question enabled me to shift the emphasis\nfrom end to means. (Question asked was “how can we incorporate this material?”)\nYou and B. HAVE accepted the end as valuable, thus signifying your willingness to\nuse defenses to ensure it.\n\nThe means are easier to clarify after the true worth of the goal\nitself is firmly established.\n\nEveryone defends his own treasure. You do not have to tell him to do\nthis, because HE will do so automatically. The real question still remains WHAT\ndo you treasure, and HOW MUCH do you treasure it?\n\nOnce you learn to consider these two points, and bring them into ALL\nyour actions as the true criteria for behavior, I will have little difficulty in\nclarifying the means. You have not learned to be consistent about this as yet. I\nhave therefore concentrated on showing you that the means ARE available whenever\nyou DO ask.\n\nYou can save a lot of time, however, if you do not need to extend this\nstep unduly. The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably.\n\nPapers will be very easy to write as this time is shortened.\n\nThe Atonement is the ONLY defense which cannot be used destructively.\nThat is because, while everyone must eventually join it, it was not a device\nwhich was generated by man. The Atonement PRINCIPLE was in effect long before the\nAtonement itself was begun. The Principle was love, and the Atonement itself, was\nan ACT of love. Acts were not necessary before the Separation, because the timespace\nbelief did not exist.\n\nIt was only after the Separation that the defense of Atonement, and\nthe necessary conditions for its fulfillment were planned. It became increasingly\napparent that all of the defenses which man can choose to use constructively or\ndestructively were not enough to save him. It was therefore decided that he\nneeded a defense which was so splendid that he could not misuse it, although he\nCOULD refuse it. His will could not turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the\ninherent characteristic of all other defenses. The Atonement thus becomes the\nonly defense which was NOT a two-edged sword.\n\nThe Atonement actually began long before the Crucifixion. Many Souls\noffered their efforts on behalf of the Separated Ones but they could not\nwithstand the strength of the attack, and had to be brought back. Angels came,\ntoo, but their protection was not enough, because the Separated ones were not\ninterested in peace. They had already split themselves, and were bent on dividing\nrather than reintegrating. The levels they introduced into themselves turned\nagainst each other, and they, in turn, turned against each other. They\nestablished differences, divisions, cleavages, dispersion, and all the other\nconcepts related to the increasing splits they produced.\n\nNot being in their Right Minds, they turned their defenses from\nprotection to assault, and acted literally insanely. It was essential to\nintroduce a split-proof device which could be used ONLY to heal, if it was used\nat all.\n\nThe Atonement was built into the space-time belief in order to set a\nlimit on the need for the belief, and ultimately to make learning complete. The\nAtonement IS the final lesson. Learning itself, like the classrooms in which it\noccurs, is temporary. Let all those who overestimate human intelligence remember\nthis. (HS questions last sentence, which she perceives as threatening.) The\nability to learn has no value when change of understanding is no longer\nnecessary. The eternally creative have nothing to learn. Only after the\nSeparation was it necessary to direct the creative force to learning, because\nchanged behavior had become mandatory.\n\nHuman beings can learn to improve their behavior, and can also learn\nto become better and better learners. This increase serves (HS notes that this\nwas written \"served\") to bring them in closer and closer accord with the Sonship.\nBut the Sonship itself is a perfect creation, and perfection is not a matter of\ndegree. Only while there are different degrees is learning meaningful. The\nevolution of man is merely a process by which he proceeds from one degree to the\nnext. He corrects his previous missteps by stepping forward. This represents a\nprocess which is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms, because he RETURNS\nas he progresses. (Originally, was \"goes forward,” rather than \"progresses\")\n\nThe Atonement is the device by which he can free himself from the past\nas he goes ahead. It UNDOES his past errors, thus making it unnecessary for him\nto keep retracing his steps without advancing toward his return.\n\nIn this sense, the Atonement saves time, but, like the miracle which\nserves it, does not abolish it. As long as there is need for Atonement, there is\nneed for time. But the Atonement, as a completed plan, does have a unique\nrelationship TO time. Until the Atonement is finished, its various phases will\nproceed IN time, but the whole Atonement stands at its end. At this point, the\nbridge of the return has been built.\n\n(Note to HS. The reason this is upsetting you is because the Atonement\nis a TOTAL commitment. You still think this is associated with loss. This is the\nsame mistake ALL the Separated ones make, in one way or another. They cannot\nbelieve that a defense which CANNOT attack also IS the best defense. Except for\nthis misperception, the angels COULD have helped them. What do you think \"the\nmeek shall inherit the earth\" MEANS? They will literally take it over because of\ntheir strength. A two-way defense is inherently weak, precisely BECAUSE it has\ntwo edges it can turn against the self very unexpectedly. This tendency CANNOT be\ncontrolled EXCEPT by miracles.)\n\nThe miracle turns the defense of Atonement to the protection of the\ninner self, which, as it becomes more and more secure; assumes its natural talent\nof protecting others. The inner self knows itself as both a brother AND a son.\n\n(The above notes were taken with great difficulty by HS, and\nconstitute the only series thus far that were written very slowly. When HS asked\nabout this, she was told, \"don't worry about the notes. They are right, but YOU\nare not sufficiently Right-Minded yet to write about the Atonement with comfort.\nYou will write about it yet with joy.)\n\nT 2 B 52. (Aside from HS: Last night I felt briefly but intensely depressed,\ntemporarily under the impression that I was abandoned. I tried, but couldn't get\nthrough at all. After a while, I decided to give up for the time being, and He\nsaid, \"don't worry. I will never leave you or forsake you.\" I did feel a little\nbetter, and decided I was really not sick, so I could return to my exercises.\nWhile I was exercising, I had some part-vision experiences which I found only\nmildly frightening at times, and quite reassuring at others.\n\nI am not too sure of the sequence, but it began with a VERY clear\nassurance of love, and an equally clear emphasis on my own great value, beauty,\nand purity. Things got a little confusing after that. First, the idea of \"Bride\nof Christ\" occurred to me with vaguely inappropriate \"undertones.” Then there was\na repetition of \"the way of Love,” and a restatement of an earlier experience,\nnow as if it were FROM Him TO me: \"Behold the Handmaid of the Lord; Be it done\nunto you according to His Word.\" (This threw me into panic before, but at that\ntime, it was stated in the more accurate Biblical phrasing: \"Be it done unto ME\naccording to HIS Word.”)\n\nThis time I was a bit uneasy, but remembered I had misperceived it last time, and\nwas probably still not seeing it right. Actually, it is really just a statement\nof allegiance to the Divine Service, which can hardly be dangerous.\n\nThen there was a strange sequence, in which Christ seemed to be making\nvery obvious advances, which became quite sexual in my perception of them. I\nALMOST thought briefly that he turned into a devil. I got just a LITTLE scared,\nand the possession idea came in for a while, but I thought it SO silly, that\nthere is no point in taking it seriously.\n\n(As I am writing this, I remember that thing in the book about the\ndemon lover, which once THROUGH me (note spelling, \"threw\") into a fit. I am\nupset, but the spelling slip is reassuring.\n\nThis morning we reviewed the whole episode. He said he was \"VERY\npleased at the COMPARATIVE lack of fear, and also the concomitant awareness that\nit WAS misperception. This showed much greater strength, and a much increased\nRight-Mindedness. This is because defenses are now being used much better, on\nbehalf of truth MORE than error, though not completely so.\n\nThe weaker use of mis-projection is shown by my recognition that it\ncan't REALLY be that way, which became possible as soon as denial was applied\nagainst error, NOT truth. This permitted a much greater awareness of alternative\ninterpretations.\n\nIt was also explained (the shift to the passive form instead of \"He\nalso explained\" should be noted. This is an expression of fear.) \"Remember the\nsection in \"Letters from the Scattered Brotherhood\" you read last evening about\n'Hold fast', and please do so.”)\n\n(Note made on /15 by HS re B's remark concerning96 top of p.5)\nYes, but I doubt if it says this is inevitable. It may entail more mis-will than\nwe think. The above may have been too passively interpreted. Note that B. Did\nNOT ask MY will re same. If he had, HE would have felt better.\n\nYou know that when defenses are disrupted there is a period of real\ndisorientation, accompanied by fear, guilt, and usually vacillations between\nanxiety and depression. This process is different only in that defenses are not\nbeing disrupted, but re-interpreted, even though it may be experienced as the\nsame thing.\n\nIn the re-interpretation of defenses, they are not disrupted but their\nuse for ATTACK is lost. Since this means they can be used only ONE way, they\nbecame MUCH stronger, and much more dependable. They no longer oppose the\nAtonement, but greatly facilitate it. The Atonement can only be accepted within\nyou.\n\nYou have perceived it largely as EXTERNAL thus far, and that is why\nyour EXPERIENCE of it has been minimal. You have been SHOWN the chalice many\ntimes, but have not accepted it \"for yourself.” Your major improper use of\ndefenses is now largely limited to externalization. Do not fail to appreciate\nyour own remarkable progress in this respect. You perceived it first as a vessel\nof some sort whose purpose was uncertain but which might be a piss-pot. You DID\nnotice, however, that the INSIDE was gold, while the OUTSIDE, though shiny, was\nsilver. This was a recognition of the fact that the INNER part is more precious\nthan the OUTER side, even though both are resplendent, though with different\nvalue.\n\nThe re-interpretation of defenses is essential to break open the INNER\nlight. Since the Separation, man's defenses have been used almost entirely to\ndefend themselves AGAINST the Atonement, and thus maintain their separation. They\ngenerally see this as a need to protect the body from external intrusion (or\nintruding), and this kind of misperception is largely responsible for the\nhomosexual fallacy, as well as your own pregnancy fears. The so-called \"anal\"\nbehavior is a distorted attempt to \"steal\" the Atonement, and deny its worth by\nconcealing it, and holding onto it with a bodily receptacle, which is regarded as\nparticularly vicious. \"Oral\" fantasies are rather similar in purpose, except that\nthey stem more from a sense of deprivation, and insatiable thirst which results.\n\"Anal\" fallacies are more of a refusal to give, while oral fantasies emphasize a\ndistorted need to take. The main error in both is the belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining Atonement.\n\nPerceiving the body as the Temple is only the first step in correcting\nthis kind of distortion. (HS scalded hand, and looked for butter to put on. It\noccurred to her that the Atonement was the cure. Burn appeared to be minimal, and\ncaused little discomfort.)\n\nSeeing the body as the Temple alters part of the misperception, but\nnot all of it. It DOES recognize, however, that the concept of addition or\nsubtraction in PHYSICAL terms is not appropriate. But the next step is to realize\nthat a Temple is not a building at all. Its REAL holiness lies in the INNER\naltar, around which the building is built. The inappropriate emphasis which men\nhave put on beautiful Church BUILDINGS is a sign of their own fear of Atonement,\nand unwillingness to reach the altar itself. The REAL beauty of the Temple cannot\nbe seen with the physical eye. The spiritual eye, on the other hand, cannot see\nthe building at all, but it perceives the altar within with perfect clarity. This\nis because the spiritual eye has perfect vision.\n\nFor perfect effectiveness, the chalice of the Atonement belongs at the\ncenter of the inner altar, where it undoes the Separation, and restores the\nwholeness of the Spirit. Before the Separation, the mind was invulnerable to\nfear, because fear did not exist. Both the Separation and the fear were\nMISCREATIONS of the mind, which have to be undone. This is what the Bible means\nby the \"Restoration of the Temple.” It DOES NOT mean the restoration of the\nbuilding, but it DOES mean the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement.\n\nThis heals the Separation, and places within man the one defense\nagainst all Separation-mind errors which can make him perfectly invulnerable.\n\nThe acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time.\nIn fact, both TIME and MATTER were created for this purpose. This appears to\ncontradict free will, because of the inevitability of this decision. If you\nreview the idea carefully, you will realize that this is not true. Everything is\nlimited in some way by the manner of its creation. Free will can temporize, and\nis capable of enormous procrastination. But it cannot depart entirely from its\nCreator, who set the limits on its ability to miscreate by virtue of its own real\npurpose.\n\nThe misuse of will engenders a situation which, in the extreme,\nbecomes altogether intolerable. Pain thresholds can be high, but they are not\nlimitless. Eventually, everybody begins to recognize, however dimly, that there\nMUST be a better way. As this recognition is more firmly established, it becomes\na perceptual turning-point. This ultimately reawakens the spiritual eye,\nsimultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight. The alternating\ninvestment in the two types or levels of perception is usually experienced as\nconflict for a long time, and can become very acute.\n\nBut the outcome is as certain as God. The spiritual eye literally\nCANNOT SEE error, and merely looks for Atonement. All the solutions which the\nphysical eyes seek, dissolve in its sight. The spiritual eye, which looks within,\nrecognizes immediately that the altar has been defiled, and needs to be repaired\nand protected. Perfectly aware of the RIGHT defense, it passes over all others,\nlooking past error to truth. Because of the real strength of ITS vision, it pulls\nthe will into its own service, and forces the mind to concur. This reestablishes\nthe true power of the will, and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay.\nThe mind then realizes, with increasing certitude, that delay is only a way of\nincreasing unnecessary pain, which it need not tolerate at all. The pain\nthreshold drops accordingly, and the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what\nit would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.\n\nThe Children of God are entitled to perfect comfort, which comes from\na sense of perfect trust. Until they achieve this, they waste themselves and\ntheir true creative power on useless attempts to make themselves more comfortable\nby inappropriate means. But the real means is ALREADY provided, and does not\ninvolve any efforts on their part at all. Their egocentricity usually\nmisperceives this as personally insulting, an interpretation which obviously\narises from their misperception of themselves. Egocentricity and communion cannot\ncoexist. Even the terms themselves are contradictory.\n\nThe Atonement is the only gift which is worthy of being offered to the\nAltar of God. This is because of the inestimable value of the Altar itself. It\nwas created perfect, and is entirely worthy of receiving perfection. God IS\nlonely without His SOULS, and THEY are lonely without Him. Remember the\n\"spiritual\" (a VERY good term) which begins with \"And God stepped down from\nHeaven and said: I'M lonely - - I'll make ME a World.\" The world WAS a way of\nhealing the Separation, and the Atonement is the GUARANTEE that the device will\nultimately do so.\n\n(HS request for special message for B. Tell B that his delaying\ntactics are holding him back. He does not really understand detachment,\ndistantiation, and withdrawal. He is interpreting them as \"holding himself aloof\"\nfrom the Atonement.)",

    "content": "Healing as Release from Fear\n\nThe new emphasis will now be on healing. The miracle is the means, the\nAtonement the principle, and the healing is the result. Those who speak of “the\nmiracle OF healing” are combining two orders of reality inappropriately. Healing\nis NOT a miracle. The Atonement, or the final miracle, is a REMEDY. It is purely\na means, while any type of healing is a result.\n\nThe order of error to which Atonement is applied is irrelevant.\nEssentially, ALL healing is the release from fear. But to undertake this you\ncannot be fearful yourself.\n\nYou do not understand healing because of your own fear. I have been\nhinting throughout (and once stated very directly, because you were unfearful at\nthe time) that you MUST heal others. The reason is that their healing merely\nwitnesses or attests to yours.\n\nA major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at ALL levels.\nIllness, which is really “not Right Mindedness,” is the result of level confusion\nin the sense that it always entails the misbelief that what is amiss in one level\ncan adversely affect another.\n\nWe have constantly referred to miracles as the means of correcting\nlevel confusion. In reality, all mistakes must be corrected at the level at which\nthey occur. Only the mind is capable of error. The body can ACT erroneously, but\nthis is only because it has responded to mis-Thought. The body cannot create, and\nthe belief that it CAN, a fundamental error responsible for most of the fallacies\nalready referred to, produces all physical symptoms.\n\nAll physical illness represents a belief in magic. The whole\ndistortion which created magic rested on the belief that there is a creative\nability in matter, which can control the mind. This fallacy can work either way;\ni.e., it can be misbelieved either that the mind can miscreate IN the body, or\nthat the body can miscreate in the mind. If it can be made clear\nthat the mind, which is the only level of creation, cannot create beyond itself,\nthen neither confusion need occur.\n\nThe reason why only the mind can create is more obvious than may be\nimmediately apparent. The Soul has been created. The body is a learning device\nFOR the mind. Learning devices are not lessons in themselves. Their purpose is\nmerely to facilitate the THINKING of the learner. The most that a faulty use of a\nlearning device can do is to fail to facilitate. It does not have the power in\nitself to introduce actual learning errors.\n\nThe body, if properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the\nAtonement to two-edged application. This is not because the body is a miracle,\nbut because it is not inherently open to misinterpretation. The body is merely a\nfact. Its ABILITIES can be,99 and frequently are, overevaluated. However, it is\nalmost impossible to deny its existence. Those who do are engaging in a\nparticularly unworthy form of denial. (The use of the word “unworthy” here\nimplies simply that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful.\nThere is little doubt that the mind can miscreate. If one denies this\nunfortunate aspect of its power, one is also denying the power itself.)\n\nAll material means which man accepts as remedies for bodily ills are\nsimply restatements of magic principles. It was the first level of the error to\nbelieve that the body created its own illness. Thereafter, it is a second misstep\nto attempt to heal it through non-creative agents. It does not follow,\nhowever, that the application of these very weak corrective devices are evil.\nSometimes the illness has sufficiently great a hold over an individual's mind to\nrender him inaccessible to Atonement. In this case, one may be wise to utilize a\ncompromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the OUTSIDE is\ntemporarily given healing.\n\nThe value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is\nexpressed. In fact, if it is truly used it will inevitably BE expressed in\nwhatever way is most helpful to the receiver, not the giver. This means that a\nmiracle, to attain its full efficacy, MUST be expressed in a language which the\nrecipient can understand without fear. It does not follow by any means that this\nis the highest level of communication of which he is capable. But it DOES mean\nthat it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable NOW.\n\nThe whole aim of the miracle is to RAISE the level of communication,\nnot to impose regression (as improperly used) upon it. Before it is safe to let\nmiracle workers loose in this world, it is essential that they understand fully\nthe fear of release. Otherwise, they may unwittingly foster the misbelief that\nrelease is imprisonment, which is very prevalent. This misperception arose from\nthe attempted protection device (or misdefense) that harm can be limited to the\nbody. This was because of the much greater fear (which this one counteracts) that\nthe mind can hurt itself. Neither error is really meaningful, because the\nmiscreations of the mind do not really exist. That recognition is a far better\nprotection device than any form of level confusion, because of the advantages of\nintroducing correction at the level of the error.\n\nIt is essential that the remembrance of the fact that ONLY mind can\ncreate at all remain with you. Implicit in this is the corollary that correction\nbelongs at the thought level, and NOT at either level\nto which creation is inapplicable. To repeat an earlier statement, and also to\nextend it somewhat, the Soul is already perfect, and therefore does not require\ncorrection. The body does not really exist, except as a learning device for the\nmind. This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it was\ncreated, but is NOT creating.\nIt should be obvious, then, that correcting the creator (or inducing it to give\nup miscreation) is the only application of creation which is inherently\nmeaningful at all.\n\nWe said before that magic is essentially mindless, or the destructive\n(miscreated) use of mind. Physical medicines are a form of “spells.” In one way,\nthey are a more benign form, in that they do not entail the possession fallacy\nwhich DOES enter when a mind believes that it can possess another. Since this is\nconsiderably less dangerous, though still incorrect, it has its advantages. It is\nparticularly helpful to the therapist who really wants to heal, but is still\nfearful himself. By using physical means to do so, he is not engaging in any form\nof enslavement, even though he is not applying the Atonement. This means that his\nmind is dulled by fear, but is not actively engaged in distortion.\n\nThose who are afraid of using the mind to heal are right in avoiding\nit, because the very fact that they are afraid HAS made them vulnerable to\nmiscreation. They are therefore likely to misunderstand any healing they might\ninduce, and, because egocentricity and fear usually occur together, may be unable\nto accept the real Source of the healing. Under these conditions, it is safer for\nthem to rely TEMPORARILY on physical healing devices, because they cannot\nmisperceive them as their own creations. As long as their own vulnerability\npersists, it is essential to preserve them from even attempting miracles.\n\nWe said in a previous section that the miracle is an expression of\nmiracle-Mindedness. Miracle-Mindedness merely means Right-Mindedness in the sense\nthat we are now using it. Right-Mindedness neither exalts nor depreciates\nthe mind of the miracle worker nor of the miracle receiver. However, as a\ncreative act, the miracle need not await the Right-Mindedness of the receiver. In\nfact, its purpose is to restore him TO his Right Mind. But it is essential that\nthe miracle worker be in his Right Mind, or he will be unable to reestablish\nRight-Mindedness in someone else.\n\nThe healer who relies on his own readiness is endangering his\nunderstanding. He is perfectly safe as long as he is completely unconcerned about\nHIS readiness, but maintains a consistent trust in MINE. (Errors of this kind\nproduce some very erratic behavior, which usually point up an underlying\nunwillingness to co-operate. Note that by inserting the carbon backwards, B.\ncreated a situation in which two copies did not exist. This reflected two levels\nof confidence lack, one in My readiness to heal, and the other in his own\nwillingness to give.) These errors inevitably introduce inefficiency into the\nmiracle worker's behavior, and temporarily disrupt his miracle-mindedness. We\nmight also make very similar comments about your own hesitation about dictating\nat all. This is a larger error only because it results in greater inefficiency.\nIf you don't say anything, nobody can use it, including Me. We have established\nthat for all corrective processes, the first step is know that this is fear.\nUnless fear had entered, the corrective procedure would never have become\nnecessary. If your miracle working propensities are not working, it is always\nbecause fear has intruded on your Right-Mindedness, and has literally upset it\n(i.e. turned it upside down).\n\nAll forms of not-Right-Mindedness are the result of refusal to accept\nthe Atonement FOR YOURSELF. If the miracle worker DOES accept it, he places\nhimself in the position to recognize that those who need to be healed are simply\nthose who have NOT done so. The reason why you felt the vast radiation range of\nyour own inner illumination is because you were aware that your Right-Mindedness\nIS healing.\nThe sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept Atonement himself.\nThis means that he knows that mind is the only creative level, and that its\nerrors ARE healed by the Atonement. Once he accepts this, HIS mind can only heal.\nBy denying his mind any destructive potential, and reinstating its purely\nconstructive powers, he has placed himself in a position where he can undo the\nlevel confusion of others. The message which he then gives to others is the truth\nthat THEIR MINDS are really similarly constructive, and that their own\nmiscreations cannot hurt them. By affirming this, the miracle worker releases the\nmind from overevaluating its own learning device (the body), and restores the\nmind to its true position as the learner. It should be re-emphasized that the\nbody does not learn, any more than it creates. As a learning device, it merely\nfollows the learner, but if it is falsely endowed with self initiative, it\nbecomes a serious obstruction to the learning it should facilitate.\n\nONLY the mind is capable of illumination. The Soul is already\nilluminated, and the body in itself is too dense. The mind, however, can BRING\nits own illumination TO the body by recognizing that density is the opposite of\nintelligence, and therefore unamenable to independent learning. It is, however,\neasily brought into alignment with a mind which has learned to look beyond\ndensity toward light.\n\nCorrective learning always begins with awakening the spiritual eye,\nand turning away from belief in physical sight. The reason this entails fear is\nbecause man is afraid of what his spiritual eye will see, which was why he closed\nit in the first place. We said before that the spiritual eye cannot see error,\nand is capable only of looking beyond it to the defense of Atonement. There is no\ndoubt that the spiritual eye does produce extreme discomfort by what it sees. The\nthing that man forgets is that the discomfort\nis not the final outcome of its perception. When the spiritual eye is permitted\nto look upon the defilement of the altar, it also looks immediately toward\nAtonement. Nothing which the spiritual eye perceives can induce fear. Everything\nthat results from accurate spiritual awareness merely is channelized toward\ncorrection. Discomfort is aroused only to bring the need to correct forcibly into\nawareness.\n\nWhat the physical eye sees is not corrective, nor can it be corrected\nby any device which can be physically seen. As long as a man believes in what his\nphysical sight tells him, all his corrective behavior will be misdirected. The\nreason why the real vision is obscured is because man cannot endure to see his\nown defiled altar. But since the altar has BEEN defiled, this fact becomes doubly\ndangerous unless it IS perceived. This perception is totally non-threatening\nbecause of the Atonement. The fear of healing arises in the end from an\nunwillingness to accept the unequivocal fact that healing is necessary. The fear\narises because of the necessary willingness to look at what man has done to\nhimself.\n\nHealing was an ability which was lent to man after the Separation,\nbefore which it was completely unnecessary. Like all aspects of the space-time\nbelief, healing ability is temporary. However, as long as time persists, healing\nremains among the stronger human protections. This is because healing always\nrests on charity, and charity is a way of perceiving the true perfection of\nanother, even if he cannot perceive it himself. Most of the loftier concepts of\nwhich man is capable now are time-dependent. Charity is really a weaker\nreflection of a much more powerful love-encompassment, which is far beyond any\nform of charity that man can conceive of as yet. Charity is essential to Right-\nMindedness, in the limited sense to which Right-Mindedness can now be attained.\nCharity is a way of looking at another AS IF he had already gone far beyond his\nactual accomplishment in time. Since his own thinking is faulty, he cannot see\nthe Atonement himself, or he would have no need for charity at all. The charity\nwhich is accorded him is both an acknowledgment that he IS weak, and a\nrecognition that he COULD BE stronger. The way in which both of these beliefs are\nstated clearly implies their dependence on time, making it quite apparent that\ncharity lies within the framework of human\nlimitations, though toward the higher levels.\n\nT  C 22 We said before, twice in fact, that only Revelation transcends time. The\nmiracle, as an expression of true human charity, can only shorten it a best. It\nmust be understood, however, that whenever a man offers a miracle to another, he\nIS shortening the suffering of both. This introduces a correction into the\nRecord, which corrects retroactively as well as progressively.",

    "content": "Fear as Lack of Love\n\nYou and B. both believe that \"being afraid\" is involuntary. But I have\ntold you many times that only CONSTRUCTIVE acts should be involuntary. We said\nthat Christ-control can take over everything that DOESN'T matter, and Christguidance\ncan direct everything that DOES, if you so will.\n\nFear cannot be Christ-controlled, but it CAN be self-controlled. Fear\nis always associated with what does not matter. It prevents Me from controlling\nit. The correction is therefore a matter of YOUR will, because its presence shows\nthat you have raised the UNIMPORTANT to a higher level than it warrants. You have\nthus brought it under your will, where it DOES NOT belong. This means YOU feel\nresponsible for it. The level confusion here is perfectly obvious.\n\nThe reason that I cannot CONTROL fear for you is that you are\nattempting to raise to the mind level the proper content of the lower-order\nreality. I do NOT foster level confusion, but YOU can will to correct it.\n\nYou would not tolerate insane behavior on your part, and would hardly\nadvance the excuse that you could not help it. Why should you tolerate insane\nthinking? There is a fallacy here you would do well to look at clearly.\n\nYou both believe that you ARE responsible for what you DO, but NOT for\nwhat you THINK. The truth is that you ARE responsible for what you THINK, because\nit is only at this level that you CAN exercise choice. What you DO comes from\nwhat you think. You cannot separate the truth by giving autonomy to your\nbehavior. This is controlled by Me automatically, as soon as you place what you\nthink under my guidance.\n\nWhenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your\nmind to miscreate, i.e., have NOT allowed Me to guide it. It is pointless to\nbelieve that controlling the outcome of mis-Thought can result in real healing. When you are fearful, you have willed wrongly. This\nis why you feel you are responsible for it.\n\nYou must change your MIND, not your behavior, and this IS a matter of\nwill. You do not need guidance EXCEPT at the mind-level. Correction belongs ONLY\nat the level where creation is possible. The term does not really mean anything\nat the symptom-level, where it cannot work.\n\nThe correction of fear IS your responsibility. When you ask for\nrelease from fear, you are implying that it isn't. You should ask, instead, for\nhelp in the conditions which have brought the fear about. This condition always\nentails a separated Mind-willingness. At this level, you CAN help it.\n\nYou are much too tolerant of Mind-wandering, thus passively condoning\nits miscreation. The particular result never matters, but this fundamental error\nDOES. The fundamental correction is always the same. Before you will to do\nanything, ask Me if your will is in accord with Mine. If you are sure that it IS,\nthere will BE no fear.\n\nFear is always a sign of strain, which arises whenever the WILL to do\nconflicts with WHAT you do. This situation arises in two major ways:\n\n1) You can will to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively.\nThis produces conflicting behavior, which would be tolerable to the self (though\nnot necessarily to others) except for the fact that the part of the will that\nwants something ELSE is outraged.\n\n2)You can BEHAVE as you think you should, but without entirely WILLING to do so.\nThis produces consistent behavior, but entails great strain WITHIN the self.\n\nIf you think about it, you will realize that in both cases the will\nand the behavior are out-of-accord, resulting in a situation in which you are\ndoing what you do NOT will. This arouses a sense of coercion, which usually\nproduces rage. The anger then invades the mind, and projection in the wrong sense\nbecomes likely. Depression or anxiety are virtually certain.\n\nRemember that whenever there is fear, it is because YOU have NOT MADE\nUP YOUR MIND. Your will is split, and your behavior inevitably becomes erratic.\nCorrecting at the behavior level can shift the error from the first type to the\nsecond, but will NOT obliterate the fear.\n\nIt is possible to reach a state in which you bring your will under my\nguidance without much conscious effort, but this implies the kind of habit\npattern which neither you nor B. has developed dependably as yet.\n\nTell B. that although he keeps telling you that God will never ask you\nto do more than you can, he does not understand it himself. God CANNOT ask more\nthan you WILL. The strength to DO comes from your own undivided will to do. There\nis NO strain in doing God's will as soon as it is also your own.\n\nThe lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be\noverlooked. I will therefore repeat it, URGING you to listen. Only your mind can\nproduce fear. It does so whenever it is conflicted in what it wills, thus",

    "content": "The Correction for Lack of Love\n\nAfter taking the first corrective step, i.e., \"Knowing it IS fear,\"\nyou might benefit temporarily by adding another next step BEFORE going on with\nthe corrective process. Try saying to yourself that you MUST have willed not to\nlove somehow or somewhere, or that fear which arises from behavior-will conflict\ncould not have happened. Then follow previous instructions.\n\nIf you consider what the process really means, it is nothing more than\na series of pragmatic steps in the larger process of accepting the Atonement as\nTHE remedy. From this viewpoint, the steps can be reworded as follows:\n\n1.) Know first this is fear.\n\n2.) Fear arises from lack of love.\n\n3.) The ONLY remedy for lack of love is perfect love.\n\n4.) Perfect love IS the Atonement.\n\nThe final procedural step () is inherent in the last statement (4).\nWe have emphasized that the miracle, or the EXPRESSION of Atonement, is always a\nsign of real respect from the worthy TO the worthy. This worth IS re-established\nby the Atonement.\n\nIt is obvious, then, that when you are afraid you have placed yourself\nin a position where you NEED Atonement BECAUSE you have DONE something loveless\nbecause you WILLED without love. This is precisely the situation for which the\nAtonement was offered. The need for the remedy inspired its CREATION.\n\nAs long as you recognize only the NEED for the remedy, you will remain\nfearful. However, as soon as you REMEDY it, you have also abolished the fear.\nThis is how TRUE healing occurs.\n\nEveryone experiences fear, and nobody enjoys it. Yet, it would take\nvery little Right-thinking to know why it occurs. Neither you nor B. have thought\nabout it very much, either. ( I object at this point to the use of plural verb\nwith a properly singular subject - - HS - - and remember that last time in a very\nsimilar sentence, He said it correctly and I remembered it with real pleasure.\nThis real grammatical error makes me suspicious of the genuineness of these\nnotes. ANSWER: What it really shows is that YOU are not very receptive. The\nreason it came out that way, is because you are projecting (in the inappropriate\nway) your own anger, which has nothing to do with these notes. YOU made the\nerror, because you are not feeling loving, so you want me to sound silly, so you\nwon't have to pay attention. Actually, I am trying to get through against\nconsiderable opposition, because you are not very happy, and I wish you were. I\nthought I'd take a chance, even though you are so resistant, because I MIGHT be\nable to make you feel better. You may be unable not to attack at all, but do try\nto listen a little, too.)\n\nVery few people appreciate the real power of the mind. Nobody remains\nfully aware of it all the time. This is inevitable in this world, because the\nhuman being has many things he must do, and cannot engage in constant thoughtwatching.\nHowever, if he hopes to spare himself from fear, there are some things\nhe must realize, and realize them fully, at least some of the time.\n\nThe mind is a very powerful creator, and it never loses its creative\nforce. It never sleeps. Every instant it is creating, and ALWAYS as you will.\nMany of your ordinary expressions reflect this. For example, when you say \"don't\ngive it a thought,” you are implying that if you do not think about something, it\nwill have no effect on you. This is true enough.\n\nOn the other hand, many other expressions are clear expressions of the\nprevailing LACK of awareness of thought-power. For example, you say, \"just an\nidle thought,” and mean that the thought has no effect. You also speak of some\nactions as \"thoughtless,” implying that if the person HAD thought, he would not\nhave behaved as he did. You also use phrases like \"thought provoking,” which is\nbland enough, but the term \"a provoking thought\" means something quite different.\n\nWhile expressions like \"think big\" give some recognition to the power\nof thought, they still come nowhere near the truth. You do not expect to grow\nwhen you say it, because you don't really believe it. It is hard to recognize\nthat thought and belief combine into a power-surge that can literally move\nmountains.\n\nIt appears at first glance that to believe such power about yourself\nis merely arrogant, but that is not the real reason why you don't believe it.\n\nPeople prefer to believe that their thoughts cannot exert real control\nbecause they are literally AFRAID of them. Therapists try to help people who are\nafraid of their own death wishes by depreciating the power of the wish. They even\nattempt to \"free\" the patient by persuading him that he can think whatever he\nwants, without ANY real effect at all.\n\nThere is a real dilemma here, which only the truly right-minded can\nescape. Death wishes do not kill in the physical sense, but they DO kill\nspiritually. ALL destructive thinking is dangerous. Given a death wish, a man has\nno choice except to ACT upon his thought, or behave CONTRARY TO it. He can thus\nchoose ONLY between homicide and fear. (See previous notes on will conflicts.)\n(NOTE I avoided this term in the last series of notes intentionally, because it\nseemed too Rankian. Apparently, there was a reason why this word should have been\nused last time. It is used in this section for a very good reason.)\n\nThe other possibility is that he depreciates the power of his thought.\nThis is the usual psychoanalytic approach. This DOES allay guilt, but at the cost\nof rendering thinking impotent. If you believe that what you think is\nineffectual, you may cease to be overly afraid of it, but you are hardly likely\nto respect it, either. The world is full of endless examples of how man has\ndepreciated himself because he is afraid of his own thoughts. In some forms of\ninsanity, thoughts are glorified, but this is only because the underlying\ndepreciation was too effective for tolerance.\n\nThe truth is that there ARE no \"idle thoughts.” ALL thinking produces\nform at some level. The reason why people are afraid of ESP, and so often react\nagainst it, is because they KNOW that thought can hurt them. Their OWN thoughts\nhave made them vulnerable.\n\nYou and B., who complain all the time about fear, still persist in\ncreating it most of the time. I told you last time that you cannot ask ME to\nrelease you from it, because I KNOW it does not exist. YOU don't. If I merely\nintervene between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a\nbasic law of cause and effect, in fact the most fundamental one there is in this\nworld.\nI would hardly help if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. This would\nbe in direct opposition to the purpose of this course.\n\nIt is certainly much more useful to remind you that you do not guard\nyour thoughts at all carefully, except for a relatively small part of the day,\nand somewhat inconsistently even then. You may feel at this point that it would\ntake a miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true. Human beings\nare not used to miraculous thinking, but they CAN be TRAINED to think that way.\n\nAll miracle-workers HAVE to be trained that way. I have to be able to\ncount on them. This means that I cannot allow them to leave their mind unguarded,\nor they will not be able to help me. Miracle-working entails a full realization\nof the power of thought, and real avoidance of miscreation. Otherwise, the\nmiracle will be necessary to set the mind ITSELF straight, a circular process\nwhich would hardly foster the time-collapse for which the miracle was intended.\nNor would it induce the healthy respect that every miracle-worker must have for\ntrue cause and effect.\n\nMiracles cannot free the miracle-worker from fear. Both miracles AND\nfear come from his thoughts, and if he were not free to choose one, he would also\nnot be free to choose the other. Remember, we said before that when electing one\nperson, you reject another.\n\nIt is much the same in electing the miracle. By so doing, you HAVE\nrejected fear. Fear cannot assail unless it has been created. You and B. have\nbeen afraid of God, of me, of yourselves, and of practically everyone you know at\none time or another.\nThis can only be because you have miscreated all of us, and believe in what you\nhave created. (We spent a lot of time on this before, but it did not help very\nmuch.) You would never have done this if you were not afraid of your own\nthoughts. The vulnerable are essentially miscreators, because they misperceive\nCreation.\n\nYou and B. are willing to accept primarily what does NOT change your\nminds too much, and leaves you free to leave them quite unguarded most of the\ntime. You persist in believing that when you do not consciously watch your mind,\nit is unmindful.\n\nIt is time to consider the whole world of the unconscious, or\nunwatched mind. This will frighten you, because it is the source of fright. You\nmay look at it as a new theory of basic conflict, if you wish, which will not be\nentirely an intellectual approach, because I doubt if the truth will escape you\nentirely.\n\nThe unwatched mind is responsible for the whole content of the\nunconscious, which lies above the miracle-level. All psychoanalytic theorists\nhave made some contribution to the truth in this connection, but none of them has\nseen it in its true entirety. (The correct grammar here is a sign of your better\ncooperation. Thank you.) Jung's best contribution was an awareness of individual\nvs. collective unconscious levels. He also recognized the major place of the\nreligious spirit in his schema. His archetypes were also meaningful concepts. But\nhis major error lay in regarding the deepest level of the unconscious as shared\nin terms of CONTENT. The deepest level of the unconscious is shared as an\nABILITY. As MIRACLE-MINDEDNESS, the content, (or the particular miracles which an\nindividual happens to perform) does not matter at all.\nThey will, in fact, be entirely different, because, since I direct them, I make a\npoint of avoiding redundancy. Unless a miracle actually heals, it is not a\nmiracle at all.\n\nThe content of the miracle-level is not recorded in the individual's\nunconscious, because if it were, it would not be automatic and involuntary, which\nwe have said repeatedly it should be. However, the content IS a matter for the\nrecord, which is NOT within the individual himself.\n\nAll psychoanalysts made one common error, in that they attempted to\nuncover unconscious CONTENT. You cannot understand unconscious activity in these\nterms, because \"content\" is applicable ONLY to the more superficial unconscious\nlevels to which the individual himself contributes. This is the level at which he\ncan readily introduce fear, and usually does.\n\nFreud was right in calling this level pre-conscious, and emphasizing\nthat there is a fairly easy interchange between preconscious and conscious\nmaterial. He was also right in regarding the censor as an agent for the\nprotection of consciousness from fear. HIS major error lay in his insistence that\nthis level is necessary at all in the psychic structure. If the psyche contains\nfearful levels from which it cannot escape without splitting, its integration is\npermanently threatened. It is essential not to control the fearful, but to\nELIMINATE it.\n\nHere, Rank's concept of the will was particularly good, except that he\npreferred to ally it only with man's own truly creative ability, but did not\nextend it to its proper union with God's. His \"birth trauma,” another valid idea,\nwas also too limited, in that it did not refer to the Separation, which was\nreally a FALSE idea of birth. Physical birth is not\na trauma in itself. It can, however, remind the individual of the Separation,\nwhich was a very real cause of fear.\n\nThe idea of \"will-THERAPY\" was potentially a very powerful one, but\nRank did not see its real potential because he himself used his mind partly to\ncreate a theory OF the mind, but also partly to attack Freud. His reactions to\nFreud stemmed from his own unfortunate acceptance of the deprivation-fallacy,\nwhich itself arose from the Separation. This led him to believe that his own\nmind-creation could stand only if the creation of another's fell. In consequence,\nhis theory emphasized rather than minimized the two-edged nature of defenses.\nThis is an outstanding characteristic of his concepts, because it was\noutstandingly true of him.\n\nHe also misinterpreted the birth-trauma in a way that made it\ninevitable for him to attempt a therapy whose goal was to ABOLISH FEAR. This is\ncharacteristic of all later theorists, who do not attempt, as Freud did, to split\noff the fear in his own form of therapy.\n\nNo one as yet has fully recognized either the therapeutic value of\nfear, or the only way in which it can be truly ended. When man miscreates, he IS\nin pain. The cause and effect principle here is temporarily a real expeditor.\nActually, Cause is a term properly belonging to God, and Effect, which should\nalso be capitalized, is HIS Sonship. This entails a set of cause and effect\nrelationships which are totally different from those which man introduced into\nthe Miscreation.\nNOV. \n\nThe fundamental opponents in the real basic conflict are Creation and\nmiscreation. All fear is implicit in the second, just as all love is inherent in\nthe first. Because of this difference, the basic conflict IS one between love and\nfear.\n\nSo much, then, for the true nature of the major opponents in the basic\nconflict. Since all such theories lead to a form of therapy in which a redistribution\nof psychic energy results, it is necessary to consider OUR concept\nof libido next. In this respect, Freud was more accurate than his followers, who\nwere essentially more wishful. Energy CAN emanate from both Creation AND\nmiscreation, and the particular ratio which prevails between them at a given\npoint in time DOES determine behavior AT that time. If miscreation did NOT\nengender energy in its own right, it would be unable to produce destructive\nbehavior, which it very patently DOES.\n\nEverything that man creates has energy because, like the Creation of\nGod, they (it) come FROM energy, and are endowed by their creator with the power\nto create. Miscreation is still a genuine creative act in terms of the underlying\nIMPULSE, but NOT in terms of the CONTENT of the creation. This, however, does not\ndeprive the creation of its OWN creative power. It DOES, however, GUARANTEE that\nthe power will be misused, or USED FEARFULLY.\n\nTo deny this is merely the previously mentioned fallacy of\ndepreciation. Although Freud made a number of fallacies of his own, he DID avoid\nthis one in connection with libido. The later theorists denied the split-energy\nconcept, not by attempting to heal it, but by re-interpreting it instead of\nredistributing it.\n\nThis placed them in the illogical position of assuming that the split\nwhich their therapies were intended to heal had not occurred. The result of this\napproach is essentially a form of hypnosis. This is quite different from Freud's\napproach, which merely ended in a deadlock.\n\nA similar deadlock occurs when both the power of Creation and of\nmiscreation coexist. This is experienced as conflict only because the individual\nfeels AS IF both were occurring AT THE SAME LEVEL. He BELIEVES in what he has\ncreated in his own unconscious and he naturally believes it is real BECAUSE he\nhas created it. He, thus, places himself in a position where the fearful becomes\nREAL.\n\nNothing but level-confusion can result as long as this belief is held\nin ANY form. Inappropriate denial and equally inappropriate identification of the\nREAL factors in the basic conflict will NOT solve the problem itself. The\nconflict CANNOT disappear until it is fully recognized that miscreation is NOT\nreal, and therefore there IS no conflict. This entails a full realization of the\nbasic fact that, although man has miscreated in a very real sense, he need\nneither continue to do so, nor to suffer from his past errors in this respect.\n\nA REDISTRIBUTION of psychic energy, then, is NOT the solution. Both\nthe idea that both kinds MUST exist, and the belief that ONE kind is amenable for\nuse or misuse, are real distortions. The ONLY way is to STOP MISCREATING NOW, and\naccept the Atonement for miscreations of the past.\nOnly this can re-establish true single-mindedness. The structure of the psyche,\nas you very correctly noted yourself, follows along the lines of the particular\nlibido concept the theorist employs. (I still think it was the other way around \\-\n\\- HS. Answer: This confusion arises out of the fact that you DID change the order\n\\- \\- several times in fact. Actually, it didn't matter, because the two concepts\nDO flow from each other. It was a TERRIFIC waste of time, and one in which I\nhardly care to become engaged myself. PLEASE!)\n\nFreud's psyche was essentially a good and evil picture, with very\nheavy weight given to the evil. This is because every time I mentioned the\nAtonement to him, which was quite often, he responded by defending his theory\nmore and more against it. This resulted in his increasingly strong attempts to\nmake the illogical sound more and more logical.\n\nI was very sorry about this, because his was a singularly good mind,\nand it was a shame to waste it. However, the major purpose of his incarnation was\nnot neglected. He DID succeed in forcing recognition of the unconscious into\nman's calculations about himself, a step in the right direction which should not\nbe minimized. Freud was one of the most religious men I have known recently.\nUnfortunately, he was so afraid of religion that the only way he could deal with\nit was to regard IT (not himself) as sick. This naturally prevented healing.\n\nFreud's superego is a particularly interesting example of the real\npower of miscreation. It is noteworthy throughout the whole development of his\ntheories that the superego never allied itself with freedom. The most it could do\nin this direction was to\nwork out a painful truce in which both opponents LOST. This perception could not\nfail to force him to emphasize discontent in his view of civilization.\n\nThe Freudian id is really only the more superficial level of the\nunconscious, and not the deepest level at all. This, too, was inevitable, because\nFreud could not divorce miracles from magic. It was therefore his constant\nendeavor, (even preoccupation) to keep on thrusting more and more material\nbetween consciousness and the real deeper level of the unconscious, so that the\nlatter became increasingly obscured. The result was a kind of bedlam, in which\nthere was no order, no control, and no sense. This was exactly how he FELT about\nit.\n\nThe later theoretical switch to the primacy of anxiety was an\ninteresting device intended to deny both the instinctive nature of\ndestructiveness, and the force of the power of miscreation. By placing the\nemphasis on the RESULT, the generative nature of the power was minimized.\n\nDestructive behavior IS instinctual. The instinct for creation is NOT\nobliterated in miscreation. That is why it is always invested with reality. \\*One\nof the chief ways in which man can correct his magic-miracle confusion is to\nremember that he did not create himself. He is apt to forget this when he becomes\negocentric, and this places him in a position where belief in magic is virtually\ninevitable. His instincts for creation were given him by his own Creator, who was\nexpressing the same instinct in His Creation. Since the creative ability rests\nsolely in the mind, everything which man creates is necessarily instinctive.\n\n\n(This goes after basic conflict theory.) (Dictated without notes by\nHS)\n\nWe have already said that the basic conflict is one between love and\nfear, and that the proper organization of the psyche rests on a lack of level\nconfusion. The section on psychic energy should be re-read very carefully,\nbecause it is particularly likely to be misinterpreted until this section is\ncomplete.\n\nIt has already been said that man CANNOT control fear, because he\nhimself created it. His belief in it renders it out of his control by definition.\nFor this reason, any attempt to resolve the basic conflict through the concept\nof mastery of fear is meaningless. In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the\nsimple assumption that it need be mastered at all.\n\nThe essential resolution rests entirely on the mastery of love. In the\ninterim, conflict is inevitable. The reason for this is the strangely illogical\nposition in which man had placed himself. Since we have frequently emphasized\nthat correction must be applied within the level that error occurs, it should be\nclear that the miracle MUST be illogical because its purpose is to correct the\nillogical and restore order.\n\nTwo concepts which CANNOT coexist are nothing and everything. To\nwhatever extent one is believed in, the other HAS BEEN abolished. In the\nconflict, fear is really nothing, and love is really everything. (This\nrecognition is really the basis for the castration complex.) This is because\nwhenever light penetrates darkness, it DOES abolish it. The unwillingness to be\nseen, or submit error to light, is spuriously associated with active doing. In\nthis incarnation, this can take the form of oedipal involvement and concomitant\ncastration anxiety.\n\nHowever, in more long range and meaningful terms, the oedipal complex\nis a miniature of the true Separation fear, and the castration complex is a way\nof denying that it ever occurred. Like all pseudo-solutions, this kind of\ndistorted thinking is very creative, but false. The Separation HAS occurred. To\ndeny this is merely to misuse denial. However, to concentrate on error is merely\na further misuse of legitimate psychic mechanisms. The true corrective procedure,\nwhich has already been described as the proper use of the spiritual eye (or true\nvision), is to accept the error temporarily, BUT ONLY as an indication that\nIMMEDIATE correction is mandatory. This establishes a state of mind in which the\nAtonement can be accepted without delay.\n\nIt is worth repeating that ultimately there is no compromise possible\nbetween everything and nothing. The purpose of time is essentially a device by\nwhich all compromise in this respect can be abolished. It seems to be abolished\nby degrees precisely because time itself involves a concept of intervals which\ndo not really exist. The faulty use of creation has made this necessary as a\ncorrective device.\n\n\"And God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son so that\nwhosoever believeth on Him shall not perish but have Eternal Life\" needs only\none slight correction to be entirely meaningful in this context. It should read\n\"And God so loved the world that he gave it TO His only begotten Son.\" It should\nbe noted that God HAS begotten only ONE Son.\n\nThe concept of minus numbers has always been regarded as a\nmathematical rather than an actual expedient. (This is a major limitation on\nmathematics as presently understood.) Any statement which implies degrees of\ndifference in negation is essentially meaningless. What can replace this negative\napproach is a recognition of the fact that as long as one part (which is the same\nas a million or ten or eight thousand parts) of the Sonship is missing, it is NOT\ncomplete.\n\nIn the Divine psyche, the Father and the Holy Spirit are not\nincomplete at all. The Sonship has the unique faculty of believing in error, or\nincompleteness, if he so elects. However, it is quite apparent that so to elect\nIS to believe in the existence of nothingness. The correction of this error\nis the Atonement.\n\nWe have already briefly spoken about readiness. But there are some\nadditional awarenesses which might be helpful. Readiness is nothing more than the\nprerequisite for accomplishment. The two should not be confused. As soon as a\nstate of readiness occurs, there is always some will to accomplish, but this is\nby no means undivided. The state does not imply more than the potential for a\nshift of will. Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been\naccomplished. We began this section with an attempt to correct the fundamental\nhuman error that fear can be mastered. The Correction was that ONLY love can be\nmastered. When I told you that you were \"ready for Revelation,” I did not mean\nthat you had in any way mastered this form of communication. However, you\nyourself attested to your readiness by insisting that I would not have said so if\nit had not been true. This IS an affirmation of readiness. Mastery of love\nnecessarily involves a much more complete confidence in the ability than either\nof you has attained. But the readiness at least is an indication that you believe\nthis is possible. This is only the beginning of confidence.\n\nIn case this be misunderstood as a statement that an enormous amount\nof time will be necessary between readiness and mastery, I would again remind you\nthat time and space are under My control.\n(Dictated without notes by HS)\n\nOne of the chief ways in which man can correct his magic-miracle\nconfusion is to remember that he did not create himself. He is apt to forget this\nwhen he becomes egocentric, and this places him in a position where belief in\nmagic is virtually inevitable. His instincts for creation were given him by his\nown Creator, who was expressing the same instinct in His Creation. Since the\ncreative ability rests solely in the mind, everything which man creates is\nnecessarily instinctive.\n\nIt also follows that whatever he creates is real in his own eyes, but\nnot necessarily in the sight of God. This basic distinction leads us directly\ninto the real meaning of the Last Judgment. (I am aware of the fact that you\nwould much rather continue with the parallels involved in other theories of basic\nconflict. However, this would merely be a delay which we will engage in only if\nyou regard it as essential.)",

    "content": "The Meaning of the Last Judgment\n\nThe Final Judgment is one of the greatest threat concepts in man's\nperception. This is only because he does not understand it. Judgment is not an\nessential attribute of God. Man brought judgment into being only because of the\nSeparation. God Himself is still the God of mercy. After the Separation, however,\nthere WAS a place for justice in the schema, because it was one of the many\nlearning devices which had to be built into the overall plan. Just as the\nSeparation occurred over many millions of years, the Last Judgment will extend\nover a similarly long period, and perhaps even longer. Its length depends,\nhowever, on the effectiveness of the present speed-up. We have frequently noted\nthat the miracle is a device for shortening but not abolishing time. If a\nsufficient number of people become truly miracle-minded quickly, the shortening\nprocess can be almost immeasurable. But it is essential that these individuals\nfree themselves from fear sooner than would ordinarily be the case, because they\nMUST emerge from basic conflict if they are to bring peace to the minds of\nothers.\n\nThe Last Judgment is generally thought of as a procedure undertaken by\nGod. Actually, it will be undertaken solely by man, with My help. It is a Final\nHealing, rather than a meting out of punishment, however much man may think\npunishment is deserved. Punishment as a concept is in total opposition to Right-\nMindedness. The aim of the Final Judgment is to RESTORE Right-Mindedness TO man.\n\nThe Final Judgment might be called a process of Right-evaluation. It\nsimply means that finally all men must come to understand what is worthy and what\nis not. After this, their ability to choose can be reasonably directed. Unless\nthis distinction has been made, the vacillations between free and imprisoned will\ncannot but continue. The first step toward freedom, then, MUST entail a sorting\nout of the false from the true. This is a process of division only in the\nconstructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse. Man will\nultimately look upon his own creations, and will to preserve only what is good,\njust as God Himself once looked upon what he had created, and knew that it WAS\ngood. At this point, the Will will begin to look with love on its creations,\nbecause of their great worthiness. The mind will inevitably disown its\nmiscreations, and having withdrawn belief from them, they will no longer exist.\n\nThe term Last Judgment is frightening, not only because it has been\nfalsely projected onto God, but also because of the association of \"Last\" with\ndeath. This is an outstanding example of upside down perception. Actually, if it\nis examined objectively, it is quite apparent that it is really the doorway to\nlife. No man who lives in fear is really alive.\n\nHis own final judgment cannot be directed toward himself, because he\nis not his own creation. He can apply it meaningfully, and at any time, to\neverything he has ever created, and retain in his real memory only what is good.\nThis is what his own Right-Mindedness CANNOT BUT dictate. The purpose of time is\nsolely to \"give him time\" to achieve this judgment. It is his own perfect\njudgment of his own creation. When everything that he retains is lovable, there\nis no reason for any fear to remain in him. This IS his part in the Atonement.",

YOU do not think of the notes in this way at\nall. B DOES from time to time, but he generally says, “It's probably in the\nnotes,” and DOESN'T look it up. He believes that, although he reads them over,\nthey cannot REALLY help him until they are complete.\n\nFirst of all, he cannot be sure of this unless he tries. Second, they\nwould BE completed if both of you so willed.\n\nYou vaguely know that the course is intended for some sort of\npreparation. I can only say that you are not prepared.\n\nI was amused when you reminded B. that he, too, was being prepared for\nsomething quite unexpected, and he said, he was not at all curious about what it\nwas. This disinterest is very characteristic of him when he is afraid. Interest\nand fear do NOT go together, as your respective behavior clearly shows.\n\nMental retardation is a defense which, like the others EXCEPT the\nAtonement, can be used on behalf of error or truth, as elected. When it occurs in\nREALITY, it is a temporary device, agreed on beforehand, to check the miscreative\nabilities of strong but misdirected wills.\n\nIt is necessary that this appropriate use of the defense BE considered\nreal, because otherwise it cannot serve. The lesson involves not only the\nindividual himself, but also his parents, siblings, and all of those who come in\nclose relation with him.\nThe VALUE of the experience depends on the need of each particular learner. The\nperson himself is a POOR learner, by definition, only as a step toward changing\nfrom a bad to a good one.\n\nMental retardation can also be used as a maladaptive defense, if the\nwrong (or attack) side is employed. This produces the “pseudo-retardation\nsyndrome” which is justly classified as a psychiatric (or disturbed-level)\nsymptom. Both of you do this all the time. B. acts as if he does not understand\neven his OWN special language, let alone mine, and you cannot read at all.\n\nThis represents a joint attack on both yourselves AND me, because it\nrenders YOUR mind weak, and mine incompetent. Remember, this puts you in a truly\nfearful position. If you cannot understand either your own mind OR mine, you do\nnot KNOW what is really willed. It is thus IMPOSSIBLE to avoid conflict, as\ndefined before, because even if you act ACCORDING TO will, you wouldn't know it.\n\nThe next part of this course rests too heavily on the earlier part not\nto REQUIRE its study. Without this, you will become much too fearful when the\nunexpected DOES occur to make constructive use of it. However, as you study the\nnotes, you will see some of the obvious implications, unless you still persist in\nmisusing the defense of mental retardation. Please remember that its constructive\nuse, described above, is hardly a REAL part of your own REAL proper equipment. It\nis a PARTICULARLY inappropriate defense as you use it, and I can only urge you\nto avoid it.\n\nThe reason why a solid foundation is necessary at this point is\nbecause of the highly likely confusion of “fearful” and “awesome,” which most\npeople do make. You will remember that we said once before that awe is\ninappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not\nexperience awe in the presence of your own equals.\n\nSo far, this course has had only indirect recourse to God, and rarely\neven refers to Him directly. I have repeatedly emphasized that awe is not\nappropriate in connection with me, BECAUSE of our inherent equality. I have been\ncareful to clarify my own role in the Atonement, without either over or\nunderstating it. I have tried to do exactly the same things in connection with\nyours.\n\nThe next step, however, DOES involve the direct approach to God\nHimself. It would be most unwise to start on this step at all without very\ncareful preparation, or awe will surely be confused with fear, and the experience\nwill be more traumatic than beatific.\n\nHealing is of God in the end. The means are carefully explained in the\nnotes. Revelation has occasionally SHOWN you the end, but to reach it the means\nare needed.\n\n(The following Introduction dictated by HS without notes.)\nThe following is the only detailed description which need be written down as to\nhow error interferes with preparation. The events specifically referred to here\ncould be any events, nor does their particular influence matter. It is the\nprocess which is to be noted here, and not its results. The kind of beliefs, and\nthe fallacious premises involved in misthought are as well exemplified here as\nelsewhere. There is nothing of special interest about the events described below,\nEXCEPT their typical nature. If this is a true course in mind-training, then the\nwhole value of this section rests ONLY in showing you what NOT to do. The more\nconstructive emphasis is, of course, on the positive approach. Mind-watching\nwould have prevented any of this from occurring, and will do so any time you\npermit it to.\n\n(Following is from notes) Tell B. that the reason why he was so\nstrained yesterday is because he allowed himself a number of fear-producing\nattitudes. They were fleeting enough to be more will-of-the-wisps than serious\nwill-errors, but unless he watches this kind of thing, he WILL find the notes\nfearful, and, knowing him well, will mis-distantiate. His unprovoked irritation\nwas unpardonable EXCEPT by himself, and he did not choose to pardon it. YOU did,\nbut I am afraid you were under some strain in doing so. This was unfortunate, and\nweakened your own ability to behave healingly toward B. at the time, and later\nalso toward Louis, both of whom DID act stupidly. But one stupidity at a time is\nusually enough. You are getting too close to the misuse of mental retardation\nwhen stupidity sets in all around.\n\nB., having already weakened himself, was very un-miracle-minded, first\nby not asking Dora if she wanted a lift in the cab, which was going her way. Even\nif she didn't want it, she would have been able to use the thought well. There is\nprobably no human error that is\nmore fear-provoking (in the will/behavior conflict sense) than countering any\nform of error with error. The result can be highly inflammable. By reacting to\nDora's stupidity with his own, all of the elements which are virtually certain to\nengender fear have been provided.\n\nB should note that this is one of the few times that he had to wait\nfor a cab. He thought he took care of it by holding the door of a cab which did\ncome for that lady, but he was misguided in this belief. Beliefs are THOUGHTS,\nand thus come under Christ-guidance, NOT control. Actually, by giving this cab to\nher, he was very unkind to you. It was quite apparent that you were extremely\ncold, and also very late. The idea that giving her the cab would atone for his\nprevious errors was singularly out of place, and well calculated to lead to\nfurther error. If, instead of attempting to atone on his own, he had asked for\nguidance, there would have been no difficulty whatever in the cab situation. It\nwas not necessary that anyone wait at all.\n\nB's original slight to Dora, because of his own need to get home as he\nperceived it, stopped him from benefiting from the time-saving device of the\nmiracle. He would have gotten home MUCH quicker if he had taken time to use time\nproperly.\n\nYOU were still suffering from strain (see above), and got quite\nirritated at the girl who stood next to the door on the side which blocked its\nopening. Her presence there made it necessary each time the door was opened to\nhold it for a much longer time than was necessary, and you were angry because\nthis made you cold. Actually, the girl was taking care of the younger child who\nwas standing outside, and both of them were really mentally retarded. If you will\nremember, the older girl asked you very uncertainly about the bus, and you were\nwell aware at the time of her extreme uncertainty.\n\nIt would have been much wiser had you built up her confidence, instead\nof associating with her stupidity. This reduced your own efficiency, and the only\nthing that saved you then was that you DID remember, in the cab, to ask me about\nthe notes, instead of assuming that you were necessarily to arrange to meet the\nnext day and go over them. B. had already become so misguided that it did not\noccur to him that his own will, (which he justified by the contents of the recent\nnotes —a misuse of truth only seemingly on its own behalf) might be questionable.\n(You took poor notes yourself here, because you got mad at him on remembering\nthis. While you did try to will right in the cab, you did not quite succeed. The\nerror is showing up now.)\n\nB thus placed himself in a condition to experience a fear rather than\na love reaction. (HS notes that she was going to write “an excellent position,”\nbut did not do so. Answer: You were right about the misuse of “excellent” here,\nand please do cross it out. You are STILL angry. An excellent position for\nmiscreation is not a meaningful approach to the problem.)\n\nIt was indeed discourteous (“indeed” is not necessary; it was your\nOWN error here; I am NOT saying this with any harsh overtones at all. I am just\ntrying to create better learning conditions for the study periods. We want as\nlittle interference as possible, for VERY good reasons.)\n\nNow, go back to B; he WAS discourteous when he told you that HE wanted\nto keep the original copy of the notes, having decided to have them Xeroxed on\nhis OWN will, and then justifying it by a very slight misinterpretation of what I\nsaid about “useful for others.” In fact, if he will re-read the actual quote, he\nwill see that it REALLY means “useful for HIM.” YOU had interpreted it that way,\nand frankly this was pretty clear to me at the time.\nBut this sort of thing happens all the time. It should, be noted, however, that\nthe result was not only considerable and totally unnecessary planning on B's\npart, but also a failure to utilize what WAS intended for him as a help for\nHIMSELF. And before YOU get too self-satisfied, I would remind you that you do it\nall the time, too.\n\nB. acted inappropriately toward YOU, by saying that he wanted to be\nSURE that the original was not lost or dirty. It is noticeable that, having\nalready decided what HE wanted to do, it never occurred to him that it IS\npossible that HE might lose or dirty them himself, especially as he had not\nentrusted them to me. This is a form of arrogance that he would be much happier\nwithout. He should also note that this would probably not have occurred had he\nnot been ALREADY literally “off the beam.” Be SURE to tell him that this pun is\nto reassure him that I am not angry. If he does not get it, or does not like it,\nI KNOW it is not very good. The reason is that HE put me in a position where I\ncan really give him very little at the moment.\n\nBut I want him to know that I am VERY well aware of the exceedingly\nfew times he now makes errors of this kind. He has come a VERY long way in this\nrespect. It seems a shame that he should allow himself even this much discomfort\nfrom it.\n\nI suggest to YOU that we pray for him, and I pray for your full\ncooperation in this. This will correct YOUR errors, and help him react better to\nthe work on the bookcase, which may otherwise lend itself for misuse by\nmisprojection. There would have been no problem at all about the bookcase, and\nperhaps even no bookcase, if the solution of the storage problem had been left to\nme. I have promised to guide you OUT of problems, and will certainly not create\nthem for you. But this means that you do not undertake to solve them yourselves.\nA storage problem is hardly more difficult for me to solve that a space problem,\n(see comments under special principles for miracle workers.)\n\nYou started well in your attempt to pray with me for B., but ended\nbadly. This is because you had already made a number of earlier errors. You were\nwrong to be pleased with Bill F's criticism of Rose, and should not have enjoyed\nBill F's description of Zanvil's caricaturing of her. You could have laughed WITH\nBill, but NOT AT Rose. Real courtesy NEVER does this. You should know that all\nGod's children are fully worthy of COMPLETE courtesy. You should NEVER join with\none at the EXPENSE of another.\n\nWhen you called B about joining you, Gene, and Anne at lunch, YOU\nshould have waited to ask ME. In fact, you should not even have told Anne that\nyou would call. Then you could have asked B. FIRST if HE would want to come, and\ncalled ANNE back. It is true that it was better that he came, but this has\nnothing to do with the real issue. There are ways of treating others in which\nONLY consistent courtesy, even in very little things, is offered. This is a VERY\nHEALING habit to acquire.\n\nB's answer to your call was a clear statement of his own sadly\nconflicted state. He said, “I don't want to join you, but that's ungracious, so\nI'll go.” Whenever ANY invitation to join others in a gracious way is offered, it\nshould ALWAYS be met with respect, although it need not always be accepted.\nHowever, if it is MET ungraciously the resulting feeling may well be one of\ncoercion. This is ALWAYS a split-will reaction.\n\nB. did not solve this by ACTING graciously. The lunch need not have\nentailed either mental or physical strain for him, and no “need to escape” should\nhave arisen. This was a regression of the unprofitable kind. B. will continue to\nexperience this need from time to time, until he is willing to realize that there\nis nothing he needs or wants to escape from.\n\nIt is very hard to get out of the chain of miscreation which can arise\nout of even the simplest mis-thought. To borrow one of your own phrases, “This\nkind of human tragedy is far easier to avert than to undo.”\n\nYou must both learn not to let this kind of chain reaction START. You\nwill NOT be able to control it once it has started, because everything and\neveryone will be pulled into the misprojection, and misinterpreted accordingly.\nNOTHING is lovely to the unloving. This is because they are CREATING ugliness.\n\nYou, Helen, were definitely not acting right-mindedly by writing these\nnotes right in front of Jonathan. (Note that you wrote his name as “Jonathan”\nthis time, although previously in these same notes you referred to him as\n“Louis,” intentionally using his real name. Actually, of course, it does not\nmatter what you call him, but NOTE that you FELT FREE at that time to CHOOSE the\nname YOU preferred to use. This time, you were FORCED to call him “Jonathan”\nbecause you were ATTACKING him when you took the notes in front of him, and are\nnow falling back on the magical device of “protecting his name.”\n\n(I had been considering calling B rather ambivalently, and had gotten\nup to do so, but remembered to ask. The answer was to call him at 8:30. It would\nbe better if HE called, but he may not decide to do so. If he does not, you\nshould try to get through, and if he has decided NOT to be there, just leave a\nmessage that it is not important. This is still a kindly gesture, and the message\nshould be put in a gentle way.) (B. did call HS)\n\nWithout going into further elaboration, and we could devote many hours\nto this, lets consider all the time that we had to waste today. AND all the notes\nthat could have been devoted to a better purpose than undoing the waste, and thus\ncreating further waste. There IS a better use for time, too. I would have liked\nto have spent some time on corrections of the past notes, as an important step\nbefore reviewing them. A major point of clarification is necessary in connection\nwith the phrase “replacing hatred (or fear) with love.”\n\n(No, Helen, do NOT check this against the prayer that B. very kindly\ntyped for you on the card. That WAS a gracious offering on his part, and YOU also\naccepted it with grace at the time. Why should you deprive yourself of the value\nof the offering by referring this correction first to HIM?)\n\n(These notes did not continue at this time, due to the obvious fact\nthat HS was still clearly not in her right mind. However, B later suggested that\n“correct” or “correct for” should be used instead of “replace.” At the time, he\nwas quite sure about this, and he was perfectly right. The reason why it was\nessential that HE make this correction was that the word “replace” was his choice\noriginally, and reflected a temporary misunderstanding of his own. It was,\nhowever, both courteous and necessary that he change this himself, both as a sign\nof his own better understanding, and of an avoidance of correction by someone\nelse, which would have been discourteous.)",

For example, I do NOT regard time as you and B. do, and Kolb's space\nproblem is NOT mine.

Only Right-Mindedness CAN create in a way that has any real effect.\nPragmatically, what has no real effect, has no real existence. Its REAL effect,\nthen, is emptiness. Being without substantial content, it lends itself to\nprojection.\n\nThe level-adjustment power of the miracle creates the right perception\nfor healing. Until this has occurred, healing cannot be understood. Forgiveness\nis an empty gesture, unless it entails correction. Without this, it is\nessentially judgmental, rather than healing.\n\nMiraculous forgiveness is ONLY correction. It has no element of judgment\nat all. “Father forgive them for they know not what they do” in NO way\nEVALUATES what they do. It is strictly limited to an appeal to God to HEAL their\nminds. There is no reference to the outcome of their misthought. THIS does not\nmatter.\n\nThe Biblical injunction “Be of one mind” is the statement for\nREVELATION readiness. My OWN injunction “Do this in remembrance of me” is the\nrequest for cooperation in miracle-workers.

    "content": "Atonement without Sacrifice\n\nThere is one more point which must be perfectly clear before any\nresidual fear which may still be associated with miracles becomes entirely\ngroundless. The Crucifixion did NOT establish the Atonement. The Resurrection\ndid. This is a point which many very sincere Christians have misunderstood.\nNobody who was free of the scarcity-fallacy could POSSIBLY have made this\nmistake.\n\nIf the Crucifixion is seen from an upside down point of view, it\ncertainly does appear AS IF God permitted, and even encouraged, one of his Sons\nto suffer BECAUSE he was good. Many very devoted ministers preach this every day.\nThis particularly unfortunate interpretation, which actually arose out of the\ncombined misprojection of a large number of my own would-be followers, has led\nmany people to be bitterly afraid of God.\n\nThis particularly anti-religious concept happens to enter into many\nreligions, and this is neither by chance nor coincidence.\n\nThe real Christian would have to pause and ask “how could this be?” Is\nit likely that God Himself would be capable of the kind of thinking which His own\nWords have clearly stated is unworthy of man?\n\n(There are times when) The best defense, as always, is NOT to attack\nanother's position, but rather to protect the truth. It is not necessary to\nconsider anything acceptable, if you have to turn a whole frame of reference\naround in order to justify it. This procedure is painful in its minor\napplications, and genuinely tragic on a mass basis. Persecution is a frequent\nresult, justifying the terrible misperception that God Himself persecuted His\nown Son on behalf of salvation. The very words are meaningless.\n\nIt has always been particularly difficult to overcome this because,\nalthough the error itself is no harder to overcome than any other error, men were\nunwilling to give it up because of its prominent escape value. In milder forms, a\nparent says “This hurts me more than it hurts you,” and feels exonerated in\nbeating a child. Can you believe that the Father REALLY thinks this way?\n\nIt is so essential that all such thinking be dispelled that we must be\nVERY sure that NOTHING of this kind remains in your mind. I was NOT punished\nbecause YOU were bad. The wholly benign lesson which the Atonement teaches is\nwholly lost if it is tainted with this kind of distortion in ANY form.\n\n“Vengeance is Mine sayeth the Lord” is strictly a karmic viewpoint.\nIt is a real misperception of truth, by which man assigns his own evil past to\nGod. The “evil conscience” from the past has nothing to do with God. He did not\ncreate it, and He does not maintain it. God does NOT believe in karmic\nretribution at all. His Divine mind does not create that way. HE does not hold\nthe evil deeds of a man even against HIMSELF. Is it likely, then, that He would\nhold against any man the evil that ANOTHER did?\n\nBe very sure that you recognize how impossible this assumption really\nis, and how ENTIRELY it arises from misprojection. This kind of error is\nresponsible for a host of related fallacies, including the misbelief that God\nrejected man and forced him out of the Garden of Eden, or that I am\nmisdirecting you. I have made every effort to use words which are ALMOST\nimpossible to distort, but man is very inventive when it comes to twisting\nsymbols around.\n\nGod Himself is not symbolic; He is FACT. The Atonement, too, is\ntotally without symbolism. It is perfectly clear, because it exists in light.\nOnly man's attempts to shroud it in darkness have made it inaccessible to the\nunwilling, and ambiguous to the partly willing. The Atonement itself radiates\nnothing but truth. It therefore epitomizes harmlessness, and sheds ONLY blessing.\nIt could not do this if it arose from anything other than perfect innocence!\nInnocence is wisdom, because it is unaware of evil, which does not exist. It is,\nhowever, PERFECTLY aware of EVERYTHING, that is true.\n\nThe Resurrection demonstrated that NOTHING can destroy truth. Good can\nwithstand ANY form of evil, because light abolishes ALL forms of darkness. The\nAtonement is thus the perfect lesson. It is the final demonstration that all of\nthe other lessons which I taught are true.\n\nMan is released from ALL errors if he believes in this. The deductive\napproach to teaching accepts the generalization which is applicable to ALL single\ninstances, rather than building up the generalization after analyzing numerous\nsingle instances separately. If you can accept the ONE GENERALIZATION NOW, there\nwill be no need to learn from many smaller lessons.\n\nNOTHING can prevail against a Son of God who commends his Spirit into\nthe hands of His Father. By doing this, the mind awakens from its sleep, and\nthe Soul remembers its Creator. All sense of Separation disappears, and level\nconfusion vanishes. The Son of God IS part of the holy Trinity, but the Trinity\nItself is One. There is no confusion within ITS levels, because they are of One\nMind and One Will. This Single Purpose creates perfect integration, and\nestablishes the (reign of the ) Peace of God.\n\nBut this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent. Because\ntheir hearts are pure, they defend true perception, instead of defending\nthemselves AGAINST it. Understanding the lesson of the Atonement, they are\nwithout the will to attack, and therefore they see truly. This is what the Bible\nmeans when it says “(and) when He shall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like\nHim, for we shall see Him AS HE IS.”\n\nSacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God. It arises solely from\nfear of the Records. This is particularly unfortunate, because frightened\npeople are apt to be vicious. Sacrificing others in any way is a clear-cut\nviolation of God's own injunction that man should be merciful even as His Father\nin Heaven is merciful.\n\nIt has been harder for many Christians to realize that this\ncommandment (or assignment) also applies to THEMSELVES. Good teachers never\nterrorize their students. To terrorize is to attack, and this results in\nrejection of what the teacher offers. This results in learning failures.\n\nI have been correctly referred to in the Bible as “The Lamb of God who\ntaketh away the sins of the world.” Those who represent the lamb as bloodstained\n(an all too widespread conceptual error) do NOT understand the meaning of\nthe symbol.\n\nCorrectly understood, the symbol is a very simple parable, or teaching\ndevice, which merely depicts my innocence. The lion and the lamb lying down\ntogether refers to the fact that strength and innocence are NOT in conflict,\nbut naturally live in peace. “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see\nGod” is another way of saying the same thing. Only the innocent CAN see God.\n\nThere has been some controversy (in human terms) as to whether seeing\nis an attribute of the eyes, or an expression of the integrative powers of the\nbrain. Correctly understood, the issue revolves around the question of whether\nthe body or the mind can see (or understand). This is not really open to question\nat all.\n\nThe body is not capable of understanding. Only the mind KNOWS\nanything. A pure mind knows the truth, and this IS its strength. It cannot attack\nthe body, because it knows EXACTLY what the body IS. This is what “a sane mind in\na sane body” really means.\n\nA sane mind is NOT out for blood. It does not confuse destruction with\ninnocence, because it associates innocence with strength, NOT with weakness.\nInnocence is INCAPABLE of sacrificing anything, because the innocent mind HAS\neverything and strives only to PROTECT its Wholeness. This is why it CANNOT\nmisproject. It can only honor man, because honor is the NATURAL greeting of the\ntruly loved to others who are LIKE them.\n\nThe lamb taketh away the sins of the world only in the sense that\nthe state of innocence or Grace, is one in which the meaning of the Atonement is\nperfectly apparent. The innocence of God is the true state of the mind of His\nSon. In this state, man's mind DOES see God, and because he sees Him as he Is, he\nknows that the Atonement, NOT sacrifice, is the ONLY appropriate gift to His OWN\naltar, where nothing except perfection truly belongs. The understanding of the\ninnocent is TRUTH. That is why their altars are truly radiant.\n\nThough Christians generally (but by no means universally) recognize the\ncontradiction involved in victimizing others, they are less adept at ensuring\ntheir own inability to victimize themselves. Although this appears to be a much\nmore benign error from the viewpoint of society, it is nevertheless inherently\ndangerous because once a two-edged defense is used, its direction cannot be selfcontrolled.\n\nB. recently observed how many ideas were condensed into relatively few\npages here. This is because we have not been forced to dispel miscreations\nthroughout. (There is one set of notes not yet transcribed which is devoted to\nthis. These emphasize only the enormous waste of time that is involved.) Cayce's\nnotes, too, could have been much shortened. Their excessive length is due to two\nfactors. The first involves a fundamental error which Cayce himself made, and\nwhich required constant undoing. The second is more related to the attitude of\nhis followers. They are unwilling to omit anything he said. This is respectful\nenough, but not overly-judicious. I would be a far better editor, if they would\nallow me this position on their staff.\n\nIt is obvious that Cayce himself was not able to transcend the\nmisperceptions of the need for sacrifice, or he could not possibly have been\nwilling to sacrifice himself. Anyone who is unable to leave the requests of\nothers unanswered has not entirely transcended egocentricity.\nI never “gave of myself” in this inappropriate way, nor would I ever have\nencouraged Cayce to do so.\n\nCayce could not see the Atonement as totally lacking in sacrifice at\nANY level. It WAS obvious to him that the mind cannot be so limited. It was\nequally apparent to him that the Soul is merely unaffected by such an idea. This\nleft him only the body with which to invest his misperception. This is also why\nhe used his own mind at the “EXPENSE of his body.”\n\nBecause Cayce was a somewhat erratic listener, he was compelled to\ncorrect his own errors at very great length, and not always adequately. Consider\nthe basis from which he started, when he began with “yes, we have the body.” It\nis noteworthy that in all these readings, a large section was actually devoted to\nthe body, even though he usually concluded with the caution that the body cannot\nbe healed by itself. It would have saved an enormous number of words if he had\nalways begun with this.\n\nCayce and his devotion to me are in no way underestimated by the\nrealization that he worked under very great strain, which is ALWAYS a sign that\nsomething is wrong. One of the difficulties inherent in trance states is that it\nis very difficult to overcome the split which the trance itself induces through\nthe medium of communications made while in the trance state.\n\nCayce's whole approach put him in a real double-bind, from which he\ndid not recover. When he spoke of a dream in which he saw his own rather immanent\nreincarnation, he was perfectly accurate. He was sufficiently attuned to real\ncommunication to make it easy to correct his errors, and free him to communicate\nwithout strain. It is noticeable throughout his notes that he frequently engaged\nin a fallacy that we have already noted in some detail: namely, the tendency to\nendow the physical with nonphysical properties. Cayce suffered greatly from this\nerror. He did not make either of the other three. However, you will remember that\nit is this one which is particularly vulnerable to magical associations. Cayce's\naccuracy was so great that, even when he did this, he was able to apply it\nconstructively. But it does not follow that this was a genuinely constructive\napproach.\n\nIt should also be noted that, when Cayce attempted to “see” the body\nin proper perspective, he saw physically discernible auras surrounding it. This\nis a curious compromise, in which the nonphysical attributes of the self are\napproached AS IF they could be seen with the physical eye.\n\nCayce's illiteracy never stood in his way. This is because illiteracy\ndoes not necessarily imply any lack of love, and in Cayce's case very definitely\ndid not. He therefore had no difficulty at all in overcoming this seeming\nlimitation.\nWhat DID hamper him was a profound sense of personal unworthiness, which,\ncharacteristically enough, was sometimes over-compensated for in what might be\ncalled a Christian form of grandiosity. Cayce was essentially uncharitable to\nhimself. This made him very erratic in his own miracles, and, because he was\ngenuinely anxious to help others, left himself in a highly vulnerable position.\n\nHis son comments both on the rather erratic nature of the Cayce\nhousehold, and also on the rather uneven nature of Cayce's temper. Both of these\nobservations are true, and clearly point to the fact that Cayce did not apply the\nPeace of God to himself. Once this had occurred, particularly in a man whose\ncommunication channels were open, it was virtually impossible for him to escape\nexternal solutions. Cayce was a very religious man, who should have been able to\nescape fear through religion. Being unable to apply his religion wholeheartedly\nto himself, he was forced to accept certain magical beliefs which were alien to\nhis own Christianity. This is why he was so different when he was asleep, and\neven disowned what he said in this state.\n\nThe lack of integration which this split state implies is clearly\nshown in certain off-the-mark detours into areas such as the effects of stones on\nthe mind, and some curious symbolic attempt to integrate churches and glands.\n(This is hardly more peculiar than some of your own confusion.)\n\nCayce's mind was imprisoned to some extent by an error against which\nyou have been cautioned several times. He looked to the past for an EXPLANATION\nof the present, but he never succeeded in separating the past FROM the present.\nWhen he said “mind is the builder,” he did not realize that it is only what it is\nbuilding NOW that really creates the future. The past, in itself, does not have\nthe ability to do this. Whenever we move from one instant to the next, the\nprevious one no longer exists. In considering the body as the focus for healing,\nCayce was expressing his own failure to accept this AS ACCOMPLISHED. He did not\nfail to recognize the value of the Atonement for others, but he did fail to\naccept its corrective merit for himself.\n\nAs we have frequently emphasized, man CANNOT control his own errors.\nHaving created them, he does believe in them. Because of his failure to accept\nhis own perfect freedom FROM the past, Cayce could not really perceive others as\nsimilarly free. This is why I have not wholly endorsed the Cayce documents for\nwidespread use.\n\nI am heartily supportive of the ARE's endeavor to make Cayce's\nsingular contributions immortal, but it would be most unwise to have them\npromulgated as a faith until they have been purged of their essential errors.\nThis is why\nthere have been a number of unexplained set backs in their explication. It is\nalso one of the many reasons why the Cayce material, a major step in the speedup,\nmust be properly understood before it can be meaningfully validated.\n\nCayce's son has been wise in attempting to deal with reliability,\nwhich in Cayce's case is very high. There is a way of validating the material,\nand Hugh Lynn is perfectly aware that this must be done eventually. He is also\naware of the fact that he is unable to do it. In the present state of the\nmaterial, it would be most unwise even to attempt it. There is too much that IS\ninvalid. When the time comes that this can be corrected to the point of real\nsafety, I assure you it will be accomplished. In tribute to Cayce, I remind you\nthat no effort is wasted, and Cayce's effort was very great.\n\nIt would be most ungrateful of me if I allowed his work to produce a\ngeneration of witch doctors. I am sorry that Cayce himself could not rid himself\nof a slight tendency in this direction. But fortunately I have a fuller\nappreciation of him than he had.\n\nI am repeating here a Biblical injunction of my own, already mentioned\nelsewhere, that if my followers eat any deadly thing it shall not hurt them. This\nis what Cayce could NOT believe, because he could not see that, as a Son of God,\nhe WAS invulnerable.",

    "content": "Miracles as Accurate Perception\n\nWe have repeatedly stated that the basic concepts referred to\nthroughout the notes are NOT matters of degree. Certain fundamental concepts\nCANNOT be meaningfully understood in terms of co-existing polarities. It is\nimpossible to conceive of light and darkness, or, everything and nothing, as\njoint possibilities. They are all true OR all false. It is absolutely essential\nthat you understand completely that behavior is erratic until a firm commitment\nto one or the other is made.\n\nA firm commitment to darkness or nothingness is impossible. Nobody has\never lived who has not experienced some light and some of everything. This has\nmade everybody really unable to deny truth totally, even if he deceives himself\nin this connection most of the time. That is why those who live largely in\ndarkness and emptiness never find any lasting solace. (This really answers B's\nquestion about whether people return voluntarily.)\n\nInnocence is also not a partial attribute. It is not a real defense\nUNTIL it is total. When it is partial, it is characterized by the same erratic\nnature that holds for other two-edged defenses. The partly innocent are apt to be\nquite stupid at times. It is not until their innocence is a genuine viewpoint\nwhich is universal in its application that it becomes wisdom.\n\nInnocent (or true) perception means that you NEVER misperceive, and\nALWAYS see truly. More simply, this means that you never see what does not exist\nin reality. Whenever you lack confidence in what someone else will do, you are\nattesting to your belief that he is not in his Right Mind. This is hardly a\nmiracle-based frame of reference. It also has the disastrous effect of denying\n(incorrect use) the essentially creative power of the miracle. The miracle\nperceives everything AS IT IS. If nothing but the truth exists (and this is\nreally redundant\nin statement, because what is not true CANNOT exist) Right-Minded seeing cannot\nsee ANYTHING BUT perfection. We have said many times that ONLY what God creates,\nor what man creates with the same will, has any real existence. This, then, is\nall that the innocent can see. They do not suffer from the delusions of the\nSeparated ones.\n\nThe way to correct all such delusions is to withdraw your faith from\nthem, and invest it ONLY in what is true. To whatever extent you side with false\nperception in yourself or others, you are validating a basic misperception. You\nCANNOT validate the invalid. I would suggest that you voluntarily give up all\nattempts to do so, because they can be only frantic. If you are willing to\nvalidate what is true in everything you perceive, you will make it true for you.\n\nRemember that we said that truth overcomes ALL error. This means that\nif you perceive truly, you are canceling out misperceptions in yourself AND\nothers simultaneously. Because you see them as they were really created and can\nreally create, you offer them your own validation of THEIR truth. This is the\nreal healing which the miracle actively creates.\n\nT 3 D 7. (Reply to HS question: Is this all? The reason why this is so short,\ndespite its extreme importance, is because it is not symbolic. This means that it\nis not open to more than one interpretation.)\nThis means that it is unequivocal. It also explains the quotation which you have\nnever gotten correctly in complete form before: “But this we know, that when He\nshall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He\nis. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as He is\npure.” Every man DOES have the hope that he can see correctly, because the\nability to do so is IN him. Man's ONLY hope IS to see things as they are).",

    "content": "Perception versus Knowledge\n\n(On Wed. evening, Nov. , HS had sudden flash of illumination and\nvery much wanted to offer prayer for B., which she did as follows: “Jesus, help\nme see my brother (B.) as he really is, and thus release both him and me.” HS\nalso thought later: Every time there is anything unlovable that crosses one's\nmind (re sex, possession, etc.) you should immediately recognize that you do not\nwant to hurt your brother.) On Thurs. morning, the prayer for the miracle\noccurred as follows stated above.)\n\nYou had a lot of trouble afterwards with the words (which are\nessentially irrelevant) partly because you were dissatisfied with yourself at the\ntime, but also because you ARE confused about the difference between perception\nand cognition. You will note that we have said very little about cognition as\nyet. (Aside: One of the exceptions is in the correction formula for fear, which\nbegins with KNOW first) The reason is because you must get your perceptions\nstraightened out before you can KNOW anything.\n\nTo know is to be certain. Uncertainty merely means that you DON'T\nknow. Knowledge is power BECAUSE it is certain, and certainty is strength.\nPerception is temporary. It is an attribute of the space-time belief, and is\ntherefore subject to fear or love. Misperception produces fear, and true\nperception produces love. NEITHER produces certainty because all perception\nvaries. That is why it is NOT knowledge. True perception is the BASIS for\nknowledge, but KNOWING is the affirmation of truth.\n\nAll of your difficulties ultimately stem from the fact that you do not\nrecognize, or KNOW, yourselves, each other, or God. “Recognize” means “know\nagain.” This means that you knew before. (Note that it does not mean SAW before.)\nYou can see in many ways, because perception involves different interpretations,\nand this means it is not whole.\nThe miracle is a way of PERCEIVING, not a way of knowing. It is the right answer\nto a question, but you do not ask questions at all when you know.\n\nQuestioning delusions is the first step in undoing them. The miracle,\nor the right answer, corrects them. Since perceptions CHANGE, their dependence on\ntime is obvious. They are subject to transitory states, and this implies\nvariability by definition. How you perceive at any given time determines what you\nDO, and action MUST occur in time. Knowledge is timeless because certainty is not\nquestionable. You KNOW when you have ceased to ask questions.\n\nThe “questioning mind” perceives itself in time, and therefore looks\nfor FUTURE answers. The unquestioning mind is closed merely because it believes\nthe future and the present will be the same. This establishes an unchanged state,\nor stasis. This is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear that the\nfuture will be WORSE than the present, and this fear inhibits the tendency to\nquestion at all.\n\nVisions are the natural perception of the spiritual eye, but they are\nstill corrections. B's question about the “spiritual eye” was a very legitimate\none. The “spiritual eye” is symbolic, and therefore NOT a device for knowing. It\nIS, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain\nof the miracle, but NOT of revelation. PROPERLY speaking, a “vision of God” is a\nmiracle rather than a revelation. The fact that perception is involved at all\nremoves the experience from the realm of knowledge. That is why these visions do\nnot last.\n\nThe Bible instructs you to “KNOW thyself,” or BE CERTAIN. Certainty\nis always of God. When you love someone, you have PERCEIVED him as he is, and\nthis makes it possible for you to KNOW him. But it is not until you RECOGNIZE him\nthat you KNOW him. Only then are you ABLE to stop asking questions about him.\n\nWhile you ask questions about God, you are clearly implying that you\ndo NOT know Him. Certainty does not require action. When you say you are ACTING\non the basis of sure knowledge, you are really confusing perception and\ncognition. Knowledge brings MENTAL strength for creative THINKING, but not for\nright doing.\n\nPerception, miracles and doing are closely related. Knowledge is a\nresult of revelation, and induces only thought (thinking). Perception involves\nthe body even in its most spiritualized form. Knowledge comes from the altar\nwithin, and is timeless because it is certain. To perceive the truth is not the\nsame as KNOWING it. This is why B. is having so much trouble in what he calls\n“integrating” the notes. His tentative perception is too uncertain for knowledge,\nbecause knowledge is SURE. Your perception is so variable that you swing from\nsudden but real knowledge to complete cognitive disorganization. This is why B.\nis more prone to irritation, while you are more vulnerable to rage. He is\nconsistently BELOW his potential, while you achieve it at times and then swing\nvery wide of the mark.\n\nActually, these differences do not matter. But I thought you might be\nglad to learn that you are much better off with DIFFERENT perceptual problems\nthan you would be if you suffered from similar ones. This enables each of you to\nRECOGNIZE (and this is the\n\nI repeat again that if you ATTACK error, you will hurt yourself. You\ndo not RECOGNIZE each other when you attack. Attack is ALWAYS made on a stranger.\nYou are MAKING him a stranger by misperceiving him, so that you CANNOT know him.\nIt is BECAUSE you have made him into a stranger that you are afraid of him.\nPERCEIVE him correctly, so that your Soul can KNOW him.\n\nRight perception is necessary before God can communicate DIRECTLY to\nhis own altars, which he has established in His Sons. There he can communicate\nHis certainty, and His KNOWLEDGE will bring the peace WITHOUT question.\n\nGod is not a stranger to His Own Sons, and His Sons are not strangers\nto each other. Knowledge preceded both perception and time, and will also\nultimately replace (or correct for) them. This is the real meaning of the\nBiblical account of God as “Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.” It\nalso explains the quotation “Before Abraham WAS, I AM.” Perception can and must\nbe stabilized, but knowledge IS stable. “Fear God and keep His Commandments” is a\nreal scribal error. It should read, “KNOW God and accept His certainty.” (This\nerror is why the commandments are all negative, in contrast to Christ's statement\nabout “Thou shalt love,” etc.) There are no strangers in His Creation. To\ncreate as He Created, you can create only what you KNOW and accept as yours.\n\nGod knows His Children with perfect certainty. He Created them by\nknowing them.",

    "content": "Conflict and the Ego\n\nMost of the abilities man now possesses are only shadows of his real\nstrengths. The Soul knows, loves, and creates. These are its unequivocal\nfunctions. All of the functions of man are equivocal, or open to question or\ndoubt. This is because he can no longer be certain how he will USE them. He is\ntherefore incapable of knowledge, because he is uncertain. He is also incapable\nof true loving, because he can perceive lovelessly. He cannot create surely,\nbecause perception deceives, and illusions are not pure.\n\nPerception did not exist until the Separation had introduced degrees,\naspects and intervals. The Soul has no levels, and ALL conflict arises from the\nconcept of levels. Wars arise when some regard others as if they were on a\ndifferent level. All interpersonal conflicts arise from this fallacy. Only the\nlevels of the Trinity are capable of Unity. The levels which man created by the\nSeparation are disastrous. They cannot BUT conflict. This is because one is\nessentially meaningless to another. Freud realized this perfectly, and that is\nwhy he conceived as forever irreconcilable the different levels of his psyche.\nThey were conflict-prone by definition, because they wanted different things and\nobeyed different principles.\n\nIn our picture of the psyche, there is an unconscious level, which\nproperly consists ONLY of the miracle ability and should be under MY direction;\nand a conscious level, which perceives or is aware of impulses from both the\nunconscious and the superconscious. These are the sources of the impulses it\nreceives. Consciousness is thus the level of perception, but NOT of knowledge.\nAgain, to PERCEIVE is NOT to know. (In this connection, Cayce is more accurate\nthan Freud.)\n\nConsciousness was the first split that man introduced into himself. He\nbecame a PERCEIVER rather than a creator in the true sense.\n\nConsciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego.\nIn a sense, the ego was a man-made\nattempt to perceive himself as he wished, rather than as he IS. This is an\nexample of the created/creator confusion we spoke of before. He can only KNOW\nhimself as he IS, because that is all he can be SURE of. Everything else IS open\nto question.\n\nThe ego is the questioning compartment in the post-Separation psyche\nwhich man created for himself. It is capable of asking valid questions, but not\nof perceiving wholly valid answers, because these are cognitive, and cannot BE\nperceived. The endless speculation about the meaning of mind has led to\nconsiderable confusion because the mind IS confused. Only One-Mindedness is\nwithout confusion. A separate, or divided, mind MUST be confused. A divided mind\nis uncertain by definition. It HAS to be in conflict because it is out of accord\nwith itself.\n\nIntrapersonal conflict arises from the same basis as interpersonal.\nOne part of the psyche perceives another part as on a different LEVEL, and does\nnot understand it. This makes the parts strangers to each other, WITHOUT\nRECOGNITION. This is the essence of the fear-prone condition, in which attack is\nALWAYS possible.\n\nMan has every reason to feel anxious, as he perceives himself. This is\nwhy he cannot escape fear until he KNOWS that he DID not and CAN not create\nhimself. He can NEVER make this misperception valid, and when he at last\nPERCEIVES clearly, he is GLAD HE CAN'T. His Creation is beyond his own error\nvariance, and this is why he MUST eventually choose to heal the Separation.\n\nRight-mindedness is not to be confused with the KNOWING mind, because\nit is applicable only to right perception. You can be right-minded or wrongminded,\nand this is subject to degrees, a fact which clearly demonstrates a lack\nof association with knowledge. (No, Helen, this is PERFECTLY clear and DOES\nfollow the previous section. Neither you nor I is at all confused, even in\ngrammar.)\n\nThe term “right-mindedness” is properly used as the correction for\nwrong-mindedness, and applies to the state of mind which induces accurate\nperception. It is miraculous because it heals misperception, and healing is\nindeed a miracle, in view of how man perceives himself. Only the sick NEED\nhealing. The Soul does not need healing, but the mind DOES.\n\nFreud gave a very graphic but upside down account of how the divisions\nof the mind arose from the bottom UP. Actually, this is impossible, because the\nunconscious cannot create the conscious. You cannot create something you can't\nKNOW. Freud was greatly worried about this, being VERY bright, though misguided,\nand attempted to get around it by introducing a number of “borderline” areas\nwhich merely resulted in fuzziness. This was particularly unfortunate, because he\nwas capable of going much higher, if he had not been so afraid. This is why he\nkept pulling the mind DOWN.\n\nThe ego did NOT arise out of the unconscious. A lower-order perception\ncannot create a higher-order one, (which is the way you perceive the structure of\nthe psyche if you look at it from the bottom UP) because it doesn't understand\nit. But a higher-order perception CAN create a lower-order one by understanding\nit in terms of MISperception.\n\nPerception ALWAYS involves some misuse of will, because it involves\nthe mind in areas of uncertainty. The mind is very active because it has willpower.\nWhen it willed the Separation it willed to perceive. Until it chose to do\nthis, it willed only to know. Afterwards, it had to will ambiguously, and the\nonly way out of ambiguity IS clear perception.\n\nThe ego is as frail as Freud perceived it. The later theorists have\ntried to introduce a less pessimistic view, but have looked in the wrong\ndirection for their hope. Any attempt to endow the ego with the attributes of the\nSoul, is merely confused thinking. Freud was more clear-sighted about this,\nbecause he knew a BAD thing when he perceived it, but he failed to recognize that\na bad thing cannot exist. It is therefore wholly unnecessary to try to get out of\nit. As you very rightly observed yourself, the thing to do with a desert is to\nLEAVE.\n\nThe mind returns itself to its proper function only when it WILLS TO\nKNOW. This places it in the Soul's service, where perception is meaningless. The\nsuperconscious is the level of the mind which wills to do this. (Freud was\nparticularly distorted on this point, because he was getting too far UP for\ncomfort according to his own perception.) But he WAS right in maintaining that\nthe “parts” of the psyche cannot be correctly perceived either as THINGS or as\nentirely separate. (He would have thought better if he had said “entirely\nseparated.”)\n\nThe mind DID divide itself when it willed to create its own levels AND\nthe ability to perceive them. But it could NOT entirely separate itself from the\nSoul, because it is FROM the Soul that it derives its whole power to create. Even\nin miscreating, will is affirming its source, or it would merely cease to be.\nThis is impossible, because it IS part of the Soul, which God created, and which\nis therefore eternal.\n\nThe ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must\nperceive SOMETHING, and WITH something. This is why perception involves an\nexchange, or a translation, which knowledge does NOT need. The interpretive\nfunction of perception, (actually, a distorted form of creation), then permitted\nman to interpret the body as HIMSELF, which, although depressing, was a way out\nof the conflict he induced. (This has already been covered in some detail.)\n\nThe superconscious, which KNOWS, could not be reconciled with this\nloss of power, because it was incapable of darkness. This is why it became almost\ninaccessible to the mind, and entirely inaccessible to the body. It was PERCEIVED\nas a threat, because light does abolish darkness by establishing the clear fact\nthat it ISN'T THERE. The truth will ALWAYS destroy error in this sense. This is\nnot an ACTIVE process of destruction at all. We have already emphasized the fact\nthat knowing does not DO anything. It can be PERCEIVED as an attacker, but it\nCANNOT attack.\n\nWhat man perceives as its attack is his own recognition of the fact\nthat it can always be REMEMBERED, because it has never been destroyed. This is\nnot a literal remembering as much as a re-membering. (That is largely for B. I\nwish he would decide to use that talent of his constructively. He has no idea of\nhow powerful it could be. Actually, it does come from the unconscious, and is\nreally a distorted form of miraculous perception which he has reduced to word\ntwisting. Although this can be quite funny, it is still a real waste. Maybe he'd\ncare to let me control it, and still use it humorously himself. He doesn't have\nto decide it is one OR the other.)\n\nThe unconscious should never have been reduced to a “container” for\nthe waste products of conflict. Even as HE perceives his psyche, every level has\na creative potential, because nothing man creates can wholly lose this.\n\nGod and the Souls He created remain in surety, and therefore KNOW that\nno miscreation exists. Truth cannot deal with unwilling error, because it does\nnot will to be blocked out. But I was a man who remembered the Soul and its\nknowledge. Tell B. that when he refused to misperceive he was indeed behaving as\nI behaved. And as a man, I did not attempt to counteract error with knowledge, so\nmuch as to CORRECT error from the bottom up. I demonstrated both the\npowerlessness of the body AND the power of the mind, by uniting MY will with that\nof my Creator, which naturally remembered the Soul and its own real purpose.\n\nI cannot unite your will with God's for you. But I CAN erase all\nmisperceptions from your mind, if you will bring it under my guidance. ONLY your\nmisperceptions stand in your own way. Without them, your own choice is certain.\nSane perception INDUCES sane choosing. The Atonement was an act based on true\nperception. I cannot choose for you, but I CAN help you make your own right\nchoice.\n\n“Many are called but few are chosen” SHOULD read, “ALL are called\nbut few choose to listen. Therefore, they do not choose RIGHT.” The “chosen ones”\nare merely those who choose right SOONER. This is the real meaning of the\ncelestial speed-up. Strong wills can do this NOW. And you WILL find rest for your\nSouls. God knows you only in peace, and this IS your reality.\n\n(Note that the term “insight,” though referring to lofty perception,\nis not an attribute of knowledge. This is why terms like “lofty” are meaningless\nin this context. Insight is not the way TO knowledge, but it IS a prerequisite\nFOR knowledge. Being of God, knowledge has nothing to do with your perceptions at\nall. That is why it can only be a gift of God TO you.)",

    "content": "The Loss of Certainty\n\nWe said before that the abilities which man possesses are only shadows\nof his true abilities. The Soul's true functions are knowing, loving, and\ncreating. The intrusion of the ability to perceive, which is inherently\njudgmental, was introduced only after the Separation. No one has been sure of\nanything since then. You will also remember that I made it very clear that the\nResurrection was the return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of\nmy will with the Father's.\n\nSince the Separation, the words “create” and “make” are inevitably\nconfused. When you make something, you make it first out of a sense of lack or\nneed, and second, out of a something that already exists. Anything that is made\nis made for a specific purpose. It has no true generalizability. When you make\nsomething to fill a perceived lack, which is obviously why you would make\nanything, you are tacitly implying that you believe in the Separation. Knowing\ndoes not lead to doing, as we have frequently observed already.\n\nWhat appears to be contradictory about the difference between knowing\nand perceiving, and Revelation and miracles, is again the fallacy that is the\nroot cause of all subsequent errors. The miracle was associated with perception,\nand not with knowing. However, we also noted that prayer is the medium of\nmiracles, and also the natural communication of the Creator and the Created.\nPrayer is always an affirmation of knowledge, not of accurate perception. That is\nwhy unless perception has entered into it, it calls on Revelation.\n\nThe confusion between your own creation and what you create is so\nprofound that it has literally become impossible to know anything, because\nknowledge is always stable. It is quite evident that human beings are not.\nNevertheless, they are perfectly stable as God created them. In this sense, when\ntheir behavior is unstable, they are obviously disagreeing with God's idea of the\nCreation. This is a fundamental right of man, although not one he would care to\nexercise if he were in his Right Mind.\n\nThe problem that is bothering you most is the fundamental question\nwhich man continually asks of himself, but which cannot properly be directed to\nhimself at all. He keeps on asking “himself” what he is. This implies that the\nanswer is not only one which he knows, but one which is up to him. The first part\nof this statement is perfectly true, but the second part is not. We have\nfrequently commented on the absolute necessity of correcting all fallacious\nthinking which associates man in any way with his own Creation. Man CANNOT\nperceive himself correctly. He has no image at all. The word “image” is always\nperception related, and is not a product of knowing. Images are symbolic, and\nstand for something else. The current emphasis on “changing your image” is a good\ndescription of the power of perception, but it implies that there is nothing to\nKNOW.\n\nPrayer is the medium of miracles, not because God created perceptions,\nbut because God created YOU. At the beginning of this course, we said that YOU\nare a miracle. Therefore, the miracle worker is a miracle NOT of his own\ncreation. Unless perception rests on some knowing basis, it is so unstable that\nit doesn't mean anything.\nKnowing is not open to interpretation, because its meaning is its own. It is\npossible to interpret meaning, but this is always open to error because it\ninvolves the perception of meaning. All of these wholly needless complexities are\nthe result of man's attempt to regard himself both as separated and unseparated\nat the same time. It is impossible to undertake a confusion as fundamental as\nthis without engaging in further confusion.\n\nMethodologically, man's mind has been very creative. But, as always\noccurs when method and content are separated, it has not been utilized for\nanything but an attempt to escape a fundamental and entirely inescapable impasse.\nThis kind of thinking cannot result in a creative outcome, though it has resulted\nin considerable ingenuity. It is noteworthy, however, that this ingenuity has\nalmost totally divorced him from knowledge.\n\nKnowledge does not require ingenuity at all. When we say “the truth\nshall set you free,” we mean that all this kind of thinking is a waste of time,\nbut that you are free of the need of engaging in it.\n\nNote again that the functions of the Soul were not referred to as\nabilities. This point requires clarification, because abilities are beliefs which\nare BASED on the scarcity fallacy, since they do not mean anything apart from\nwithin-group comparisons. As you yourself never fail to point out, “nobody has\nnone of an ability, and nobody has all of it.” That is, of course, why the curve\nnever rests on the line. The clearest implications of relativity, which properly\ninheres in this statement, DEMONSTRATE that abilities are not functions of the\nSoul. The Soul's functions are NOT relative. They are ABSOLUTE. They are OF God\nand FROM God, and therefore God-like.\n\nPrayer is a way of asking for something. When we said that prayer is\nthe medium of miracles, we also said that the only meaningful prayer is for\nforgiveness, because those who have been forgiven HAVE everything. Once\nforgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly without\nmeaning. Essentially, a prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request\nthat we may be able to recognize something we already have.\n\nIn electing the ability to perceive instead of the will to know, man\nplaced himself in a position where he could resemble his Father ONLY by\nperceiving miraculously. But he lost the knowledge that he HIMSELF is a miracle.\nMIRACULOUS CREATION was his own Source, and also his own real function. “God\ncreated man in his own image and likeness” is correct in meaning, but the words\nare open to considerable misinterpretation. This is avoided, however, if “image”\nis understood to mean “thought,” and “likeness” is taken as “of a like quality.”\nGod DID create the Son in His own Thought, and of a quality like to His own.\nThere IS nothing else.\n\nPerception is impossible WITHOUT a belief in “more” and “less.” Unless\nperception, at every level, involves selectivity, it is incapable of\norganization. In all types of perception, there is a continual process of\naccepting and rejecting, of organizing and reorganizing, and of shifting and\nchanging focus. Evaluation is an essential aspect of perception, because judgment\nMUST be made for selection. “Lack of lack” is a concept which is meaningless to a\nperceiver, because the ability to perceive at all RESTS ON lack.\n\nWhat happens to perceptions if there ARE no judgments, and there is\nnothing BUT perfect equality? Perception is automatically useless. Truth can only\nbe KNOWN. All of it is equally true, and knowing any part of it IS to know all of\nit.\n\nOnly perception involves partial awareness. Knowledge transcends ALL\nof the laws which govern perception. Partial KNOWLEDGE is impossible. It is all\nOne, and has no separate parts. (i.e. the parts have NOT separated.) This IS the\nreal knowledge. You who are really one with it need but know YOURSELF and your\nknowledge is complete. To know God's miracle is to know Him.\n\nForgiveness is the healing of the perception of separation. Correct\nperception of EACH OTHER is necessary ONLY because minds have willed to see\nthemselves AS separate beings. Each Soul knows God completely. This IS the\nmiraculous power of the Soul. The fact that each Soul has this power completely\nis a fact that is entirely alien to human thinking, in which if any ONE has\neverything, there is nothing LEFT.\n\nGod's miracles are as total as His Thought, because they ARE His\nthoughts. God shines in them all with perfect light. If they recognize this light\nanywhere, they know it universally. Revelation cannot be explained, because it IS\nknowledge. Revelation HAPPENS. It is the only REALLY natural happening, because\nit reflects the nature of God.\n\nAs long as perception lasts, prayer has a place. Since perception\nrests on lack, those who perceive have not totally accepted the Atonement and\ngiven over themselves to truth. Perception IS a separated state, and the\nperceiver DOES need healing. Communion, not prayer, is the natural state of those\nwho know. God and HIS miracles are inseparable.\n\nAll words, at best, are preparatory. THE word is really a thought. No\none WORD is universally meaningful, because a word is a symbol, but thought is\nnot divisible by creation. The original name for “thought” and “word” was the\nsame. The quotation should read “In the beginning was the thought, and the\nthought was with God, and the thought WAS God.” How beautiful indeed are the\nthoughts of God, who live in His light. Your worth is beyond perception because\nit is beyond doubt.\n\nDo not perceive yourself in different lights. KNOW yourself in the One\nLight, where the miracle which is you is perfectly clear.\n\nT 3 G 20. The prerequisites for therapy must include the following conditions:\n\nT  G 21 1. The procedure must involve the recognition rather than the denial\nof the importance of thought.\n\nT  G 22 2. The exact equality of everyone who is involved. This must include\nMe.\n\nT  G 23 3. No one is either therapist or patient. (B. should add “teacher or\npupil.”)\n\nT  G 24 4. Above all EVERYONE involved must want to give up everything that is\nNOT true. The reason for the negative emphasis here is that therapy implies\nsomething HAS gone wrong. Even though the purpose is to correct, those who are\nill ARE negative.\n\nT  G 25 5. Therapy is EXACTLY the same as all other forms of miracle-working.\nIt has no separate laws of its own. All of the points that were given for\nmiracles apply to therapy because, UNLESS therapy proceeds from miraclemindedness,\nit CANNOT heal.\n\nT  G 26 6. The therapist (hopefully) does have the role of being the better\nperceiver. (This is also, again hopefully, true of the teacher.) It does not\nfollow that he is the better knower. Temporarily, the therapist or teacher can\nhelp in straightening out twisted perceptions, which is also the only role that I\nwould ever contribute myself. All therapy should do is try to place EVERYONE\ninvolved in the right frame of mind to help one another. It is essentially a\nprocess of true courtesy, including courtesy to Me.\n\nAny form of mental illness can truthfully be described as an\nexpression of viciousness. We said before that those who are afraid are apt to be\nvicious. If we were willing to forgive other people's misperceptions of us, they\ncould not possibly affect us at all. There is little doubt that you can explain\nyour present attitudes in terms of how people used to look at you, but there is\nno wisdom in doing so. In fact, the whole historical approach can justifiably be\ncalled doubtful.\n\nAs you have so often said, no one has adopted ALL of his parents'\nattitudes as his own. In every case, there has been a long process of choice, in\nwhich the individual has escaped from those he himself vetoed, while retaining\nthose he voted FOR. B. has not retained his parents political beliefs, in spite\nof the particular kind of newspapers that constituted their own reading matter in\nthis area. The reason why he could do this was because he believed he was free in\nthis area.\n\nThere must be some acute problem OF HIS OWN that would make him so\neager to accept their misperception of his own worth. This tendency can ALWAYS be\nregarded as punitive. It cannot be justified by the inequality of the strengths\nof parents and children. This is never more than temporary, and is largely a\nmatter of maturational and thus physical difference. It does not last unless it\nis held onto.\n\nWhen B's father came to his new office and “destroyed” it, it is quite\napparent that B. MUST have been willing to let it be destroyed. The many times\nthat he has commented on this event alone would suggest that the extreme\nimportance of this misperception in his own distorted thinking. Why should anyone\naccord an obvious misperception so much power? There cannot be any real\njustification for it, because even B. himself recognized the real problem by\nsaying “How could he do this to me?” The answer is HE didn't.\n\nB. has a very serious question to ask himself in this connection. We\nsaid before that the purpose of the Resurrection was to “demonstrate that no\namount of misperception has any influence at all on a Son of God.” This\ndemonstration EXONERATES those who misperceive, by establishing beyond doubt that\nthey have NOT hurt anyone. B's question, which he must ask himself very honestly,\nis whether he is willing to demonstrate that his parents have NOT hurt him.\nUnless he is willing to do this, he has not forgiven them.\n\nThe essential goal of therapy is the same as that of knowledge. No one\ncan survive independently as long as he is willing to see himself through the\neyes of others. This will always put him in a position where he MUST see himself\nin different lights. Parents do not create the image of their children, though\nthey may perceive images which they do create. However, as we have already said, you are not an\nimage. If you SIDE WITH image-makers, you are merely being idolatrous.\n\nB. has no justification whatever for perpetuating ANY image of himself\nat all. He is NOT an image. Whatever is true of him is wholly benign. It is\nessential that he KNOW this about himself, but he cannot know it while he chooses\nto interpret himself as vulnerable enough to BE hurt. This is a peculiar kind of\narrogance, whose narcissistic component is perfectly obvious. It endows the\nperceiver with sufficient unreal strength to make him over, and then acknowledges\nthe perceiver's miscreation. There are times when this strange lack of real\ncourtesy appears to be a form of humility. Actually, it is never more than simple\nspite.\n\nBill, your parents did misperceive you in many ways, but their ability\nto perceive was quite warped, and their misperceptions stood in the way of their\nown knowledge. There is no reason why it should stand in the way of yours. It is\nstill true that you believe they DID something to you. This belief is extremely\ndangerous to your perception, and wholly destructive of your knowledge. This is\nnot only true of your attitudes toward your parents, but also of your misuse of\nyour friends. You still think that you MUST respond to their errors AS IF they\nwere true. By reacting self-destructively, you are GIVING them approval for their\nmisperceptions.\n\nNo one has the right to change himself according to different\ncircumstances. Only his actions are capable of appropriate variation. His belief\nin himself is a constant, unless it rests on perceptual acuity rather than\nknowledge of what he is.\n\nIt is your DUTY to establish beyond doubt that you are totally\nunwilling to side with (identify with) anyone's misperceptions of you, including\nyour own. If you become concerned with totally irrelevant factors, such as the\nphysical condition of a classroom, the number of students, the hour of the\ncourse, and the many elements which you may choose to select for emphasis as a\nbasis for misperception, you have lost the knowledge of what ANY interpersonal\nrelationship is for. It is NOT true that the difference between pupil and teacher\nis lasting. They meet IN ORDER to abolish the difference. At the beginning, since\nwe are still in time, they come together on the basis of inequality of ability\nand experience. The aim of the teacher is to give them more of what is\ntemporarily his. This process has all of the miracle conditions we referred to at\nthe beginning. The teacher (or miracle worker) gives more to those who have less,\nbringing them closer to equality with him, at the same time gaining for himself.\n\nThe confusion here is only because they do not gain the same things,\nbecause they do not NEED the same things. If they did, their respective, though\ntemporary roles would not be conducive to mutual profit. Freedom from fear can be\nachieved by BOTH teacher and pupil ONLY if they do not compare either their needs\nor their positions in regard to each other in terms of higher and lower.\n\nPresumably, children must learn from parents. What parents learn from\nchildren is merely of a different order. Ultimately, there is no difference in\norder, but this involves only knowledge. Neither parents nor children can be said\nto HAVE knowledge, or their relationships would not exist AS IF they were on\ndifferent levels. The same is true of the teacher and the pupil. Children have an\nauthority problem ONLY if they believe that their image is influenced BY the\nauthority. This is an act of will on their part, because they are electing to\nmisperceive the authority and GIVE him this power.\n\nA TEACHER with an authority problem is merely a pupil who refuses to\nteach others. He wants to maintain HIMSELF in a position where he can be misused\nand misperceived. This makes him resentful of teaching, because of what he\ninsists it has done to him.\n\nThe ONLY way out of this particular aspect of the desert is still to\nleave. The way this is left is to release EVERYONE involved, by ABSOLUTELY\nREFUSING to engage in any form of honoring error. Neither teacher nor pupil is\nimprisoned by learning unless he uses it as an attack. If he does this, he will\nbe imprisoned whether he actually teaches or learns, or refuses to be engaged\nin the process at all.\n\nThe role of a teacher, properly conceived, is one of leading himself\nand others out of the desert. The value of this role can hardly be\nunderestimated, if only because it was one to which I very gladly dedicated my\nown life. I have repeatedly asked MY pupils to follow me. This means that, to be\neffective teachers, they MUST interpret teaching as I do. I have made EVERY\neffort to teach you ENTIRELY without fear. If you do not listen, you will be\nunable to avoid the VERY obvious error of perceiving teaching as a threat.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to say that teaching is a process whose purpose\nis to produce learning. The ultimate purpose of ALL learning is to abolish fear.\nThis is necessary so that knowledge can happen. The role of the teacher is NOT\nthe role of God. This confusion is all too frequently made, by parents, teachers,\ntherapists, and the clergy. It is a real misunderstanding of both God and His\nmiracles. Any teacher who believes that teaching is fearful CANNOT learn because\nhe is paralyzed. He also cannot really teach.\n\nB. was quite right in maintaining that this course is a prerequisite\nfor his. However, he was really saying much more than that. The purpose of this\ncourse IS to prepare you for knowledge. So is the only real purpose of ANY\nlegitimate course. All that is required of you as a teacher is to follow Me.\n\nWhenever anyone decides that he can function only in SOME roles but\nnot in others, he cannot BUT be attempting to make a compromise which will not\nwork. If B. is under the misbelief that he is coping with the fear problem by\nfunctioning as an administrator and as a teacher of interns, but NOT as a teacher\nof students, he is merely deceiving himself. He owes himself greater respect.\nThere is nothing as tragic as the attempt to deceive one's self, because it\nimplies that you perceive yourself as so unworthy that deception is more fitting\nfor you than truth. Either you can function in all of the roles you have properly\nundertaken to fill, or you cannot function effectively in any of them. This IS an\nall or none decision. You CANNOT make inappropriate level distinctions within\nthis choice. You are either capable or not. This does not mean that you can DO\neverything, but it DOES mean that you are either totally miracle-minded or not.\nThis decision is open to NO compromise whatever. When B. says that he cannot\nteach, he is making the same mistake that we spoke of before, when he acted as if\nuniversal laws applied to everyone except him. This is not only arrogant, but\npatently untrue. Universal laws MUST apply to him, unless he does not exist. We\nwill not bother to argue about this.\n\nDescartes engaged in a very interesting teaching procedure, and one\nfrom which he himself learned a great deal. He began with doubting the existence\nof everything, except himself. He insisted that his own existence was not open to\ndoubt, and rebuilt his entire thought system on the one premise “I think,\ntherefore I am.” It is noteworthy that he arrived at accepting the entire system\nhe originally doubted, solely on the basis of this ONE piece of knowledge. There\nwas, however, a distinct shift in his own perception. He no longer really\nquestioned the reality of what he perceived, because he KNEW he was there.\n\nWe mentioned before that B. is not too sure of this, and that is why\nwe suggested that he concentrate on “Lord, here I am.” A teacher is unlikely to\nbe effective unless he begins with BEING THERE. B, this is not really open to\nquestion. You will lose all your fear of teaching and relating in any form once\nyou know who you are. There is no point whatever in remaining in the prison of\nbelieving that this is up to you. You do NOT exist in different lights. It is\nthis belief which has confused you about your own reality. Why would you want to\nremain so obscure to yourself?",

    "content": "Judgment and the Authority Problem.\n\nWe have already discussed the Last Judgment in some though\ninsufficient detail. After the Last Judgment, there isn't any more. This is\nsymbolic only in the sense that everybody is much better off WITHOUT judgment.\nWhen the Bible says “Judge not that ye be not judged” it merely means that if\nyou judge the reality of others at all, you will be unable to avoid judging your\nown. The choice to judge rather than know has been the cause of the loss of\npeace. Judgment is the process on which perception but not cognition rests. We\ncovered this before in terms of selectivity. Evaluation was said at that time to\nbe its obvious prerequisite.\n\nJudgment ALWAYS involves rejection. It is not an ability which\nemphasizes ONLY the positive aspects of what is judged, whether it be in or out\nof the self. However, what has been perceived and rejected, (or judged and found\nwanting) remains in the unconscious because it HAS been perceived. Watson had a\nvery relevant notion of the unconscious in this connection. In fact, it was so\nrelevant that he dropped it as officially out of accord with Behaviorism. He was\nright on both counts.\n\nOne of the illusions from which human perception suffers is that what\nit perceives and judges against has no effect. This cannot be true, unless man\nalso believes that what his judgment vetoes does not exist. He evidently does not\nbelieve this, or he would not have judged against it.\nIt does not really matter, in the end, whether you judge right or wrong. Either\nway, you are placing your belief in the unreal. This cannot be avoided in any\ntype of judgment, because it IMPLIES the belief that reality is yours to choose\nFROM.\n\nNeither of you has any idea of the tremendous release and deep peace\nthat comes from meeting yourselves and your brothers totally without judgment. If\nyou will look back at the earlier notes about what you and your brothers ARE, you\nwill realize that judging them in any way is really without meaning. In fact,\ntheir meaning is lost to you precisely BECAUSE you ARE judging them. All\nuncertainty comes from a totally fallacious belief that you are under the\ncoercion of judgment. You do not need it to organize your life, and you certainly\ndo not need it to organize yourselves.\n\nWhen you look upon knowledge, all judgment is automatically suspended,\nand this is the process that enables recognition to REPLACE perception. Man is\nvery fearful of everything he has perceived and refused to accept. He believes\nthat because he has refused to accept it, he has lost control over it. This is\nwhy he sees it in nightmares, or in pleasant disguise in what seems to be happier\ndreams. Nothing that you have refused to accept can be brought into awareness. It\ndoes NOT follow that it is dangerous. But it DOES follow that you have made it\ndangerous.\n\nWhen you feel tired, it is merely because you have judged yourself as\ncapable of being tired. When you laugh at someone it is because you have judged\nhim as debased. When you laugh at yourself, you are singularly likely to laugh at\nothers, if only because you cannot tolerate being more debased THAN others. All\nof this does make you tired, because it is essentially disheartening. You are not\nreally capable of being tired, but you are very capable of wearying yourselves.\n\nThe strain of constant judgment is virtually intolerable. It is a\ncurious thing that any ability which is so debilitating should be so deeply\ncherished. But there is a very good reason for this. (This, however, depends upon\nwhat you mean by good.)\n\nIf you wish to be the author of reality, which is totally impossible\nanyway, then you will insist on holding on to judgment. You will also use the\nterm with considerable fear and believe that judgment will someday be used\nagainst you. To whatever extent it IS used against you, it is due ONLY to your\nbelief in its efficacy as a weapon of defense for your own authority.\n\nThe issue of authority is really a question of authorship. When an\nindividual has a “authority problem,” it is ALWAYS because he believes he is the\nauthor of himself, and resents his own projection that you share his delusion in\nthis respect. He then perceives the situation as one in which two people are\nliterally fighting for his own authorship. This is the fundamental\nerror of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God.\n\nThe belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God at\nall. He is, however, eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but ONLY\nbecause He knows that it makes them unhappy. Souls were given their own true\nauthorship, and men preferred to remain anonymous when they chose to separate\nthemselves FROM their Author. The word “authority” has been one of their most\nfearful symbols ever since. Authority has been used for great cruelty, because,\nbeing uncertain of their true Authorship, men believe that their creation was\nanonymous. This has left them in a position where it SOUNDS meaningful to\nconsider the possibility that they must have created themselves.\n\nThe dispute over authorship has left such uncertainty in the minds of\nman that some people have gone so far as to doubt whether they were ever created\nat all. Despite the apparent contradiction in this position, it is in one sense\nmore tenable than the view that they created themselves. At least, it\nacknowledged the fact some TRUE authorship is necessary for existence.\n\nOnly those who give over all desire to reject can KNOW that their own\nrejection is impossible.\nYou have not usurped the power of God, but you HAVE lost it. Fortunately, when\nyou lose something, this does not mean that the something has gone. It merely\nmeans that YOU do not know where it is. Existence does not depend on your ability\nto identify it, or even to place it. It is perfectly possible to look on reality\nwithout judgment, and merely KNOW it is there. By knowing this, you are not\ndoubting its reality at all.\n\nPeace is a natural heritage of the Soul. Everyone is free to refuse to\naccept his inheritance, but he is NOT free to establish what his inheritance IS.\nThe problem which everyone MUST decide is the fundamental question of his own\nauthorship. All fear comes ultimately, and sometimes by way of very devious\nroutes, from the denial of Authorship. The offense is never to God, but only to\nthe denier himself. He has thrown away the reason for his own peace, and sees\nhimself only in pieces. This strange perception IS an authority problem. It is\nalso the basis for castration anxiety, since both forms of error are\nfundamentally the same.\n\nNeither you nor B. can find peace while this authority problem\ncontinues. But the truth is still that there IS no problem about this. There is\nno man who does not feel that he is imprisoned in some way. If this has been the\nresult of his own free will, he must regard his will as if it were NOT free, or\nthe obviously circular reasoning of his own position would be quite apparent.\n\nFree will MUST lead to freedom. Judgment always imprisons, because it\nseparates segments of reality according to highly unstable scales of desire.\nWishes are not facts, by definition. To wish is to imply that willing is not\nsufficient. However, no one really believes that what is wished is as real as\nwhat is willed. Instead of “seek you first the Kingdom of Heaven” say “Will ye\nfirst the Kingdom of Heaven,” and you have said “I know what I am, and I will\nto accept my own inheritance.”\n\nIt is ESSENTIAL that this whole authority problem be voluntarily\ndismissed at once and for all before B's course. Neither of you understands how\nimportant this is for your sanity. You are both quite insane on this point. (This\nis not a judgment. It is merely a fact. (No, Helen, you SHOULD use the word\n“fact.” This is just as much a fact as God is. A fact is literally a “making” or\na starting point. You DO start from this point, and your thinking is inverted\nbecause of it.)",

    "content": "Creating versus the Self-Image\n\nEvery system of thought MUST have a starting point. It begins with\neither a making or a creating, a difference which we have already covered. Both\nare acts of will, except that making involves doing, and creating involves active\nwilling. Their resemblance lies in their power as FOUNDATIONS. Their difference\nlies in what rests upon them. Both are cornerstones for systems of belief by\nwhich men live.\n\nIt is a mistake to believe that a thought-system which is based on\nlies is weak. NOTHING made by a child of God is without power. It is absolutely\nessential that you realize this, because otherwise you will not understand why\nyou have so much trouble with this course, and will be unable to escape from the\nprisons you have (made) created for yourselves. (The use of creative here was an\nerror. You should have said made for yourself.)\n\nYou have both made the error of the psychotherapist we described in\nsome detail before, and it is particularly serious at this time. You cannot\nresolve your authority problem by depreciating the power of your minds. It CAN\nhurt you if you misuse it, because you KNOW its strength. You also know that you\nCANNOT weaken it any more than you can weaken God.\n\nThe devil is a frightening concept ONLY because he is thought of as\nextremely powerful and extremely active. He is perceived as a force in combat\nwith God, battling Him for possession of Souls. He deceives by lies, and builds\nkingdoms of his own, in which everything is in direct opposition to God. Yet, he\nATTRACTS men rather than repels them, and they are perceived as willing to “sell”\nhim their Souls in return for gifts they KNOW are of no real worth at all.\n\nThis makes absolutely no sense. The whole picture is one in which man\nacts in a way he HIMSELF realizes is self destructive, but which he does NOT WILL\nto correct, and therefore perceives the cause as beyond his control.\n\nWe have discussed the fall or Separation before, but its meaning must\nbe clearly understood, without symbols. The Separation is NOT symbolic. It is an\norder of reality, or a system of thought that is PERFECTLY real in time, though\nnot in Eternity. All beliefs are real to the believer.\n\nThe fruit of only ONE tree was “forbidden” to man in his symbolic\ngarden. But God could not have forbidden it, or it could not have BEEN eaten.\nIf God knows His children, and I assure you he does, would he have put them in a\nposition where their own destruction was possible? The “tree” which was forbidden\nwas correctly named “tree of knowledge.” Yet God created knowledge, and gave it\nfreely to His Creations. The symbolism here is open to many interpretations, but\nyou may be SURE that any interpretation which perceives either God OR His\ncreations as if they were capable of destroying their own Purpose is wrong.\n\nEating of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression for\nincorporating into the self the ability for self-creation. This is the ONLY sense\nin which God and His souls are NOT co-creators. The belief that they ARE is\nimplicit in the “self concept,” a concept now made acceptable by its WEAKNESS,\nand explained by a tendency of the self to create an IMAGE of itself. Its fear\naspect is usually ascribed to the “father figure,” a particularly interesting\nidea, in view of the fact that nobody means the physical father by the term. It\nrefers to an IMAGE of a father in relation to an IMAGE of the self.\n\nOnce again, images are perceived, NOT known. Knowledge cannot deceive,\nbut perception CAN. Man can perceive himself as self-creating, but he CANNOT do\nmore than BELIEVE it. He CANNOT make it true. I told you before that when you\nfinally perceive correctly, you can only be GLAD YOU CAN'T.\nBut until then, the belief that you CAN is the central foundation-stone in your\nthought-system, and all your defenses are used to attack ideas which would bring\nit to light.\n\nYou and B. still believe you are images of your own creation. You are\nsplit with your own Souls on this point, and there is NO resolution, because you\nbelieve the one thing that is literally INCONCEIVABLE. That is why you CANNOT\ncreate, and are afraid to make or produce.\n\nYou, Helen, are CONSTANTLY arguing about the authorship of this\ncourse. This is NOT humility; it is a REAL authority problem. You, Bill, really\nbelieve that by teaching you are assuming a dominant or father role, and that the\n“father figure” will kill you. This is not humility either. Castration fears are\na particularly distorted reflection of the real basic anxiety, or Separation\nfear.\n\nThe mind can make the belief in Separation VERY real and VERY fearful.\nAnd this belief IS the devil. It is powerful, active, destructive, and clearly in\nopposition to God, because it literally denies His Fatherhood. Never\nunderestimate the power of this denial. Look at your lives and see what the\ndevil has made. But KNOW that this making will surely dissolve in the light of\ntruth, because its foundation IS a lie.\n\nYour creation by God is the only foundation which cannot be shaken,\nbecause the light is IN it. Your starting point IS truth, and you MUST return to\nthis Beginning. Much has been perceived since then, but nothing else has\nhappened. That is why your Souls are still in peace, even though your minds are\nin conflict.\n\nYou have not yet gone back far ENOUGH and that is why you become so\nfearful. As you approach the beginning, you feel the fear of the destruction of\nyour thought-systems upon you, as if it were the fear of death. There IS no\ndeath, but there IS a belief in death.\n\nThe Bible says that the tree that bears no fruit will be cut off and\nwill wither away. Be glad! The light WILL shine from the true Foundation of\nLife, and your own thought-systems WILL stand corrected. They CANNOT stand\notherwise.\n\nYou who fear salvation are WILLING death. Life and death, light and\ndarkness, knowledge and perception are irreconcilable. To believe that THEY can\nbe reconciled is to believe that God and man can NOT. Only the Oneness of\nKnowledge is conflictless. Your Kingdom is not of this world because it was\ngiven you from BEYOND this world. Only IN this world is the idea of an authority\nproblem meaningful. The world is not left by death but by truth, and truth CAN be\nknown by all those for whom the Kingdom was created, and for whom it waits.",

    "content": "Introduction\n\n(Aside to HS. You were both wise and devoted (two words which are\nliterally interchangeable in the sense that they truly bring on the exchange of\none another.) in claiming your scribal functions and working so late. You HAD\ncommitted a serious error against your brother, and one who had asked for your\nhelp. A devoted priestess does not do this. The Bible says you should go WITH a\nbrother twice as far as he asks. It certainly DOES NOT suggest that you set him\nBACK on his journey.\n\nDevotion to a brother CANNOT set YOU back either. It can ONLY lead to\nmutual progress. The result of genuine devotion is inspiration, a word which,\nproperly understood is the OPPOSITE of fatigue. To be fatigued is to be DISspirited,\nbut to be inspired is to be IN the spirit. To be egocentric IS to be\ndispirited. But to be self-centered in the RIGHT sense is to be inspired, or in\nthe Soul. The truly inspired are enlightened, and cannot abide in darkness.\n\nDo not attempt to break God's copyright, because His Authorship alone\nCAN copy right. Your own right authorship does NOT lie in remaking His copies,\nbut in creating LIKE Him.\n\nEmbarrassment is ALWAYS an expression of egocentricity, an association\nwhich has been made before. (Made, NOT created. This kind of association is\nALWAYS man-made). Both of you have completed the SCT stem: When I was called on\nto speak—with—“I became embarrassed and COULD NOT SPEAK.”\nThis should be corrected to “Recognized my Authorship.”\n\nTell B. that he cannot be embarrassed by his own words unless he\nbelieves that HE is responsible for them. We have already corrected “word” to\n“thought,” and he IS free to allocate the authorship for his thoughts as he\nelects. He can speak from his Soul or from his ego, precisely as he chooses. If\nhe speaks from his Soul, he has chosen to “be still and know that I am God.”\nThese words are inspired, because they come from KNOWLEDGE. If he speaks from his\nego, he is DISCLAIMING knowledge instead of AFFIRMING it, and is thus disspiriting\nhimself.\n\nThe dis-spirited have no choice BUT to be narcissistic, and to be\nnarcissistic IS to place your faith in the unworthy. Your real worth IS your\ndivine authorship, and your Soul is its acknowledgement. I cannot guide your egos\nEXCEPT as you associate them with your Souls.\n\nAttacking misidentification errors is neither MY function nor YOURS.\nDestroying the devil is a meaningless undertaking. Cervantes wrote an excellent\nsymbolic account of this procedure, though he did not understand his own\nsymbolism. The REAL point of his writing was that his \"hero” was a man who\nperceived himself as unworthy because he identified with his ego and perceived\nits weakness. He then set about to alter his perception, NOT by correcting his\nmisidentification, but by behaving egotistically.\n\nChesterton wrote an excellent description of Cervantes and his\nperception of his “unheroic hero,” a view of man which the ego tolerates all too\nfrequently, but the Soul NEVER countenances:\n“And he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain\nUp which a lean and foolish knight forever rides in vain.”\n\nDo not embark on foolish journeys because they are indeed in vain. The\nego may will them because the ego IS both lean and foolish. But the Soul CANNOT\nembark on them because it is forever Unwilling to depart from its Foundation. The\njourney to the cross should be the LAST foolish journey for every mind. Do not\ndwell upon it, but dismiss it as accomplished. If you can accept that as YOUR OWN\nlast foolish journey, you are free also to join My Resurrection. Human living has\nindeed been needlessly wasted in repetition compulsion. It re-enacts the\nSeparation, the loss of power, the foolish journey of the ego in its attempt at\nreparation, and finally the crucifixion of the body, or death. Repetition\ncompulsions can be endless, unless they are given up by an act of will, or, more\nproperly as active creation. Do not make the pathetic human error of “clinging to\nthe old rugged cross.” The only message of the crucifixion is in respect for\nman's ability to OVERCOME the cross. Unless he does so, he is free to crucify\nhimself as often as he chooses. But this was NOT the gospel I intended to offer\nhim.\n\nWe have another journey to undertake, and I hope that, if both of you\nwill read these notes carefully, they will help to prepare you to undertake it.",

    "content": "Right Teaching and Right Learning\n\nWe have spoken of many different human symptoms, and at this level\nthere IS almost endless variation. But there is only one cause for all of them.\nThe authority problem IS “the root of all evil.” Money is but one of its many\nreflections, and is a reasonably representative example of the kind of thinking\nwhich stems from it. The idea of buying and selling implies precisely the kind of\nexchange that the Souls cannot understand at all, because their own Supply is\nalways abundant, and all their demands are fully met.\n\nEvery symptom which the ego has made involves a contradiction in\nterms. This is because the mind is split between the ego and the Soul, so that\nWHATEVER the ego makes is incomplete and contradictory. Consider what a\n“speechless professor” means as a concept. It literally means a “nonprofessing\nprofessor,” or a “nonspeaking speaker.”\n\nUntenable positions such as this are the result of the authority\nproblem, which, because it accepts the one inconceivable thought as its premise,\ncan only produce ideas which are inconceivable. B. may claim (and has certainly\ndone so in the past) that the PROFESSORSHIP was thrust upon him. This is not\ntrue. He wanted it very much, and also worked hard to get it. He would not have\nhad to work so hard either, if he had not misunderstood it.\n\nThe term “profess” is used quite frequently in the Bible, but in a\nsomewhat different context. To profess is to identify with an idea and offer the\nidea to others to be THEIR own. The idea does NOT lessen; it becomes STRONGER.\nThe teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them BY teaching them.\n\nTeacher and pupil, therapist and patient, are all alike in the\nlearning process. They are in the SAME order of learning, and unless they SHARE\ntheir lessons they will lack conviction. If a salesman must believe in the\nproduct he sells, how much more must a teacher believe in the ideas which he\nprofesses. But he needs another condition; he must also believe in the students\nto whom he offers his ideas.\n\nB. could not be afraid to teach unless he still believes that\ninteraction means loss, and that learning means separation. He stands guard over\nhis own ideas, because he wants to protect his thought-system as it is, and\nlearning MEANS change. Change is always fearful to the separated, because they\ncannot conceive of it as a change toward HEALING the separation. They ALWAYS\nperceive it as a change for further separation, because separation WAS their\nfirst experience of change.\n\nBill, your whole fear of teaching is nothing but an example of your\nown intense separation anxiety, which you have handled with the usual series of\nmixed defenses in the combined pattern of attack on truth and defense of error,\nwhich characterizes ALL ego-thinking.\n\nYou insist that if you allow no change to enter into your EGO, your\nSOUL will find peace. This profound confusion is possible only if one maintains\nthat the SAME thought-system can stand on two foundations.\n\nNOTHING can reach the Soul from the ego, and nothing FROM the Soul can\nstrengthen the ego, or reduce the conflict within it. The ego IS a contradiction.\nMan's self and God's Self ARE in opposition. They are opposed in creation, in\nwill, and in outcome. They are fundamentally irreconcilable because the Soul\ncannot perceive, and the ego cannot know. They are therefore NOT IN\nCOMMUNICATION, and can never BE in communication.\n\nNevertheless the ego can learn, because its maker can be misguided,\nbut CANNOT make the totally lifeless out of the life-given. The Soul need not be\ntaught, but the ego MUST. The ultimate reason why learning or teaching is\nperceived as frightening is because true learning DOES lead to the relinquishment\n(NOT destruction) of the ego to the light of the Soul. This is the change the ego\nMUST fear, because it does not share my charity.\n\nMy lesson was like yours, and because I learned it I can teach it. I\nnever attack your egos (in spite of H's strange beliefs to the contrary), but I\nDO try to teach them how their thought-systems have arisen. When I remind you of\nyour TRUE Creation, your egos cannot BUT respond with fear.\n\nBill, teaching and learning are your greatest strengths now, because\nyou MUST change your mind and help others change theirs. It is pointless to\nrefuse to tolerate change or changing because you believe that you can\ndemonstrate by doing so that the Separation never occurred. The dreamer who\ndoubts the reality of his dream while he is still dreaming it is not really\nhealing the level-split.\n\nYou HAVE dreamed of a separated ego, and you HAVE believed in a world\nwhich rested upon it. This is very real to you. You cannot undo this by doing\nnothing and not changing.\n\nIf you are willing to renounce the role of guardians of your thoughtsystems\nand open them to me, I will correct them very gently, and lead you home.\nEvery good teacher hopes to give his students so much of his own thinking that\nthey will one day no longer need him. This is the one real goal of the parent,\nteacher, and therapist. This goal will not be achieved by those who believe that\nthey will LOSE their child or pupil or patient if they succeed.\n\nIt is IMPOSSIBLE to convince the ego of this, because it goes against\nall of its own laws. But remember that laws are set up to protect the continuity\nof the system in which the law-maker believes. It is natural enough for the ego\nto try to protect itself, once YOU have made it. But it is NOT natural for YOU to\nwant to obey its laws unless YOU believe in them.\n\nThe ego cannot make this choice because of the nature of its origin.\nBut YOU can, because of the nature of YOURS. Egos can clash in any situation, but\nSouls cannot clash at all. If you perceive a teacher as merely a “larger ego,”\nyou WILL be afraid, because to ENLARGE an ego IS to increase separation anxiety.\nDo not engage in this foolishness, Bill. I will teach with you and live with you,\nif you will think with me.\n\nBut my goal will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a\nteacher. This is the OPPOSITE of the ego-oriented teacher's goal. He is concerned\nwith the effect of HIS ego on OTHER egos, and he therefore interprets their\ninteraction as a means of ego preservation. This is no less true if he is afraid\nto teach than if he is frankly out to dominate through teaching. The form of the\nsymptom is only a reflection of his particular way of handling the separation\nanxiety.\n\nALL separation anxiety is a symptom of a continuing will to remain\nseparated. This cannot be repeated too often because you have NOT learned it.\nBill, you are afraid to teach ONLY because you are afraid of the impression your\nimage of yourself will make ON OTHER IMAGES. You believe that their APPROVAL of\nyour image will exalt it, but also that your separation anxiety will be\nincreased. You also believe that their DISAPPROVAL of it will lessen the\nseparation anxiety, but at the cost of depression.\n\nI would not be able to devote myself to teaching if I believed either\nof these ideas, and YOU will not be a devoted teacher yourself as long as you\nmaintain them. I am constantly being perceived as a teacher either to be exalted\nor rejected, but I do not accept either perception for myself.\n\nYour own worth is NOT established by your teaching. Your worth was\nestablished by God. As long as you dispute this, EVERYTHING you do will be\nfearful, and particularly any situation which lends itself easily to the\nsuperior-inferior fallacy. Teachers must be patient, and repeat their lessons\nuntil they are learned. I am willing to do so, because I have no right to set\nyour learning limits for you.\n\nOnce again,—NOTHING you do, or think, or will, or make is necessary to\nestablish your worth. This point IS NOT DEBATABLE except in delusions. Your ego\nis NEVER at stake because God did not create it. Your Soul is never at stake\nbecause He DID. Any confusion on this point IS a delusion, and no form of\ndevotion is possible as long as this delusion lasts.\n\nBill, if you will to be a devoted teacher rather than an egocentric\none, you will not be afraid. The teaching situation IS fearful if it is misused\nas an ego involvement. If you become afraid, it is BECAUSE you are using it this\nway. But the devoted teacher perceives the situation AS IT IS, and NOT as HE\nwills it. He does not see it as dangerous because HE is not exploiting it.\n\nThe ego tries to exploit ALL situations into forms of praise for\nitself in order to overcome its doubts. It will be doubtful forever, or better,\nas long as you believe in it. You who made it CANNOT trust it, because you KNOW\nit is not real. The ONLY sane solution is not to try to change reality, which is\nindeed a fearful attempt, but to see it as it is. YOU are part of reality, which\nstands unchanged beyond the reach of your ego, but within easy reach of your\nSoul.\n\nBill, again I tell you that when you are afraid, be still and KNOW\nthat God is real and YOU are His beloved son in whom he is well pleased. Do not\nlet your ego dispute this, because the ego cannot know what is as far beyond its\nreach as you are. God is NOT the author of fear. YOU are.\nYou have willed, therefore, to create unlike Him, and you have made fear for\nyourselves.\n\nYou are not at peace, because you are not fulfilling your function.\nGod gave you a very lofty responsibility which you are not meeting. You KNOW\nthis, and you are afraid. But your egos have chosen to be afraid INSTEAD of\nmeeting it. When you awaken you will not be able to understand this, because it\nis literally incredible.\n\nDO NOT BELIEVE THE INCREDIBLE NOW. Any attempt to increase its\nbelievableness is merely to postpone the inevitable. The word “inevitable” is\nfearful to the ego, but joyous to the Soul. God IS inevitable and you CANNOT\navoid Him any more than He can avoid YOU.\n\nThe ego is afraid of the Soul's joy, because once you have experienced\nthis, you will withdraw all protection from your ego and become totally without\ninvestment in fear. Your investment is great now, because fear is a witness to\nthe Separation, and your ego rejoices when you witness to it.\n\nLeave it behind. Do not listen to it, and do not preserve it. Listen\nonly to God, who is as incapable of deception as are the Souls he created. As\nteachers and therapists, release yourselves and release others. Do not present a\nfalse and unworthy picture of yourselves TO others, or accept such a picture OF\nthem yourselves.\n\nThe ego has built a shabby and unsheltering home for you, because it\ncannot build otherwise. Do not try to make this impoverished house stand. ITS\nweakness IS your strength. Only God could make a home that was worthy of His\nCreations, who have chosen to leave it empty by their own dispossession.\n\nHis Home will stand forever, and is ready for you when you choose to\nenter. Of this you can be wholly certain. God is as incapable of creating the\nperishable as your ego is of making the eternal.\n\nOf your egos you can do nothing to save yourselves or others. But of\nyour Souls you can do everything for the salvation of both. Humility is a lesson\nfor the ego, not for the Soul. The Soul is beyond humility, because it recognizes\nits radiance, and gladly sheds its light everywhere.\n\nThe meek shall inherit the earth because their egos are humble, and\nthis gives them better perception. The Kingdom of Heaven is the right of the\nSoul, whose beauty and dignity are beyond doubt, beyond perception, and stand\nforever as the mark of the love of God for His Creations, who are wholly worthy\nof Him and ONLY of Him. Nothing else is sufficiently worthy to be a gift for a\ncreation of God Himself.\n\nI will substitute for your ego if you will, but NEVER for your Soul. A\nfather can safely leave a child with an elder brother who has shown himself\nresponsible, but this involves no confusion about the child's origin. The brother\ncan protect the child's body and his ego, which are very closely associated, but\nhe does not confuse HIMSELF with the father because he does this, although the\nchild may.\n\nThe reason why I can be entrusted with YOUR body and YOUR egos is\nsimply because this enables YOU not to be concerned with them, and ME to teach\nyou their unimportance. I could not understand their importance to YOU if I had\nnot once been tempted to believe them myself. Let us undertake to learn this\nlesson together, so we can also be free of them together.\n\nI need devoted teachers as much as I need devoted priestesses. They\nboth heal the mind, and that is always my own aim. The Soul is far beyond the\nneed of your protection OR mine.\n\nThe Biblical quotation should read “In this world you need NOT have\ntribulation BECAUSE I have overcome the world.” THAT is why you should “be of\ngood cheer.”\n\nB's course was very carefully chosen, because “abnormal psychology” IS\nego psychology. This is precisely the kind of content which should never be\ntaught FROM the ego whose abnormality should be lessened by teaching, not\nincreased. You, Bill, are particularly well suited to perceive this difference,\nand can therefore teach this course as it should be taught. Most teachers have an\nunfortunate tendency to teach the COURSE abnormally, and many of the students are\napt to suffer considerable perceptual distortion because of their own authority\nproblem.\n\nYour teaching assignment (and I assure you it IS an assignment) will\nbe to present perceptual distortions without either engaging in them yourself, or\nencouraging your students to do so. This interpretation of your role and theirs\nis too charitable to induce fear.\nIf you adhere to this role, you will both engender and experience hope, and you\nwill inspire rather than dispirit the future teachers and therapists I am\nentrusting to you.\n\nI promise to attend myself, and you should at least credit with me\nwith some dependability in keeping my own promises. I never make them lightly,\nbecause I know the need my brothers have for trust.",

    "content": "The Ego and False Autonomy\n\nBill has asked lately how the mind could ever have made the ego. This\nis a perfectly reasonable question; in fact, the best question either of you\ncould ask. There is no point in giving an historical answer, because the past\ndoes not matter in human terms, and history would not exist if the same errors\nwere not being repeated in the present. B. has often told you that your thinking\nis too abstract at times, and he is right. Abstraction DOES apply to knowledge,\nbecause knowledge is completely impersonal, and examples are irrelevant to its\nunderstanding. Perception, however, is always specific, and therefore quite\nconcrete.\n\nPerceptual distortions are not abstractions. They are merely\nconfusions. Each man makes one ego for himself, although it is subject to\nenormous variation because of its instability, and one for everyone he perceives,\nwhich is equally variable. Their interaction IS a process which literally alters\nboth, because they were not made either BY or WITH the unalterable.\n\nIt is particularly important to realize that this alteration can and\ndoes occur as readily when the interaction takes place IN THE MIND as when it\ninvolves physical presence. THINKING about another ego is as effective in\nchanging relative perception as is their physical interaction. There could be no\nbetter example of the fact that the ego is an idea, though not a reality-based\nthought. Your own present state is the best concrete example B. could have of how\nthe mind could have made the ego. You DO have real knowledge at times, but when\nyou throw it away it is as if you never had it. This willfullness is so apparent\nthat B. need only perceive it to see that is DOES happen. If it can occur that\nway in the present, why should he be surprised that it occurred that way in the\npast? All psychology rests on the principle of continuity of behavior. Surprise\nis a reasonable response to the unfamiliar, but hardly to something that has\noccurred with such persistence.\n\nAn extreme example is a good teaching aid, not because it is typical,\nbut because it is clear. The more complex the material, the clearer the examples\nshould be for teaching purposes. (Bill, remember that for your own course, and do\nnot avoid the dramatic. It holds the student's interest precisely because it is\nso apparent that it CAN be readily perceived.) But, as we have said before, all\nteaching devices in the hands of good teachers are aimed at rendering themselves\nunnecessary. I would therefore like to use your present state as an example of\nhow the mind can work, provided you both fully recognize that it need not work\nthat way.\nI NEVER forget this myself, and a good teacher shares his own ideas, which he\nhimself believes. Otherwise, he cannot really “profess” them, as we used the term\nbefore.\n\nWith full recognition of its transitory nature, (a recognition which I\nhope you both share), H. offers a very good teaching example of alternations\nbetween Soul and ego, with concomitant variation between peace and frenzy. In\nanswer to B's question, it is perfectly apparent that when she is ego-dominated,\nshe DOES NOT KNOW her Soul. Her abstract ability, which is perfectly genuine and\ndoes stem from knowledge, cannot help her because she has turned to the concrete\nwhich she cannot handle abstractly. Being incapable of appropriate concreteness\nperceptually, because her ego is not her natural home, she suffers from its\nintrusions, but NOT from complete lack of knowledge.\n\nThe result is a kind of “double vision,” which would have produced an\nactual diplopia, if she had not settled for nearsightedness. This was an attempt\nto see the concrete more clearly through the ego's eyes, without the\n“interference” of the longer range. Her virtual lack of astigmatism is due to her\nreal efforts at objectivity and fairness. She has not attained them, or she would\nnot be nearsighted. But she HAS tried to be fair with what she permitted herself\nto see.\n\nWhy are you surprised that something happened in the dim past, when it\nis so clearly happening right now? You forget the love that even animals have for\ntheir own offspring, and the need they feel to protect them. This is because they\nregard them as part of themselves. No one disowns something he regards as a very\nreal part of himself. Man reacts to his ego much as God does to His Souls, --\nwith love, protection, and great charity. The reaction of man to the self he made\nis not at all surprising. In fact, it duplicates in many ways the way he will one\nday react to his real creations, which are as timeless as he is.\n\nThe question is not HOW man responds toward his ego, but only what he\nbelieves he IS. Again, belief is an ego-function, and as long as your origin is\nopen to belief at all, you ARE regarding it from an ego viewpoint. That is why\nthe Bible quotes me as saying, “Ye believe in God, believe also in me.” Belief\nDOES apply to me, because I am the teacher of the ego. When teaching is no longer\nnecessary, you will merely know God.\n\nBelief that there IS another way is the loftiest idea of which egothinking\nis capable. This is because it contains a hint of recognition that the\nego is NOT the self. Helen always had this idea, but it merely confused her. B.,\nyou were more capable of a long-range view, and that is why your eyesight is\ngood. But you were willing to see because you utilized judgment against what you\nsaw. This gave you clearer perception than Helen's, but cut off the cognitive\nlevel more deeply. That is why you believe that you never had knowledge.\n\nRepression HAS been a stronger mechanism in your own ego defense, and\nthat is why you find her shifts so hard to tolerate. Willfullness is more\ncharacteristic of her, and that is why she has less sense than you do. It is\nextremely fortunate, temporarily, that the particular strengths you will both\ndevelop and use are precisely those which the other must supply now. You who will\nbe the strength of God are quite weak, and you who will be God's help are clearly\nin need of help. What better plan could have been devised to prevent the\nintrusion of the ego's arrogance on the outcome?\n\nUndermining the foundation of an ego's thought-system MUST be\nperceived as painful, even though this is anything but true. Babies scream in\nrage if you take away a knife or a scissors, even though they may well harm\nthemselves if you do not. The speedup has placed you both in the same position.\n\nYou are NOT by any means prepared, and in this sense you ARE babies.\nYou have no sense of real self-preservation and are very likely to decide that\nyou need precisely what would hurt you most. Whether you know it now or not,\nhowever, you both HAVE willed to cooperate in a concerted and very commendable\neffort to become both harmLESS and helpFUL, two attributes which MUST go\ntogether. Your attitudes, even toward this, are necessarily conflicted, because\nALL attitudes are ego-based.\n\nThis will not last. Be patient awhile, and remember what we have said\nonce before; the outcome is as certain as God! Helen used to perceive the\nquotation “To him that hath shall be given” as a paradox that bordered on the\nironic. She also had a similar reaction to another related one: “Faith is the\ngift of God.” We have re-interpreted both of these statements before, but\nperhaps we can make them even clearer now.\n\nOnly those who have a real and lasting sense of abundance can be truly\ncharitable. This is quite obvious when you consider the concepts involved. To be\nable to give anything implies that you can do without it. Even if you associate\ngiving with sacrifice, you still give only because you believe you are somehow\ngetting something better so that you can do without the thing you give.\n\n“Giving to get” is an inescapable law of the ego, which ALWAYS\nevaluates itself in relation to others' egos, and is therefore continually\npreoccupied with the scarcity principle which gave rise to it. This IS the\nmeaning of Freud's “pleasure principle.” Freud was the most accurate “ego\npsychologist” we ever had, although he would not have preferred this description\nhimself. His ego was a very weak and deprived concept, which could function ONLY\nas a thing in need.\n\nThe “reality principle” of the ego is not real at all. It is forced to\nperceive the “reality” of other egos, because it CANNOT establish the reality of\nitself. In fact, its whole perception of other egos AS real is ONLY an attempt to\nconvince itself that IT is real.\n\n“Self esteem,” in ego terms, means nothing more than that the ego has\ndeluded itself into accepting its reality and is therefore temporarily less\npredatory. This “self esteem” is ALWAYS vulnerable to stress, a term which really\nmeans that a condition has arisen in which the delusion of reality of the ego is\nthreatened. This produces either ego-deflation or ego-inflation, resulting in\neither withdrawal or attack. The ego literally lives by comparisons. This means\nthat equality is beyond its grasp, and charity becomes impossible.\n\nThe ego NEVER gives out of abundance, because it was made as a\nSUBSTITUTE for it. This is why the concept of GETTING arose in the ego's thoughtsystem.\nAll appetites are “getting” mechanisms representing ego needs to confirm\nitself. This is as true of bodily appetites as it is of the so-called “higher”\nego needs. Bodily appetites are NOT physical in origin, because the ego regards\nthe body as its home, and DOES try to satisfy itself through the body. But the\nIDEA that this is possible is a decision of the ego, which is completely confused\nabout what is really possible. This accounts for its essential erraticness.\n\nConsider the inevitable confusion which MUST arise from a perception\nof the self which responds: When I was completely on my own I “had no idea what\nwas possible.”\nThe ego DOES believe it is completely on its own, which is merely another way of\ndescribing how it originated. This is such a fearful state that it can only turn\nto other egos, and unite with them in a feeble attempt at identification, or\nattack them in an equally feeble show of strength. The ego is free to complete\nthe stem: “When I was completely on my own” in any way it chooses, but it is NOT\nfree to consider the validity of the premise itself, because this premise is its\nFOUNDATION. The ego IS the belief of the mind that it is completely on its own.\n\nThe ego's ceaseless attempts to gain the Soul's acknowledgement and\nthus establish its own existence are utterly useless. The Soul in its knowledge\nis unaware of the ego. It does NOT attack the ego. It merely cannot conceive of\nit at all. While the ego is equally unaware of the Soul, it DOES perceive itself\nas rejected by something which is greater than itself. This is why self-esteem in\nego terms MUST be a delusion.\n\nThe creations of God do not create myths, but the creative efforts of\nman can turn to mythology, but only under one condition. What man then makes is\nno longer creative. Myths are entirely perceptions and are so ambivalent in form,\nand so characteristically good and evil in nature that the most benevolent of\nthem is not without fearful components, if only in innuendo.\nMyths and magic are closely associated, in that myths are usually related to the\nego origins, and magic to the powers which the ego ascribes to itself. Every\nmythological system includes an account of “the creation,” and associates this\nwith its particular perception of magic.\n\nThe “battle for survival” is nothing more than the ego's struggle to\npreserve itself and its interpretation of its own beginning. This beginning is\nalways associated with physical birth, because nobody maintains that the ego\nexisted before that point in time. The religiously ego-oriented tend to believe\nthat the Soul existed before, and will continue to exist afterwards, after a\ntemporary lapse into ego-life. Some actually believe that the Soul will be\npunished for this lapse, even though in reality it could not possibly know\nanything about it.\n\nThe term “salvation” does NOT apply to the Soul, which is not in\ndanger and does not need to be salvaged. Salvation is nothing more that “rightmindedness”\nwhich is NOT the one-mindedness of the Soul, but which must be\naccomplished before one-mindedness can be restored. Right-mindedness dictates the\nnext step automatically, because right perception is uniformly without attack, so\nthat wrong-mindedness is obliterated. The ego cannot survive without judgment,\nand is laid aside accordingly. The mind then has only ONE direction in which it\ncan move.\n\nThe directions which the mind will take are always automatic, because\nthey cannot BUT be dictated by the thought-system to which it adheres. Every\nthought-system has INTERNAL consistency, and this does provide a basis for the\ncontinuity of behavior. However, this is still reliability and NOT validity.\nReliable behavior is a meaningful perception, as far as ego thinking goes.\nHowever, VALID behavior is an expression which is inherently contradictory,\nbecause validity is an END, and behavior is a MEANS. These cannot be combined\nlogically, because when an end has been attained, the means for its attainment\nare no longer meaningful.\n\nTest constructors recognize that there are different kinds of\nvalidity, and also that they are of different orders. This means that they do not\nmean truth and do not pretend to mean it. Test validity can be judged by logic,\nby theory, and by practice, each being regarded as a different dimension. In each\ncase, the amount of confidence is expressed in some form of percentage, either\nquantitatively, or merely in terms of “high,” moderate, and low. But a hypothesis\nis tested as either true or false, to be accepted or rejected accordingly. If it\nis shown to be true it becomes a fact, after which no one attempts to evaluate it\nunless its status AS fact is questioned.\n\nEVERY idea which the ego has accorded the status of fact is\nquestionable, because facts are in the realm of knowledge. Confusing realms of\ndiscourse is a thinking error which philosophers have recognized for centuries.\nPsychologists are generally quite deficient in this respect, as are many\ntheologians. Data from one realm of discourse do not mean anything in another,\nbecause they can be understood only WITHIN the thought-systems of which they are\na part. This is why psychologists are concentrating increasingly on the ego, in\nan attempt to unify their clearly unrelated data. It need hardly be said that an\nattempt to relate the unrelated cannot succeed.\n\nThe recent ecological emphasis is but a more ingenious way of trying\nto impose order on chaos. We have already credited the ego with considerable\ningenuity, though not with creativeness. But it should always be remembered that\ninventiveness is really wasted effort, even in its most ingenious forms. We do\nnot have to EXPLAIN anything. This is why we need not trouble ourselves with\ninventiveness. The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the\nabstract creativity of God's Creations.",

    "content": "Love without Conflict\n\nWhen H. reads this to you, Bill, try to listen very carefully. You\nhave never understood what “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” means. The\nreason you cannot understand it is because it is NOT understandable to the ego,\nwhich interprets it as if something outside is inside, which does not mean\nanything. The word “within” does not belong. The Kingdom of Heaven IS you.\n\nWhat else BUT you did the Creator create, and what else but you IS His\nKingdom? This is the whole message of the Atonement, a message which in its\ntotality transcends the sum of its parts which we have covered before. Christmas\nis not a time; it is a state of mind. The Christ Mind wills from the Soul, not\nfrom the Ego, and the Christ Mind IS yours.\n\nYou, too, have a Kingdom which your Soul has created. It has not\nceased to create because your ego has set you on the road of perception. Your\nSoul's creations are no more fatherless than you are. Your ego and your Soul will\nnever be co-creators, but your Soul and YOUR Creator will ALWAYS be. Be confident\nthat your creations are as safe as you are. The Kingdom is perfectly united and\nperfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it. Amen.\n\nThat was written in that form because it is a good thing to use as a\nkind of prayer in moments of temptation. It is a declaration of independence. You\nwill both find it very helpful if you understand it fully.\n\nIn its characteristic upside down way, the ego has taken the impulses\nfrom the superconscious and perceives them as if they arise in the unconscious.\nThe ego judges what is to be accepted, and the impulses from the superconscious\nare unacceptable to it, because they clearly point to the unexistence of the ego\nitself.\nThe ego therefore experiences threat, and not only censors but also re-interprets\nthe data. However, as Freud very correctly pointed out what you do not perceive\nyou still know, and it can retain a very active life BEYOND your awareness.\n\nRepression thus operates to conceal not only the baser impulses, but\nalso the most lofty ones from the ego's awareness, because BOTH are threatening\nto the ego and, being concerned primarily with its preservation in the face of\nthreat, it perceives them as the same. The threat value of the lofty is really\nmuch greater to the ego, because the pull of God Himself can hardly be equated\nwith the pull of human appetites.\n\nBy perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from\nbeing swept away, as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge. The upper\nlevel of the unconscious thus contains the call of God as well as the call of the\nbody. That is why the basic conflict between love and fear is unconscious. The\nego cannot tolerate either and represses both by resorting to inhibition. Society\ndepends on inhibiting the former, but SALVATION depends on disinhibiting the\nlatter.\n\nThe reason you need my help is because you have repressed your own\nguide, and therefore need guidance. My role is to separate the true from the\nfalse in your own unconscious, so it can break through the barriers the ego has\nset up and shine into your minds. Against our united strength, the ego CANNOT\nprevail.\n\nIt should be quite apparent to you by now why the ego regards the Soul\nas its “enemy.” The ego arose from the Separation, and its\ncontinued existence depends on your continuing belief in the Separation. Reducing\nthe Soul impulses to the unconscious, the ego has to offer you some sort of\nreward for maintaining this belief. All it CAN offer is a sense of temporary\nexistence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending. It\ntells you that this life is YOUR existence because it IS its own.\n\nAgainst this sense of temporary existence, the Soul offers the\nknowledge of permanence and unshakeable BEING. No one who has experienced the\nrevelation of this can ever fully believe in the ego again. How can its meager\noffering to you prevail against the glorious gift of God?\n\nYou who identify with your egos cannot believe that God loves you. YOU\ndo not love what you have made, and what you have made does not love you. Being\nmade out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its own Maker.\nYou cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His\nSouls, because of the hatred you have for the Self you have made. You project\nonto your own idea of yourself the will to separate, which conflicts with the\nlove you also feel for what you have made because you made it.\n\nNo human love is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has\nexperienced love WITHOUT ambivalence, the concept is beyond its understanding.\nLove will enter immediately into any mind which truly wants it, but it MUST want\nit truly. This means that it wants it WITHOUT ambivalence, and this kind of\nwanting is wholly without the ego's “drive to get.”\n\nThere is a kind of experience that is so different from anything the\nego can offer that you will never recover. The word is used quite literally here,\n-- you will never be able to hide again. It is necessary to repeat that your\nbelief in darkness and in hiding IS why the light cannot enter.\n\nThe Bible has many references to the immeasurable gifts which are for\nyou, but for which YOU must ask. This is not the condition as the ego sets\nconditions. It is the glorious condition of what you ARE. No force except your\nown will is strong enough or worthy enough to guide you. In this you are as free\nas God, and must remain so forever.\n\nYou can never be bound except in honor, and that is always voluntary.\nLet us ask the Father in my name to keep you mindful of His love for you and\nyours for Him. He has never failed to answer this request, because it asks only\nfor what He has already willed. Those who call truly are ALWAYS answered.\n\nT 4 D 16. Note: HS became very fearful here, and rather vaguely thought the\nanswer was: “Thou shalt have no other Gods before me, because there ARE none. You\nstill think there are.”\n\nIt has never really entered your minds to give up every idea you have\never had that OPPOSES knowledge. You retain thousands of little scraps of\nmeanness which prevent the Holy One from entering. Light cannot penetrate through\nthe walls you make to block it, and it is forever UNwilling to destroy what you\nhave made. No one can see THROUGH a wall, but I can step around it.\n\nWatch your minds for the scraps of meanness, or you will be unable to\nask me to do so. I can help you only as our Father Created us. I will love you\nand honor you and maintain complete respect for what you have made. But I will\nneither love nor honor it unless it is true. I will never forsake you, any more\nthan God will. But I MUST wait as long as you will to forsake yourselves.\n\nBecause I wait in love and not in impatience, you will surely ask me\ntruly. I will come gladly in response to a single unequivocal call. Watch\ncarefully, and see what it is you are truly asking for. Be very honest with\nyourselves about this, for you we must hide nothing from each other.\n\nIf you will REALLY try to do this, you have taken the first step\ntoward preparing your minds for the Holy One to enter. We will prepare for this\ntogether, and once He has come, you will be ready to help me make other minds\nready for Him. How long will you deny Him His Kingdom?\n\nIn your own unconscious, deeply repressed by the ego, is the\ndeclaration of your release. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING. This is the one fact\nwhich MEANS that the ego does not exist, and which therefore makes it profoundly\nafraid. In the ego's language, to have and to be are different, but they are\nidentical to the Soul. It knows that you both HAVE everything and ARE everything.\nAny distinction in this respect is meaningful only when the idea of getting,\nwhich implies a lack, has already BEEN accepted. That is why we made no\ndistinction before between HAVING the Kingdom of God and BEING the Kingdom of\nGod.\n\nThe calm being of God's Kingdom, which in your sane mind is perfectly\nconscious, is ruthlessly banished from the part of the mind which the ego rules.\nThe ego is desperate because it opposes literally invincible odds whether you are\nasleep or awake. Consider how much vigilance you have been willing to exert to\nprotect your ego, and how little you have been willing to exert to protect your\nhigher mind. Who but the insane would undertake to believe what is not true, and\nthen protect this belief at the cost of Truth?",

    "content": "The Escape from Fear\n\nIf you cannot hear the voice of God, it is because you do not choose\nto listen. The fact that you DO listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated\nby your attitudes, your feelings, and your behavior. Your attitudes are obviously\nconflicted; your feelings have a narrow range on the negative side, but are never\npurely joyous; and your behavior is either strained or unpredictable.\nYet this IS what you want. This is what you are fighting to keep, and what you\nare vigilant to save. Your minds are filled with schemes to save the face of your\negos, and you do not seek the Face of God.\n\nThe glass in which the ego seeks to see its face is dark indeed. How\ncan it maintain the trick of its existence except with mirrors? But where you\nlook to find yourself is up to you. We have said that you cannot change your mind\nby changing your behavior, but we have also said, and many times before, that you\nCAN change your mind.\n\nWhen your mood tells you that you have willed wrongly, and this is so\nwhenever you are not joyous, then KNOW this need not be.\n\nIn every case you have thought wrongly about some Soul that God\ncreated, and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass. Think\nhonestly what you have thought that God would NOT have thought, and what you have\nNOT thought that God would have you think. Search sincerely for what you have\ndone and left undone accordingly. And then change your minds to THINK WITH GOD'S.\n\nThis may seem hard to you, but it is MUCH easier than trying to think\nAGAINST it. Your mind IS one with God's. Denying this and thinking otherwise has\nheld your ego together, but has literally split your mind. As a loving brother, I\nam deeply concerned with your minds, and urge you to follow my example as you\nlook at yourselves and at each other and see in both the glorious Creations of a\nglorious Father.\n\nWhen you are sad, KNOW that this NEED NOT BE. Depression ALWAYS arises\nultimately from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have.\nKNOW you are deprived of nothing, except by your own decisions, and then decide\notherwise.\n\nWhen you are anxious, KNOW that all anxiety comes from the\ncapriciousness of the ego, and NEED NOT BE. You can be as vigilant AGAINST the\nego's dictates as FOR them.\n\nWhen you feel guilty, KNOW that your ego has indeed violated the laws\nof God, but YOU have not. Leave the sins of the ego to me. That is what the\nAtonement is for. But until you change your mind about those your ego has hurt,\nthe Atonement cannot release you. As long as you feel guilty, your ego is in\ncommand, because only the ego CAN experience guilt. THIS NEED NOT BE.\n\nYou, Helen, have been more honest that B. in really trying to see whom\nyour ego has hurt, and also in trying to change your mind about them. (HS\ndoubtful whether this is accurate-written at a time when she was very angry.) I\nam not unmindful of your efforts, but you still have much too much energy\ninvested in your ego. THIS NEED NOT BE. Watch your minds for the temptations of\nthe ego, and do not be deceived by it. KNOW it offers you nothing.\n\nYou, B, have not made consistent efforts to change your mind except\nthrough applying old habit patterns to new ideas. But you have learned, and\nlearned it better than H., (HS doubtful about accuracy here) that your mind gains\ncontrol over ITSELF when you direct it genuinely toward perceiving someone ELSE\ntruly. Your lack of vitality is due to your former marked effort at solving your\nneedless depression and anxiety through disinterest. Because your ego WAS\nprotected by this unfortunate negative attribute, you are afraid to abandon it.\n\nWhen you have given up this voluntary dis-spiriting, you have already\nseen how your mind can focus, and rise above fatigue, and heal. But you are not\nsufficiently vigilant against the demands of your ego that you disengage\nyourself. THIS NEED NOT BE. The habit of engaging WITH God and His Creations is\neasily made if you refuse actively to let your minds slip away. Your problem is\nnot concentration: it is a belief that nobody, including yourself, is WORTH\nconsistent effort.\n\nSide with me CONSISTENTLY against this deception, as we have sided\nagainst it briefly already. Do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back.\nThe disheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but only the ego can be\ndisheartened.\n\nHave you REALLY considered how many opportunities you have to gladden\nyourselves, and how many of them you have refused? There is no limit to the power\nof a Son of God, but he himself can limit the expression of his power as much as\nhe wills. Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away, and releasing\nthe strength of God into everything you think and will and do. Do no settle for\nANYTHING less than this, and refuse to accept anything BUT this as your goal.\n\nWatch your minds carefully for any beliefs that hinder its\naccomplishment, and step away from them. Judge how well you have done this by\nyour own feelings, for this is the one RIGHT use of judgment. Judgment, like any\nother defense, can be used to attack or protect, to hurt or to heal. The ego\nSHOULD be brought to your own judgment and found wanting there. Without your own\nallegiance, protection, and love it cannot exist.\n\nJudge your ego truly, and you MUST withdraw allegiance, protection,\nand love from it. You are mirrors of truth in which God Himself shines in perfect\nlight. To the ego's dark glass you need but say, “I will not look there because I\nKNOW these images are not true.”\n\nThen let me the Holy One shine upon you in peace, knowing that this\nand only this MUST be! His Mind shone on you in your creation, and brought YOUR\nmind into being. His Mind still shines on you and MUST shine THROUGH you. Your\nego cannot prevent HIM from shining on you, but it CAN prevent you from letting\nHim shine THROUGH you.\n\nThe first coming of Christ is just another name for the Creation, for\nChrist is the Son of God. The SECOND coming of Christ means nothing more than the\nend of the ego's rule over part of the minds of men, and the healing of the mind.\nI was created like you in the First, and I am reminding you that I have called\nyou to join with me in the Second.\n\nIf you will think over your lives, you will see how carefully the\npreparations were made. I am in charge of the Second Coming as I have already\ntold you, and my judgment, which is used only for its protection, cannot be wrong\nbecause it NEVER attacks. YOURS is so distorted that you believe that I was\nmistaken in choosing you. I assure you this is a mistake of your own egos. Do NOT\nmistake it for humility.\n\nYour egos are trying to convince you that THEY are real, and I am not,\nbecause if I AM real, I am no more real than YOU are. That knowledge, and I\nassure you that it IS knowledge, means that Christ must come into your minds and\nheal them.\n\nWhile I am not attacking your egos, I AM working with your higher mind\nwhether you are asleep or awake, (just as your ego does with your lower mind.) I\nam your vigilance in this, because you are too confused to recognize your own\nhope.\n\nI was not mistaken. Your minds WILL elect to join with mine, and\ntogether we are invincible. You two will yet come together in my name and your\nsanity will be restored. I raised the dead by KNOWING that life is an eternal\nattribute of everything that the living God Created. Why do you believe that it\nis harder for me to inspire the dis-spirited or to stabilize the unstable? I do\nnot believe that there is an order of difficulty in miracles: YOU do. I have",

    "content": "The Ego-Body Illusion\n\nALL things work together for good. There are NO exceptions except in\nthe ego's judgment. Control is a central factor in what the ego permits into\nconsciousness, and one to which it devotes its maximum vigilance. This is NOT the\nway a balanced mind holds together. ITS control is unconscious.\n\nThe ego is further off balance by keeping its primary motivation\nUNconscious, and raising control rather than sensible judgment to predominance.\nIt has every reason to do this, according to the thought-system which both gave\nrise to it and which it serves. Sane judgment would inevitably judge AGAINST it,\nand MUST be obliterated by the ego in the interest of its self-preservation.\n\nA crucial source of the ego's off-balance state is its lack of\ndiscrimination between impulses from God and from the body. Any thought-system\nwhich makes THIS confusion MUST be insane. Yet this demented state is ESSENTIAL\nto the ego, which judges ONLY in terms of threat or nonthreat TO ITSELF.\n\nIn one sense, the ego's fear of the idea of God is at least logical,\nbecause this idea DOES dispel it. Fear of dissolution from the higher source,\nthen, makes SOME sense in ego terms. But fear of the body, with which the ego\nidentifies so closely, is more blatantly senseless. The body is the ego's home by\nits own election. It is the only identification with which it feels safe, because\nthe body's vulnerability is its own best argument that you CANNOT be of God.\n\nThis is the belief that it sponsors eagerly. Yet the ego hates the\nbody, because it does not accept the idea that the body is good enough as its\nhome. Here is where the mind becomes actually dazed. Being told by the ego that\nit is really part of the body, and that the body is its protector, it is also\nconstantly informed that the body can NOT protect it. This, of course, is not\nonly true, but perfectly obvious.\n\nTherefore, the mind asks, “Where can I go for protection?,” to which\nthe ego replies, “Turn to me.” The mind, and not without cause, reminds the ego\nthat it has itself insisted that it IS identified with the body, so there is no\npoint in turning to it for protection. The ego has no real answer to this because\nthere ISN'T any. But it DOES have a typical solution. It obliterates the question\nfrom the mind's awareness. Once unconscious, it can and does produce uneasiness,\nbut it cannot be answered because it cannot be asked.\n\nT 4 F 7. This is the question which MUST be asked: “Where am I to go for\nprotection?” Only an insane mind FAILS to ask it. Even the insane ask it\nunconsciously, but it requires real sanity to ask it consciously.\n\nIf you will remember your dream about the recorder, which was\nremarkably accurate in some ways because it came partly from ego-repressed\nknowledge, the real problem was correctly stated as “What is the question?”\nbecause, as you very well knew, the answer COULD be found if the question were\nrecognized. If you remember, there were a number of solutions you attempted, all\nego-based, not because you thought they would really work, but because the\nquestion ITSELF was obscure.\n\nWhen the Bible says “Seek and ye shall find,” it does NOT mean that\nyou should seek blindly and desperately for something you wouldn't recognize.\nMeaningful seeking is consciously undertaken, consciously organized, and\nconsciously directed. B's chief contribution to your joint venture is his\ninsistence that the goal be formulated clearly, and KEPT IN MIND.\n\nYou, Helen, are not good at doing this. You still search for many\ngods simultaneously, and this goal confusion, given a strong will, MUST produce\nchaotic behavior. B's behavior is not chaotic, because he is not so much goaldivided\nas not goal-ORIENTED. Where Helen has overinvested in many goals, B has\nunderinvested in ALL goals. He has the advantage of POTENTIALLY greater freedom\nfrom distractibility, but he does not care enough to use it. Helen has the\nadvantage of great effort, but she keeps losing sight of the goal.\n\nB has very intelligently suggested that you both should set yourself\nthe goal of really studying for this course. There can be no doubt of the wisdom\nof this decision, for any student who wants to pass it. But, knowing your\nindividual weaknesses as learners and being\na teacher with some experience, I must remind you that learning and wanting to\nlearn are inseparable.\n\nAll learners learn best when they believe that what they are trying to\nlearn is of value to them. But values in this world are hierarchical, and not\neverything you may WANT to learn has lasting value.\nIndeed, many of the things you want to learn are chosen BECAUSE their value will\nnot last. The ego thinks it is an advantage not to commit itself to ANYTHING that\nis eternal, because the eternal MUST come from God.\n\nEternalness is the one function that the ego has tried to develop, but\nhas systematically failed. It may surprise you to learn that had the ego willed\nto do so, it COULD have made the eternal, because, as a product of the mind, it\nIS endowed with the power of its own creator. But the DECISION to do this, rather\nthan the ABILITY to do it is what the ego cannot tolerate. That is because the\ndecision, from which the ability would naturally develop, would necessarily\ninvolve true perception, a state of clarity which the ego, fearful of being\njudged truly, MUST avoid.\n\nThe results of this dilemma are peculiar, but no more so than the\ndilemma itself. The ego has reacted characteristically here as elsewhere, because\nmental illness, which is ALWAYS a form of ego-involvement, is not a problem of\nreliability as much as of validity. The ego compromises with the issue of the\neternal, just as it does with all issues that touch on the real question in ANY\nway. By compromising in connection with all TANGENTIAL questions, it hopes to\nhide the REAL question and keep it OUT OF MIND. Its characteristic “business”\nwith non-essentials is precisely for that purpose.\n\nConsider the alchemist's age-old attempts to turn base metal into\ngold. (This typo was originally “god”). The one question which the alchemist did\nnot permit himself to ask was “What For?” He COULD not ask this, because it would\nimmediately become apparent that there was no sense in his efforts, even if he\nsucceeded. The ego has also countenanced some strange compromises with the idea\nof the eternal, making odd attempts to relate the concept to the unimportant in\nan effort to satisfy the mind without jeopardizing itself. Thus, it has permitted\nmany good minds to devote themselves to perpetual MOTION, but NOT to perpetual\nTHOUGHTS.\n\nIdeational preoccupations with conceptual problems set up to be\nincapable of solution are another favorite ego device for impeding the strongwilled\nfrom real progress in learning. The problems of squaring the circle, and\ncarrying pi to infinity are good examples. A more recent ego-attempt is\nparticularly noteworthy. The idea of preserving the body by suspension, thus\ngiving it the kind of limited immortality\nwhich the ego can tolerate, is among its more recent appeals to the mind.\n\nIt is noticeable that in all these diversionary tactics, the ONE\nquestion which is NEVER asked by those who pursue them is “What for?” This is the\nquestion which YOU must learn to ask in connection with everything your mind\nwills to undertake. What is your purpose? Whatever it is, you cannot doubt that\nit will channelize your efforts automatically. When you make a decision of\npurpose, then, you HAVE made a decision about future effort, a decision which\nwill remain in effect UNLESS you change the DECISION.\n\nPsychologists are in a good position to realize that the ego is\ncapable of making and accepting as real some very distorted associations which\nare not true. The confusion of sex with aggression, and resulting behavior which\nis the same for BOTH, is a good example. This is understandable to the\npsychologist, and does not produce surprise. The lack of surprise, however, is\nNOT a sign of understanding. It is a symptom of the psychologist's ability to\naccept as reasonable a compromise which is clearly senseless, to attribute it to\nthe mental illness of the patient rather than his own, and to limit his questions\nabout both the patient AND himself to the trivial.\n\nThese relatively minor confusions of the ego are not among its more\nprofound misassociations, although they DO reflect them. Your own egos have been\nblocking the more important questions which your minds should ask. You do NOT\nunderstand a patient while you yourselves are willing to limit the questions you\nraise about HIS mind, because you are also accepting these limits for YOURS. This\nmakes you unable to heal him AND yourselves. Be ALWAYS unwilling to adapt to ANY\nsituation in which miracle-mindedness is unthinkable. That state in ITSELF is\nenough to demonstrate that perception is wrong.",

    "content": "The Constant State\n\nIt cannot be emphasized too often that CORRECTING perception is merely\na temporary expedient. It is necessary ONLY because Misperception is a BLOCK to\nknowledge, while ACCURATE perception is a stepping-stone TOWARDS it. The whole\nvalue of right perception lies in the inevitable judgment which it necessarily\nentails that it is UNNECESSARY. This removes the block entirely.\n\nYou may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in\nthis world. And since this is a sensible question, it has a sensible answer. But\nyou\nmust be careful that you really understand the question. What IS the you who are\nliving in this world? Bill will probably have more trouble with this than you,\nbut if he will try not to close his mind, he may decide that we are NOT engaging\nin denial after all.\n\nTo help him, it might be wise to review a number of the concepts with\nwhich he does not appear to have trouble, except at times. He liked the idea of\ninvisibility, and was particularly open to the concept of different orders of\nreality. He also found the notion of varying densities of energy appealing. While\nhe may yet agree that these are merely teaching aids, this is a good time to\nemploy them.\n\nImmortality is a constant state. It is as true now as it ever was or\nwill be, because it implies NO CHANGE AT ALL. It is not a continuum, and it is\nNOT understood by comparing it with any opposite. Knowledge NEVER involves\ncomparisons. That is its essential difference from everything else the mind can\ngrasp.\n\n“A little knowledge” is not dangerous except to the ego. Vaguely the\nego senses threat, and, being unable to realize that “a little knowledge” is a\nmeaningless phrase because “all” and “a little” in this context are the same,\ndecides that since “all” is impossible, the fear does not lie in this. “A\nlittle,” however, is a scarcity concept, and this the ego understands well.\nRegarding “all” as impossible, “a little” is perceived as the real threat.\n\nThe essential thing to remember always is that the ego DOES NOT\nRECOGNIZE the real source of its perceived threat. And if YOU associate yourself\nWITH the ego, YOU do not perceive the whole situation as it really is. Only your\nallegiance to it gives the ego ANY power over you. We have spoken of the ego as\nif it were a separate thing, acting on its own. This was necessary to persuade\nyou that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and MUST realize how much of your\nthinking is ego-directed. But we cannot safely leave it at that, or you will\nregard yourselves as necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or more\nproperly, BELIEVE that you are here.\n\nThe ego is nothing more than a PART of your belief about yourselves.\nYour other life has continued without interruption, and has been and always will\nbe totally unaffected by your attempts to dissociate. The ratio of repression and\ndissociation of truth varies with the individual ego-illusion (tell Bill that\nphrase is VERY good), but dissociation is always involved, or you would not\nbelieve that you ARE here.\n\nWhen I told Bill to concentrate on the phrase “here I am, Lord,” I did\nnot mean “in this world” by “here.” I wanted him to think of himself as a\nseparate consciousness, capable of direct communication with the Creator of that\nconsciousness. He, too, MUST begin to think of himself as a very powerful\nreceiving and sending channel, a description I once gave you symbolically.\nRemember that HE understood it before you did, because you are more dissociative\nand less repressed.\n\nYour great debt to each other is something you should never forget. It\nis exactly the same debt that you owe to me. Whenever you react egotistically\ntowards each other, you are throwing away the graciousness of your indebtedness\nand the holy perception it would produce. The reason why the term “holy” can be\nused here is that, as you learn how much you ARE indebted to the whole Sonship\nwhich includes me, you come as close to knowledge as perception ever can. This\ngap is so small knowledge can easily flow across it and obliterate it forever.\n\nYou have very little trust in me as yet, but it will increase as you\nturn more and more often to me instead of to your egos for guidance. The results\nwill convince you increasingly that your choice in turning to me is the only sane\none you can make. No one who has learned from experience that one choice brings\npeace and joy while another brings chaos and disaster needs much conditioning.\nThe ego cannot withstand the conditioning process, because the process itself\nDEMONSTRATES that there is another way.\n\nThe classic conditioning by rewards model has always been most\neffective. Howard Hunt made a very good point in this connection, even though he\ndid not understand that the real reason why conditioning through pain is not the\nmost efficient method is because pain itself is an ego-illusion, and can never\ninduce more than a temporary effect.\n\nThe rewards of God are immediately recognized as eternal. Since this\nrecognition is made by YOU and NOT by your ego, the recognition ITSELF\nestablishes that you and your ego CANNOT be identical. You may believe that you\nhave already accepted the difference, but you are by no means convinced as yet.\nThe very fact that you are preoccupied with the idea of escaping FROM the ego\nshows this.\n\nYou cannot escape from the ego by humbling it, or controlling it, or\npunishing it. The ego and the Soul DO NOT KNOW each other. The separated mind\ncannot maintain the separation EXCEPT by dissociating. Having done this, it\nutilizes repression against all truly natural impulses, not because the EGO is a\nseparate thing, but because you want to believe that YOU are. The ego is a device\nfor maintaining this belief, but it is still only YOUR willingness to use the\ndevice that enables it to endure.\n\nMy trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it will\nnot always be that way. Your mission is very simple. You have been chosen to live\nso as to demonstrate that You are NOT an ego. I repeat that I do not choose God's\nchannels wrongly. The Holy One shares my trust and always approves my Atonement\ndecisions, because my will is never out of accord with His.\n\nI have told you several times that I am in charge of the whole\nAtonement. This is ONLY because I completed my part in it as a man, and can now\ncomplete it through other men. My chosen receiving and sending channels cannot\nfail, because I will lend them MY strength as long as theirs is wanting. I will\ngo with you to the Holy One, and through MY perception HE can bridge the little\ngap. Your gratitude to each OTHER is the only gift I want. I will bring it to God\nfor you, knowing that to know your brother IS to know God.\n\nA little knowledge is an all-encompassing thing. If you are grateful\nto each other you are grateful to God for what He created. Through your gratitude\nyou can come to know each other, and one moment of real recognition makes all men\nyour brothers because they are all of your Father. Love does not conquer all\nthings, but it DOES set all things right.\n\nBecause you are all the Kingdom of God, I can lead you back to your\nown creations, which you do not yet know. God has kept them very safe in HIS\nknowing while your attention has wandered. Bill gave you a very important idea\nwhen he told you that what has been dissociated IS STILL THERE. I am grateful to\nhim for that, and I hope he will not decide that it is true only for you. Even\nthough dissociation is much more apparent in you, and repression is much more\nevident in him, each of you utilizes both.\n\nWisdom always dictates that a therapist work through WEAKER defenses\nfirst. That is why I suggested to Bill that he persuade you to deal with\nREPRESSION first.\nWe have only just about reached the point where dissociation means much to you,\nbecause it is so important to your misbeliefs. Bill might do well, - and you\ncould help him here, - to concentrate more on HIS dissociative tendencies and not\ntry to deal with repression yet.\n\nI hinted at this when I remarked on his habit of disengaging himself,\nand when I spoke to him about distantiation. These are all forms of dissociation,\nand these weaker forms were always more evident in him than in you. That is\nbecause dissociation was so extreme in your case that you did not have to hide it\nbecause you were not aware that it was there. Bill, on the other hand, DOES\ndissociate more than he thinks, and that is why he cannot listen. He does not\nneed to go through the same course in repression that you did, because he will\ngive up his major misdefense AFTER he has rid himself of the lesser ones.\n\nDo not disturb yourself about repression, Bill, but DO train yourself\nto be alert to any tendency to withdraw from your brothers. Withdrawal is\nfrightening, and you do not recognize all the forms it takes in you. Helen is\nright that she will experience things that will cut across all her perceptions\nbecause of their stunning knowledge. You were right that this will occur when she\nlearns to recognize what she ALREADY knows and has dissociated.\n\nYou, Bill, will learn somewhat differently, because you are afraid of\nall complete involvements, and believe that they lessen YOU. You have learned to\nbe so much more clear-sighted about this that you should be ready to oppose it in\nyourself RELATIVELY easily. As you come closer to a brother, you DO approach me,\nand as you withdraw from him I become distant to you.\n\nYour giant step forward was to INSIST on a collaborative venture. This\ndoes NOT go against the true spirit of meditation at all. It is inherent IN it.\nMeditation is a collaborative venture with GOD. It CANNOT be undertaken\nsuccessfully by those who disengage themselves from the Sonship, because they are\ndisengaging themselves from me. God will come to you only as you will give Him to\nyour brothers. Learn first of them, and you will be ready to hear God as you hear\nthem. That is because the function of love is One.\n\nHow can you teach someone the value of something he has thrown away\ndeliberately? He must have thrown it away because he did NOT value it. You can\nonly show him how\nmiserable he is WITHOUT it, and bring it near very slowly, so he can learn how\nhis misery lessens as he approaches it. This conditions him to associate his\nmisery with its ABSENCE, and to associate the OPPOSITE of misery with its\npresence. It gradually becomes desirable, as he changes his mind about its worth.\n\nI am conditioning you to associate misery with the ego, and joy with\nyour Soul. You have conditioned yourself the other way around. But a far greater",

    "content": "Creation and Communication\n\nIt should be clear that, while the content of any particular egoillusion\ndoes not matter, it is usually more helpful to correct it in a specific\ncontext. Bill is right that you are too abstract in this matter. Ego-illusions\nare QUITE specific, although they frequently change, and although the mind is\nnaturally abstract, it became concrete voluntarily as soon as it splits. However,\nonly PART of it splits, so only PART of it is concrete.\n\nThe concrete part is the same part that believes in the ego, because\nthe ego DEPENDS on the specific. It is the part that believes your existence\nmeans you are SEPARATE. Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without\nthe relationships that imply BEING. The ego is thus AGAINST communication, except\nin so far as it is utilized to ESTABLISH separateness, rather than to abolish it.\n\nThe communication system of the ego is based on its own thoughtsystem,\nas is everything else it dictates. Its communication is controlled by its\nneed to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences\nthreat. While this is always so, individual egos perceive different kinds of\nthreat, which are quite specific in their own judgment. For example, although all\nforms of perceived demands may be classified (or judged) by the ego as coercive\ncommunication which must be disrupted, the response of breaking communication\nwill nevertheless be to a SPECIFIC PERSON or persons.\n\nThe specificity of the ego's thinking, then, results in a spurious\nkind of generalization, which is really not abstract at all. It will respond in\ncertain specific ways to all stimuli which it perceives as related. In contrast,\nthe Soul reacts in the same way to everything it know is true, and does not\nrespond at all to anything else. Nor does it make any attempt to ESTABLISH what\nis true. It knows\nthat what is true is everything that God created. It is in complete and direct\ncommunication with every aspect of Creation, because it is in complete and direct\ncommunication with its Creator.\n\nTHIS communication IS the will of God. Creation and communication are\nsynonymous. God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus\nestablishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will.\nSince only beings of a like order can truly communicate. His Creations naturally\ncommunicate WITH Him and communicate LIKE Him. This communication is perfectly\nabstract, in that its quality is universal in application, and not subject to ANY\njudgment, ANY exception, or ANY alteration.\n\nGod made you BY this and FOR this. The mind can distort its functions,\nbut it cannot endow itself with those it was not given. That is why the mind\ncannot totally lose the ability to communicate, even though it may refuse to\nutilize it on behalf of being. Existence as well as being rests on communication.\n\nExistence is SPECIFIC in how, what, and with whom communication is\nworth undertaking. Being is completely without these distinctions. It is a state\nin which the mind IS in communication with everything that is real, including its\nown Soul. To whatever extent you permit this state to be curtailed, you are\nlimiting your sense of your OWN reality, which becomes total only by recognizing\nALL reality in the glorious context of its real relationship to YOU. This IS your\nreality. Do not desecrate it or recoil from it. It is your real home, your real\ntemple, and your real self.\n\nGod, who encompasses ALL Being, nevertheless created separate beings\nwho have everything individually, but who want to share it to increase their joy.\nNothing that is real can be increased EXCEPT by sharing it. That is why God\nHimself created you. Divine Abstraction takes joy in application, and that is\nwhat creation MEANS. How, what, and to whom are irrelevant, because real creation\ngives everything since it can only create like itself. Remember that in being,\nthere is no difference between having and being, as there is in existence. In the\nstate of being, the mind gives everything always.\n\nThe Bible repeatedly states that you should praise God. This hardly\nmeans that you should tell Him how wonderful He is. He has no ego with which to\naccept\nthanks, and no perceptions with which to judge your offerings. But unless you\ntake your part in the creation, His joy is not complete because YOURS is\nincomplete. And THIS He does know. He knows it in his own Being and its\nexperience of His Sons' experience. The constant GOING OUT of His love is blocked\nwhen His Channels are closed, and He IS lonely when the minds He created do not\ncommunicate fully with Him.\n\nGod HAS kept your kingdom for you, but He cannot share His joy with\nyou until you know it with your whole mind. Even revelation is not enough,\nbecause it is communication FROM God. But it is not enough until it is shared.\nGod does not need revelation returned to Him, which would clearly be impossible,\nbut He DOES want revelation brought to others. This cannot be done with the\nactual revelation, because its content cannot be expressed, and it is intensely\npersonal to the mind which receives it. But it can still be returned BY that mind\nthrough its attitudes to other minds which the knowledge from the revelation\nbrings.\n\nGod is praised whenever any mind learns to be wholly helpful. This is\nimpossible without being wholly harmless, because the two beliefs cannot coexist.\nThe truly helpful are invulnerable, because they are NOT protecting their egos,\nso that nothing CAN hurt them. Their helpfullness IS their praise of God, and He\nwill return their praise of Him, because they are like Him and can rejoice\ntogether. God goes out to them and through them, and there is great joy\nthroughout the Kingdom. Every mind that is changed adds to this joy with its own\nindividual willingness to share in it.\n\nThe truly helpful are God's miracle-workers, whom I direct until we\nare all united in the joy of the kingdom. I will direct you to wherever you can\nbe truly helpful, and to whoever can follow my guidance through you. I arranged\nfor Bill to attend the rehabilitation meetings for very good reasons, and I want\nhim to know them so we can share our goal there.",

    "content": "True Rehabilitation\n\nProperly speaking, every mind which is split needs rehabilitation. The\nmedical orientation emphasizes the body, and the vocational orientation stresses\nthe ego. The team approach generally leads more to confusion than anything else,\nbecause it is too often misused as an expedient for sharing the ego's dominion\nwith other ego's rather than as a real experiment in cooperation of minds.\n\nThe reason why Bill needs this experience is because he needs\nrehabilitating himself. How often have I answered “help him” when you asked me to\nhelp you? He, too, has asked for help, and he has been helped whenever he was\ntruly helpful to you. He has also gained to whatever extent he could give. He\nwill help YOU more truly by going, if he can remember all the time he is there\nthat his ONLY reason for being there is to REPRESENT ME.\n\nRehabilitation, as a movement, has been an improvement over overt\nneglect, but it is often little more than a painful attempt on the part of the\nhalt to lead the blind. Bill, you will see this at every meeting. But this is not\nwhy you were chosen to go. You have a fear of broken bodies, because your ego\ncannot tolerate them. Your ego cannot tolerate ego-weakness, either, without\nambivalence, because it is afraid of its own weakness and the weakness of its\nchosen home.\n\nThat is really why you recoil from the demands of the dependent, and\nfrom the sight of a broken body. Your ego is threatened, and blocks your natural\nimpulse to help, placing you under the strain of divided will. You withdraw to\nallow your ego to recover, and to regain enough strength to be helpful again on a\nbasis limited enough NOT to threaten your ego, but also too limited to give YOU\njoy.\n\nThose with broken bodies are often looked down on by the ego, because\nof its belief that nothing but a perfect body is worthy as its OWN temple. A mind\nthat recoils from a hurt body is in great need of rehabilitation itself. A\ndamaged brain is also hardly a danger. ALL symptoms of hurt need true\nhelpfullness, and whenever they are met with this, the mind that so meets them\nheals ITSELF.\n\nRehabilitation is an attitude of praising God as He Himself knows\npraise. He offers praise to you, and you must offer it to others. The real\nlimitations on clinical psychology, as it is evaluated by its followers at\npresent, are not reflected by the attitudes of psychiatrists, or medical boards,\nor hospital administrators, even though most of them are sadly in need of\nrehabilitation themselves.\n\nThe real handicaps of the clinicians lie in their attitudes to those\nwhom their egos perceive as weakened and damaged. By these evaluations, they have\nweakened and damaged their own helpfullness, and have thus set their own\nrehabilitation back. Rehabilitation is NOT concerned with the ego's fight for\ncontrol, nor the ego's need to avoid and withdraw.\n\nBill, you can do much on behalf of your own rehabilitation AND Helen's,\nand much more universally as well, if you think of the Princeton meetings in this way:\n\n<i>I am here ONLY to be truly helpful.\n\nI am here to represent Christ, who sent me.\n\nI do not have to worry about what to say or what to do,\n\nbecause the one who sent me will direct me.\n\nI am content to be wherever He wishes,  knowing he goes there with me.\n\nI will be healed as I let him teach me to heal.</i>",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nTo heal is to make happy. I told you once to think how many\nopportunities you have to gladden yourselves, and how many you have refused. This\nis exactly the same as telling you that you have refused to heal yourselves. The\nlight that belongs in you is the light of joy. Radiance is not associated with\nsorrow. Depression is often contagious, but although it may affect those who come\nin contact with it, they do not yield to its influence wholeheartedly. But joy\ncalls forth an integrated willingness to share in it, and thus promotes the\nmind's natural impulse to RESPOND AS ONE.\n\nThose who attempt to heal without being wholly joyous themselves call\nforth different kinds of responses at the same time, and thus deprive others of\nthe joy of responding wholeheartedly. To be wholehearted, you MUST be happy. If\nfear and love cannot coexist, and if it is impossible to be wholly fearful and\nremain alive, then the only possible whole state IS that of love. There is no\ndifference between love and joy. Therefore, the only possible whole state IS the\nwholly joyous.\n\nTo heal, or to make joyous, is therefore the same as to integrate and\nMAKE ONE. That is why it makes no difference TO what part or BY what part of the\nSonship the healing is done. EVERY part benefits, and benefits equally. YOU are\nbeing blessed by every beneficent thought of any of your brothers anywhere. You\nshould want to bless them in return, out of gratitude.\n\nYou do not have to know them individually, or they you. The light of\njoy is so strong that it radiates throughout the Sonship and returns thanks to the\nFather for radiating HIS joy upon it. Only God's own holy children are worthy to\nbe channels of his beautiful joy, because only they are beautiful enough to hold",

    "content": "Healing as Joining\n\nHealing is an act of thought by which two minds perceive their\noneness, and become glad. This gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to\nrejoice with them, and let God Himself go out into them and through them. Only\nthe healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect, because revelation\nis an experience of pure joy. If you do not will to be wholly joyous, your mind\ncannot HAVE what it does not will to BE.\n\nRemember that the Soul knows no difference between being and having.\nThe higher mind thinks according to the laws which the Soul obeys, and therefore\nhonors only the laws of God. To Him, getting is meaningless, and giving is all.\nHaving everything, the Soul HOLDS everything by GIVING it, thus creating as the\nFather created.\n\nIf you think about it, you will see that, while this kind of thinking\nis totally alien to having THINGS, even to the lower mind it is quite\ncomprehensible in connection with IDEAS. If you share a physical possession, you\nDO divide its ownership. But if you share an IDEA, you do NOT lessen it. ALL of\nit is still yours, although all of it has been given away. Further, if the person\nto whom you give it accepts it as HIS, he reinforces it in YOUR mind, and thus\nINCREASES it.\n\nIf you can accept the concept that the world IS one of ideas, the\nwhole belief in the false association which the ego has made between giving and\nLOSING is gone. Let us start our process of re-awakening with just a few simple\nconcepts:\n\nThoughts INCREASE by being given away.\n\nThe more who BELIEVE in them, the STRONGER they become.\n\nEVERYTHING is an idea.\n\nHow, then, is it possible that giving and losing can be meaningfully associated?\n\n\nThis is the invitation to the Holy Spirit. I told you that I could\nreach up and bring the Holy Spirit down to you. But I can bring Him to you only\nat your own invitation. The Holy Spirit is nothing more than your own right mind.\nHe was also mine. The Bible says, “May the mind be in you that was also in Christ\nJesus,” and uses this as a BLESSING. It is the blessing of miracle-mindedness. It\nasks that you may think as I thought, joining with me in Christ-thinking.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity which is\nsymbolic. He is referred to in the Bible as the Healer, the Comforter, and the\nGuide. He is also described as something separate, apart from the Father and from\nthe Son. I myself said, “and if I go I will send you ANOTHER comforter, and he\nwill abide with you.”\n\nThe Holy Spirit is a difficult concept to grasp, precisely because it\nIS symbolic, and therefore open to many different interpretations. As a man and\nas one of God's creations, my right thinking, which came from the Universal\nInspiration which IS the Holy Spirit, taught me first and foremost that this\nInspiration is for ALL. I could not have it myself without knowing that.\n\nThe word “know” is proper here, because the Holy Inspiration is so\nclose to knowledge that it calls forth, or better, allows it to come. We have\nspoken before of the higher or true perception, which is so close to truth that\nGod Himself can flow across the little gap. Knowledge is always ready to flow\neverywhere, but it cannot oppose. Therefore you can obstruct it, although you can\nnever lose it.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Christ mind that senses the knowledge that lies\nbeyond perception. It came into being with the separation as a protection, and\ninspired the beginning of the Atonement at the same time. Before that, there was\nno need for healing and no-one was comfortless.",

    "content": "The Mind of the Atonement\n\nGod honored even the miscreations of His Children because they had\nmade them. But he also blessed them with a way of thinking about them that could\nraise their perceptions until they became so lofty that they could reach almost\nback to Him.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the mind of the Atonement. It represents a state of\nmind that comes close enough to one-mindedness that transfer is at last possible.\nAs you well know, transfer depends on common elements in the old learning and the\nnew situation to which it is transferred.\nPerception is not knowledge, but it can be TRANSFERRED to knowledge, or CROSS\nOVER into it. It might even be more helpful here to use the literal meaning\n“carried over,” for the last step is taken by God.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, the shared Inspiration of all the Sonship, induces a\nkind of perception in which many elements are like those in the Kingdom of Heaven\nItself.\n\nFirst, its universality is perfectly clear, and no-one who receives it\ncould ever believe for one instant that sharing it involves anything BUT gain.\n\nSecond, it is incapable of attack, and is therefore truly open. This\nmeans that although it does not engender knowledge, it does not obstruct it in\nany way. Third, it is an unequivocal call to love. Every other voice is still.\n\nThere is a point at which sufficient quantitative changes produce real\nqualitative differences. The next point requires real understanding, because it\nis the point at which the shift occurs.\n\nFinally, it points the way beyond the healing which it brings, and\nleads the mind beyond its own integration into the paths of creation.\n\nHealing is not creating; it is reparation. The Holy Spirit promotes\nhealing by looking beyond it, to what the children of God were before healing was\nneeded, and will be when they have BEEN healed. This alteration of the time\nsequence should be quite familiar, because it is very similar to the shift in\ntime perception which the miracle introduces.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the MOTIVATION for miracle-mindedness. It is the\nwill to HEAL the separation by letting it go. It is IN you because God placed it\nin your mind, and although you can keep it asleep you cannot obliterate it. God\nHimself keeps it alive by transmitting it from His Mind to yours as long as there\nis time. It is partly His will and partly yours. The miracle itself is just this\nfusion or union of will between Father and Son.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Joy. It is the call to return, with\nwhich God blessed the minds of the separated Sons. This the vocation of the mind.\nIt had no calling until the separation, because before it had only BEING, and\nwould not have understood the call to right thinking. The Holy\nSpirit was God's answer to the separation, the means by which the Atonement could\nrepair until the whole mind returned to creating. The Atonement and the\nseparation began at the same time. When man made the ego, God placed in him the\ncall of joy. This call is so strong that the ego always dissolves at its sound.\n\nThat is why you can choose to listen to two voices within you. One you\nmade yourself, and that one is not of God. But the other is given you by God, Who\nasks you only to listen to it. The Holy Spirit IS in you in a very literal sense.\nIt is the voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again.",

    "content": "The Voice for God\n\nIt is possible even in this world to hear ONLY that voice and no\nother. It takes effort and great willingness to learn. It is the final lesson\nthat I learned, and God's Sons are as equal as learners as they are as Souls. The\nvoice of the Holy Spirit IS the call to Atonement, or the restoration of the\nintegrity of the mind. When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is\nhealed, there will be no call to return, but what God creates is eternal. The\nHoly Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to bless THEIR creations and keep\nthem in the light of joy.\n\nYou ARE the Kingdom of Heaven, but you have let the belief in darkness\nenter your minds, and so you need a new light. The Holy Spirit is the radiance\nthat you must let to banish the idea of darkness. His is the glory before which\ndissociation falls away, and the Kingdom of Heaven breaks through into its own.\n\nBefore the separation you did not need guidance. You KNEW as you will\nknow again, but you do not know now. God does not guide, because He can share\nonly PERFECT KNOWLEDGE. Guidance is EVALUATIVE, because it implies that there is\na RIGHT way and also a WRONG way, one to be chosen and the other avoided. By\nchoosing one, you give up the other. This IS a conflict state. It MEANS that\nknowledge has been lost, because knowledge is SURE.\n\nGod is not in you; YOU are part of HIM. When you willed to leave Him,\nHe gave you a voice to speak FOR Him, because He could no longer share His\nknowledge with you without hindrance. Direct communication was broken, because\nyou had made another voice through another will. The Holy Spirit calls you both\nto remember and forget. You have chosen to be in a state of opposition, in which\nopposites are possible. As a result, there ARE choices which you must make. In\nthe holy state, the will is free in the sense that its CREATIVE power is\nunlimited, but choice itself is meaningless.\n\nFreedom to choose is the same POWER as freedom to create, but its\nAPPLICATION is different. Choosing MEANS divided will. The Holy Spirit is one way\nof choosing. This way is in you BECAUSE there is also another way. God did not\nleave His Children comfortless, even though they left Him. The voice they put in\ntheir minds was NOT the voice of His Will, for which the Holy Spirit speaks. The\ncall to return is stronger than the call to depart, but it speaks in a different\nway.\n\nThe voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because it is incapable\nof arrogance. It does not demand, because it does not seek control. It does not\novercome, because it does not attack. It merely REMINDS. It is compelling only\nbecause of what it reminds you OF. It brings to your mind the OTHER way,\nremaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you have made for yourselves.\nThe voice for God is always quiet, because it speaks of peace. Yet peace is\nstronger than war, because it heals. War is DIVISION, not increase. No-one gains\nfrom strife.\n\n“What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own\nSoul?” This means that if he listens to the wrong voice, he has LOST SIGHT of his\nSoul. He CANNOT lose it, but he CAN not know it. It is therefore LOST TO HIM,\nuntil he chooses right. The Holy Spirit is your guide in choosing. He is the part\nof your mind which ALWAYS speaks for the right choice, because he speaks for God.\nHe is your remaining communication with God, which you can interrupt, but cannot\ndestroy.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the way in which God's will can be done on earth as\nit is in Heaven. Both Heaven and Earth are in YOU, because the call of both are\nin your wills, and therefore in your minds. The voice for God comes from your own\naltars to Him. These altars are not THINGS. They are DEVOTIONS.\nBut you have other devotions now. Your divided devotion has given you the two\nvoices, and you must choose at which altar you will to serve. The call you answer\nnow IS an evaluation, because it is a DECISION. The decision itself is very\nsimple. It is made on the basis of which call is worth more to you.\n\nMy mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals.\nIt was only my DECISION that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. My only gift\nto you is to help you make the same decision FOR YOURSELF. The will for this\ndecision is the will to SHARE it, because the decision itself IS the decision to\nshare. It is MADE BY GIVING, and is therefore the one act of mind that resembles\ntrue creation.\n\nYou understand the role of models in the learning process, and the\nimportance of the models you value and choose to follow in determining what you\nwill to learn. I am your model for decision. By deciding for God, I showed you\nthat this decision CAN be made, and that YOU can make it. I promised you that the\nmind that made the decision for me is also in YOU, and that you can let it change\nyou just as it changed me. This mind is unequivocal, because it hears only ONE\nVOICE, and answers in ONE WAY.\n\nYou are the light of the world with me. Rest does not come from\nsleeping, but from waking. The Holy Spirit is the call to awake and be glad. The\nworld is very tired, because it is the IDEA of weariness. Our task is the joyous\none of waking it to the call for God. Everyone will answer the call of the Holy\nSpirit, or the Sonship cannot be as one. What better vocation could there be for\nany part of the Kingdom than to restore it to the perfect integration that can\nmake it whole?\n\nHear only this through the Holy Spirit within you, and teach your\nbrothers to listen as I am teaching you. When you are tempted by the wrong voice,\ncall on me to remind you how to heal by sharing my decision and MAKING IT\nSTRONGER. As we share this goal, we increase its power to attract the whole\nSonship, and to bring it back into the Oneness in which it was created.\n\nRemember that “Yolk” means “join together,” and “burden” means\nmessage. Let us reconsider the biblical statement “my yolk is easy and my burden\nlight” in this way. Let us join together, for my message is Light.\nI came to your minds because you had grown vaguely aware of the fact that there\nis another way, or another voice. Having given this invitation to the Holy\nSpirit, I could come to provide the model for HOW TO THINK.\n\nPsychology has become the study of BEHAVIOR, but no-one denies the\nbasic law that behavior is a response to MOTIVATION, and motivation is will. I\nhave enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same mind to\ndo this. This mind is the Holy Spirit, whose will is for God always. It teaches\nyou how to keep me as the model for your thought, and behave like me as a result.\n\nThe power of our joint motivation is beyond belief, but NOT beyond",

This relationship MUST be in His mind,\nbecause unless it were, the separation between the two ways of thinking would not\nbe open to healing.

If you are\npart of God, it is also the idea of YOURSELF, as well as of all the parts of God.\nThe idea of the Holy Spirit shares the property of other ideas, because it\nfollows the laws of the universe of which IT is a part. Therefore, it is\nstrengthened by being given away. It increases in YOU as you give it to your\nbrothers.\n\nSince thoughts do not have to be conscious to exist, your brother does\nNOT have to be AWARE of the Holy Spirit, either in himself or in you for this\nmiracle to occur. He may have dissociated the call for God, just as YOU have. But\nthe dissociation is healed in BOTH of you as you see it in him, and thus\nacknowledge its BEING. Bill, who has made a number of vital contributions to our\njoint venture, made a major one a while ago, which he himself did not appreciate\nor even understand. If we recognize its value together, we will be able to use it\ntogether, because it is an idea,\nand must therefore be shared to be held.\n\nWhen Bill said that he was determined “NOT to see you that way,” he\nwas speaking negatively. If he will state the same idea POSITIVELY, he will see\nthe POWER of what he said. He had realized that there are two ways of seeing you,\nand also that they are diametrically opposed to one another. These two ways must\nbe in HIS mind, because he was referring to HIMSELF as the perceiver. They must\nalso be in YOURS, because he was perceiving YOU.\n\nWhat he was really saying was that he would NOT look at you through\nHIS ego, or perceive YOUR ego in you. Stated positively, he would see you through\nthe Holy Spirit in HIS mind, and perceive it in YOURS. What you acknowledge in\nyour brother, you ARE acknowledging in yourself. What you share you STRENGTHEN.\nThe voice of the Holy Spirit IS weak in you. That is why you MUST share it,\nbecause it must be INCREASED in strength before YOU can hear it. It is impossible\nto hear it in yourself while it is so weak in your OWN mind. It is NOT weak in\nitself; but it IS limited by your unwillingness to hear it.\n\nWill itself is an idea, and is therefore strengthened by being shared.\nYou have made the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in YOURSELVES, and that\nis why your meditations have frightened you. By adopting the ego's viewpoint, you\nundertook an ego-alien journey WITH THE EGO AS GUIDE. This was BOUND to produce\nfear. Bill's better idea needs to be strengthened in BOTH of you. Since it was\nHIS, HE can increase it by giving it to you.\n\nDelay is of the ego, because time is ITS concept. Delay is obviously a\nTIME idea. Both time AND delay are meaningless in eternity. We have said before\nthat the Holy Spirit is God's answer to the ego. Everything of which the Holy\nSpirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego's notions, because true and\nfalse perceptions are THEMSELVES opposed. The Holy Spirit has the task of UNDOING\nwhat the ego has made. It must undo it in the same realm of discourse in which\nthe ego itself operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the change. We\nhave repeatedly emphasized the fact that one level of the mind is not\nunderstandable to another. So it is with the ego and the soul, and with time and\neternity.\n\nEternity is an idea of God, so the soul understands it perfectly. Time\nis a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which IS the ego's domain, accepts it\nwithout question. The only aspect of time which is really eternal is NOW. That is\nwhat we REALLY mean when we say that now is the only time. The literal nature of\nthis statement does not mean anything to the ego. It interprets it, at best, to\nmean “don't worry about the future.” This is NOT what it really means at all.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the mediator between the interpretations of the ego\nand the knowledge of the Soul. Its ability to deal with symbols enables it to\nwork AGAINST the ego's beliefs in its own language. Its equal ability to look\nBEYOND symbols into eternity also enables it to understand the laws of God, for\nwhich it speaks.\n\nIt can thus perform the function of RE-INTERPRETING what the ego\nmakes, not by destruction, but by understanding. Understanding is light, and\nlight leads to knowledge. The Holy Spirit is IN light, because it is IN YOU who\nARE light. But you yourselves do not know this. It is therefore the task of the\nHoly Spirit to re-interpret you on behalf of God.\n\nYou cannot understand yourselves alone. This is because you have no\nmeaning apart from your rightful place in the Sonship, and the rightful place of\nthe Sonship in God. This is your life, your eternity, and YOURSELF. It is of this\nthat the Holy Spirit reminds you. It is this that the Holy Spirit SEES. This\nvision invariably frightens the ego, because it is so calm. Peace is the ego's\ngreatest enemy, because according to ITS interpretation of reality, war is the\nguarantee of its survival. The ego becomes strong in strife because if you\nbelieve there is strife, you will react viciously because the idea of danger has\nentered your mind. This idea itself IS an appeal to the ego.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is as vigilant as the ego to the call of danger,\nopposing it with ITS strength just as the ego WELCOMES it with all its might. The\nHoly Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace. Peace and eternity are as\nclosely related as are time and war. Perception as well as knowledge derive\nmeaning from RELATIONSHIPS. Those which you accept are the foundations of your\nbeliefs.\n\nThe Separation is merely another term for a split mind. It was not an\nact, but a thought. Therefore, the idea of Separation can be given away, just as\nthe idea of unity can, and either way, it will be STRENGTHENED IN THE MIND OF THE\nGIVER. The ego is the symbol of the Separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the\nsymbol of peace. What you perceive in others you are STRENGTHENING IN YOUR SELF.\nYou let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your mind re-interpret\nits own misperceptions. The Holy Spirit is the perfect teacher. It uses only what\nyour minds ALREADY understand, to teach you that you do not understand it.\n\nThe Holy Spirit can deal with an unwilling learner without going\ncounter to his will, because part of his will IS still for God. Despite the ego's\nattempts to conceal this part, it is still much stronger than the ego, even\nthough the ego does not recognize it. The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly,\nbecause it is its own dwelling place, or the place in the mind where it is at\nhome. YOU are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace, and peace is of\nGod.\n\nYou who are part of God are not at home EXCEPT in His peace. If peace\nis eternal, you are at home only in eternity. The ego made the world as IT\nperceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the RE-INTERPRETER of what the ego made, sees\nit only as a teaching device for bringing you home. The Holy Spirit must perceive\ntime and re-interpret into the timeless. The mind must be led into eternity\nTHROUGH time, because having made time it is capable of perceiving its opposite.\n\nThe Holy Spirit must work through opposites, because it must work with\nand for a mind that IS in opposition. Correct and learn, and be open to learning.\nYou have NOT made truth, but truth can still set you free. Look as the Holy\nSpirit looks, and understand as He understands. His understanding looks back to\nGod, in remembrance of Me. He is in Holy Communion always, and He is part of YOU.",

    "content": "Therapy and Teaching\n\nYou must have noticed how often I have used your own ideas to help\nYOU. B. is right is saying that you have learned to be a loving, wise, and very\nunderstanding therapist, except for yourself. That exception has given you more\nthan perception for others because of what you saw in them, but less than\nknowledge of your real relationships TO them because you did NOT make them part\nOF you. Understanding IS beyond perception, because it introduces meaning. But it\nis below knowledge, even though it can grow TOWARDS it. It is possible, with\ngreat effort, to understand someone else and to be helpful to him, but the effort\nis misdirected. The misdirection is quite apparent. It is directed AWAY from you.\n\nThis does NOT mean that it is lost to you, but it DOES mean that you\nare not aware of it. I have saved all of your kindnesses and every loving thought\nyou have had, and I assure you, you have had many. I have purified them of errors\nwhich hid their light, and have kept them for you in their own perfect radiance.\nThey are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They came from the Holy Spirit\nwithin YOU, and we know that what God creates is eternal.\n\nBill once spoke of the Kingdom in this way, because he yearns for what\nhe has repressed. You are much more afraid of it, because dissociation is more\nfearful. B's better contact has allowed him the strength to retain the fear in\nawareness, and to resort to displacement, which he is learning to overcome with\nYOUR help. That is because you do not perceive HIM as dissociated, and can help\nhim with his repression,\nwhich does not frighten you. He, on the other hand, has no difficulty in seeing\nYOU dissociate, and does not have to deal with repression in you, which WOULD\nproduce fear in him.\n\nJoining in Atonement, which I have repeatedly asked you to do, is\nALWAYS a way OUT of fear. This does not mean that you can safely fail to\nacknowledge anything that is true, but the Holy Spirit will not fail to help you\nre-interpret EVERYTHING that you perceive as fearful, and teach you ONLY what is\nloving IS true. It is beyond your ability to destroy, but entirely within your\ngrasp. It BELONGS to you because YOU created it. It is yours because it is part\nof you, just as you are part of God, because He created you.\n\nThe Atonement is the GUARANTEE of the safety of the Kingdom. Nothing\ngood is lost, because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the voice for Creation.\nNothing that is not good was ever created, and therefore CANNOT be protected.\nWhat the ego makes it KEEPS TO ITSELF, and so it is without strength. Its\nunshared existence does not die. It was merely never born. Real birth is not a\nbeginning; it is a CONTINUING. Everything that CAN continue has already BEEN\nborn. But it can INCREASE as you are willing to return the part of your mind that\nneeds healing to the higher part, and thus render your creating (creation)\nundivided.\n\nYou yourself always told your patients that the real difference\nbetween neurotic and ‘healthy’ guilt feelings was that neurotic guilt feelings DO\nNOT HELP ANYONE. This distinction was very wise, though incomplete. Let us make\nthe distinction a little sharper now. 􀃆\nNeurotic guilt feelings are a device of the ego for “atoning” without sharing,\nand for asking for pardon without change. The ego NEVER calls for real atonement,\nand cannot tolerate real forgiveness, which IS change.\n\nYour concept of “healthy guilt feelings” has great merit, but without\nthe concept of the Atonement it lacked the healing potential it held. YOU make\nthe distinction in terms of feelings which led to a decision not to REPEAT the\nerror, which is only PART of healing. Your concept therefore lacked the idea of\nUNDOING it. What you were really advocating, then, was adopting a policy of\nsharing without a real FOUNDATION.\n\nI have come to give you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make\nyou REALLY free. You have carried the burden of the ideas you did NOT share, and\nwhich were therefore too weak to increase, but you did NOT recognize how to UNDO\ntheir existence because you HAD made them. You CANNOT cancel out your past errors\nalone. They will NOT disappear from your mind without remedy. The remedy is NOT\nof your making, any more than YOU are.\n\nThe Atonement cannot be understood except as a PURE ACT OF SHARING.\nThat is what is meant when we said that it is possible even in this world to\nlisten to ONE voice. If you are part of God, and the Sonship is one, you CANNOT\nbe limited to the self the ego sees. Every loving thought held in ANY part (of\nthe Sonship) belongs to every part.\nIt is shared BECAUSE it is loving. Sharing is God's way of creating, and also\nYOURS. Your ego can keep you in exile FROM the Kingdom but in the Kingdom itself\nit has no power.\n\nYou have become willing to receive my messages as I give them, without\ninterference by the ego, so we can clarify an earlier point which was mentioned\nbefore. We said that you will one day teach as much as you learn, and that will\nkeep you in balance. The time is now, because you have let it be now. You cannot\nlearn EXCEPT by teaching. I heard one voice because I had learned that learning\nis attained BY teaching. I understood that I COULD NOT ATONE FOR MYSELF ALONE.\n\nListening to one voice MEANS the will to share the voice to hear it\nyourself. The mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to every mind\ncreated by God, because God's wholeness IS the wholeness of his Son. Turning the\nother cheek does NOT mean that you should submit to violence without protest. It\nmeans that you cannot be hurt, and do not want to show your brother anything\nexcept your wholeness. Show him that he CANNOT hurt you, and hold nothing against\nhim, or you hold it against yourself.\n\nTeaching is done in many ways, by formal means, by guidance, and above\nall BY EXAMPLE. If you will to learn, you MUST will to teach. Teaching is therapy\nbecause it means the sharing of ideas, and the awareness that to share them is to\nstrengthen them. The union of the Sonship IS its protection.\nThe ego cannot prevail against the Kingdom BECAUSE it is united, and the ego\nfades away and is undone in the presence of the attraction of the parts of the\nSonship which hear the call of the Holy Spirit to be as One.\n\nI cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned which arose in me\nBECAUSE I learned it. I call upon you to teach what you have learned, because by\nso doing YOU can depend on it. Make it dependable in my name, because my name is\nthe name of God's Son. What I learned I give you freely, and the mind which was\nin me rejoices as YOU will to hear it. The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by\nUNDOING, and thus lifts the burden you have placed in your mind. By following\nHim, He leads you back to God where you belong. And how can you find this way\nexcept by taking your brother with you?\n\nMy part in the Atonement is not complete until YOU join it, and give\nit away. As you teach, so shall you learn. I will never leave you or forsake you,\nbecause to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God who created me. You\nwill forsake yourselves and your God if you forsake any of YOUR brothers. You are\nmore than your brother's keeper. In fact, you do not WANT to keep him. You must\nlearn to see him as he is, and KNOW that he belongs to God, as you do. How could\nyou treat your brother better than by rendering unto God the things which are\nGod's?\n\nIdeas do not LEAVE the mind which thought them in order to have\nseparate being. Nor do separate thoughts conflict with one another in space,\nbecause they do not occupy space at all.\nHUMAN ideas can conflict in content, because they occur at different levels, and\ninclude opposite thoughts at the SAME level. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SHARE OPPOSING\nTHOUGHTS. The Holy Spirit does not LET you forsake your brothers. Therefore, you\ncan really share only the parts of your thoughts which are of Him, which He also\nkeeps for YOU. And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. All the rest remains with\nyou until He has re-interpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them,\ntoo, worthy of being shared. When they have been sufficiently purified, He lets\nyou give them away. The will to share them IS their purification.\n\nThe Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to\ncreate is of God. Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote themselves\nfirst to healing, because having RECEIVED the idea of healing they MUST give it\nto hold it. The full power of creation (creating) cannot be expressed as long as\nany of God's ideas are withholding it from the Kingdom. The joint will of ALL the\nSonship is the only creator that can create like the Father. That is because only\nthe complete can think completely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing.\nEverything YOU think that is not through the Holy Spirit IS lacking.\n\nT  F 17.How can you who are so Holy suffer? All your past, except its beauty, is\ngone, and nothing is left except a blessing. You can indeed depart in peace,\nbecause I have loved you as I loved myself. You go WITH my blessing and FOR my\nblessing. Hold it and share it, that it may always be ours. I place the peace of\nGod in your heart, and in your hands, to hold and share. The heart is pure to\nhold it, and the hands are strong to give it. We cannot lose. My judgment is as",

    "content": "The Two Decisions\n\nPerhaps this will become clearer and more personally meaningful if the\nego's use of guilt is clarified. The ego has a purpose, just as the Holy Spirit\nhas. The ego's purpose is FEAR, because only the fearful can be egotistic. The\nego's logic is as impeccable as that of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has\nall the means at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as it elects. But let\nus again remember that both are in you.\n\nIn Heaven there is no guilt, because the Kingdom is attained through\nthe Atonement, which creates it in you. The word “create” is appropriate here,\nbecause once what YOU have made is undone by the Holy Spirit, the blessed residue\nIS restored, and therefore continues in creation. What is truly blessed is\nincapable of giving rise to guilt, and must give rise to joy. This makes it\ninvulnerable to the ego, because its peace is unassailable. It is invulnerable to\ndisruption BECAUSE it is whole.\n\nGuilt is ALWAYS disruptive. Anything that engenders fear is divisive,\nbecause it obeys the law of division. If the ego is the symbol of the separation,\nit is also the symbol of guilt. Guilt is more than merely not of God. It is the\nsymbol of the ATTACK on God. This is a totally meaningless concept EXCEPT to the\nego, but do not underestimate the power of the ego's belief in it. This is the\nbelief from which ALL guilt really stems.\n\nThe ego IS the part of the mind which believes in division. But how\ncan part of God detach itself WITHOUT believing it is attacking Him? We spoke\nbefore of the authority problem as involving the concept of USURPING His power.\nThe ego believes that this is what YOU did, because it believes it IS you. It\nfollows, then, that if you identify WITH the ego, you MUST perceive yourself as\nguilty.\n\nWhenever you respond to your ego, you WILL experience guilt, and you\nWILL fear punishment. The ego is quite literally a fearful thought. And however\nridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the sane mind, never forget that\nthe ego is NOT SANE. It REPRESENTS a delusional system, and it speaks FOR it.\nListening to the ego's voice MEANS that you believe it is possible to attack God.\nYou believe that a part of Him has been torn away by YOU.\n\nThe classic picture of fear of retaliation from without then follows,\nbecause the severity of the guilt is so acute that it MUST be projected. Although\nFreud was wrong about the basic conflict itself, he was very accurate in\ndescribing its effects. Whatever you accept INTO your mind has reality for you.\nIt is, however, only the ACCEPTANCE which makes it real.\n\nAs an extreme example of dissociation yourself, you should have little\ntrouble in understanding that it is perfectly possible not to ACCEPT what IS in\nyour minds.\nIf you enthrone the ego in it, the fact that you have accepted it, or allowed it\nto enter, MAKES IT YOUR REALITY. This is because the mind as God created it IS\ncapable of creating reality. We said before that you must learn to think WITH\nGod. To think WITH Him is to think LIKE Him. This engenders joy, not guilt,\nbecause it is natural. Guilt is a sure sign that your thinking is Unnatural.\nPerverted thinking will ALWAYS be attended with guilt, because it IS the belief\nin sin.\n\nThe ego does not perceive sin as a lack of love. It perceives it as a\nPOSITIVE ACT OF ASSAULT. This is an interpretation which is necessary to its\nsurvival, because as soon as YOU regard it as a LACK, you will automatically\nattempt to remedy the situation. And you will also succeed. The ego regards this\nas doom, but YOU must learn to regard it as freedom.\n\nThe guiltless mind cannot suffer. Being sane, it heals the body\nbecause IT has been healed. The sane mind cannot conceive of illness, because it\ncannot conceive of attacking anything or anyone. We said before that illness is a\nform of magic. It might be better to say it is a form of magical SOLUTION. The\nego believes that by punishing ITSELF, it will mitigate the punishment of God.\nYet even in this it is arrogant. It attributes to God a punishing attempt, and\nthen takes over this intent as its OWN prerogative. It tries to usurp ALL the\nfunctions of God as it perceives them, because it recognizes that only total\nallegiance can be trusted.\n\nThe ego cannot OPPOSE the laws of God, any more than YOU can. But it\ncan INTERPRET them according to what it wants, just as YOU can. That is why the\nquestion “what DO you want” must be answered. You ARE answering it every minute\nand every second, and each moment of decision is a judgment which is anything BUT\nineffectual. Its effects will follow automatically UNTIL THE DECISION IS CHANGED.\nThis is a redundant statement, because you have NOT learned it. But again, any\ndecision can be Unmade as well as made.\n\nBut remember that the ALTERNATIVES are unalterable. The Holy Spirit,\nlike the ego, is a decision. Together they constitute all the alternatives which\nyour mind CAN accept and obey. The ego and the Holy Spirit are the ONLY choices\nwhich are open to you. God created one, and so you cannot eradicate it. YOU made\nthe other, so you CAN. Only what God creates is irreversible and unchangeable.\nWhat YOU have made can always be changed, because when you do not think LIKE God,\nyou have not really thought at all. Delusional ideas are NOT thought, but you CAN\nthink that you believe in them.\n\nBut you are wrong. The function of thought comes FROM God and is IN\nGod. As part of HIS thought, you cannot think APART from Him. Irrational thought\nis a thought DISORDER. God Himself orders your thought, because your thought was\ncreated BY Him. Guilt feelings are always a sign that you do not know this. They also show that\nyou believe you CAN think apart from God, and WANT to.\n\nEvery thought disorder is attended by guilt at its inception, and\nMAINTAINED by guilt in its continuance. Guilt is inescapable for those who\nbelieve that they order their OWN thought, and must therefore obey its orders.\nThis makes them feel RESPONSIBLE for their mind ERRORS, without recognizing that\nby ACCEPTING this responsibility they are really reacting Irresponsibly. If the\nsole responsibility of the miracle-worker is to accept the ATONEMENT, and I\nassure you that it is, then the responsibility for what is atoned FOR CANNOT be\nyours.\n\nThis contradiction cannot BE resolved except by accepting the solution\nof undoing. You WOULD be responsible for the effects of all your wrong thinking\nIF IT COULD NOT BE UNDONE. The purpose of the Atonement is to save the past in\nPURIFIED form only. If you accept the remedy FOR a thought-disorder, and a remedy",

    "content": "Time and Eternity\n\nThe CONTINUING will to remain separated is the only possible reason\nfor continuing guilt feelings. We have said this before, but we did not emphasize\nthe destructive results of this decision at that time. ANY decision of the mind\nwill affect both behavior AND experience. And what you will you EXPECT. This is\nNOT delusional.\nYour mind DOES create your future, and CAN turn it back to full creation at any\nminute, IF IT ACCEPTS THE ATONEMENT FIRST. It will also turn back to full\ncreation the instant it has done so. Having given up its thought DISORDER, the\nproper ordering of thought becomes quite apparent.\n\nGod in His knowledge is not waiting. But His Kingdom IS bereft while\nYOU wait. All the Sons of God are waiting for your return, just as YOU are\nwaiting for THEIRS. Delay does not matter in eternity, but it IS tragic in time.\nYou have elected to be in time rather than in eternity, and have therefore\nchanged your belief in your status. But election is both free and alterable. You\ndo NOT belong in time. Your place is ONLY in eternity, where God Himself placed\nyou forever.\n\nGuilt feelings are the PRESERVERS of time. They induce fears of FUTURE\nretaliation or abandonment, and thus ensure that the future will remain like the\npast. This IS the ego's continuity, and gives it a false sense of security\nthrough the belief that you cannot escape from it. But you can and MUST. God\noffers you the continuity of eternity in exchange. When you will to make this\nexchange, you will simultaneously exchange guilt for peace, viciousness for love,\nand pain for joy.\n\nMy role is only to unchain your will and make it free. Your egos\ncannot accept this freedom, and will oppose your free decision at every possible\nmoment, and in every possible way.\nAnd as its maker, you KNOW what it can do, because you GAVE IT the ability to do\nit. The mind does indeed know its power, because the mind does indeed know God.\nRemember the Kingdom always, and remember that you who are part of it cannot BE\nlost. The mind that was in me IS in you, for God creates with perfect fairness.\nLet the Holy Spirit remind you always of His fairness, and let me teach you how\nto share it with your brothers. How else can the chance to claim it for yourself\nbe given you?\n\nWhat you do not understand is that the two voices speak for different\ninterpretations of the same thing simultaneously, or almost simultaneously, for\nthe ego always speaks first. Alternate interpretations are unnecessary until the\nfirst one has been made, and speaking itself was unnecessary before the ego was\nmade. The ego speaks in judgment, and the Holy Spirit reverses its decisions,\nmuch as the Supreme Court has the power to reverse the lower court's decision\nabout the laws of this world.\n\nThe ego's decisions are ALWAYS wrong, because they are based on a\ncomplete fallacy which they are made to uphold. NOTHING it perceives is\ninterpreted correctly. Not only does it cite scripture for its purpose, but it\neven interprets scripture as a witness for itself. The Bible is a fearful thing\nto the ego, because of its prejudiced judgment. Perceiving it as fearful, it\ninterprets it fearfully. Having made YOU afraid, you do not appeal to the higher\ncourt, because you believe its judgment would be AGAINST you.\n\nWe need cite only a few examples to see how the ego's interpretations\nhave mislead you. A favorite ego quotation is “As ye sow, so shall ye reap.”\nAnother is “Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord.” Still another is “I will visit\nthe sins of the fathers unto the third and the fourth generation.” And also, “The\nwicked shall perish.” There are many others, but if you will let the Holy Spirit\nre-interpret these in its own light, they will suffice.\n\n“As ye sow, so shall ye reap” merely means that what you believe to be\nworth cultivating you will cultivate in yourself. Your judgment of what is worthy\nDOES make it worthy for you.\n\n“Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord” is easily explained if you\nremember that ideas increase only by being shared. This quotation therefore\nemphasizes the fact that vengeance CANNOT be shared. Give it therefore to the\nHoly Spirit, who will undo it in you because it does not BELONG in your mind,\nwhich is part of God.\n\n“I will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth\ngeneration,” as interpreted by the ego, is particularly vicious. It is used, in\nfact, as an attempt to guarantee its survival beyond itself. Actually, all it\nreally means is that the Holy Spirit in later generations retains the power to\ninterpret CORRECTLY what former generations have thought, and thus release THEIR\nthoughts from the ability to produce fear ANYWHERE in the Sonship.\n\n“The wicked shall perish” is merely a statement of fact, if the word\n“perish” is properly understood. Every loveless thought MUST be undone, and even\nthe word “undone” is fearful to the ego, which interprets “I am undone” as “I am\ndestroyed.” The ego will NOT be destroyed, because it is part of YOUR thought.\nBut because it is uncreative, and therefore unsharing, it WILL be re-interpreted\nentirely, to release you from fear.\n\nThe part of your thought which you have given TO the ego will merely\nreturn to the Kingdom, where your whole mind BELONGS. The ego is a form of\nARREST, but arrest is merely delay. It does NOT involve the concept of police at\nall, although the ego welcomes that interpretation. You CAN delay the completion\nof the Kingdom, but you CANNOT introduce the concept of ASSAULT into it.\n\nWhen I said “I am come as a light into the world,” I surely came to\nshare this light with you. Remember the symbolic reference we made before to the\nego's dark glass, and remember also that we said “Do not look there.” It is still\ntrue that “Where you look to find yourself is up to you.” The Higher Court will\nnot condemn you. It will merely dismiss the case against you. There can BE no\ncase against a child of God, and every witness to guilt in God's creations is\nbearing false witness to God Himself.\n\nAppeal everything you believe gladly to God's own Higher Court, because\nit speaks for Him, and therefore speaks truly. It WILL dismiss the case against\nyou, however carefully YOU have built it.\nThe case may be fool-proof, but it is NOT God-proof. The voice for God will not\nhear it at all, because it can only witness truly. Its verdict will always be\n“Thine is the Kingdom,” because it was given you to remind you of what you ARE.\n\nYour patience with each other is your patience with your selves. Is\nnot a child of God worth patience? I have shown you infinite patience, because my\nwill IS that of our Father, from whom I learned of infinite patience. His voice\nwas in me, as it is in you, speaking for patience towards the Sonship, in the\nname of its Creator. What you need to learn now is that only infinite patience\nCAN produce immediate effects. This is the way in which time is exchanged for\neternity. Infinite patience calls upon infinite Love, and by producing results\nNOW renders time unnecessary.\n\nTo say that time is temporary is merely redundant. We have repeatedly\nsaid that time is a learning device which will be abolished when it is no longer\nuseful. The Holy Spirit, who speaks for God in time, also knows that time is\nmeaningless. He reminds you of this in every passing moment of time, because it\nis His special function to return YOU to eternity and remain to bless YOUR",

    "content": "The Eternal Fixation\n\nThe concept of “set” is among the better psychological percepts.\nActually, it is used quite frequently in the Bible, and also here, under many\ndifferent terms. “God will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed (or\nset) on Thee because he trusteth in Thee.”\n\nThe pronouns here are confusing without explanation, and the attempt\nto shift “Thee” to “Him” is a misinterpretation. The statement means that God's\npeace is set in the Holy Spirit, because it is fixed on God. It is also fixed in\nyou. You, then, ARE fixed in the peace of God.\n\nThe concept of “fixation” is a very helpful one, which Freud\nunderstood perfectly. Unfortunately, he lost his understanding because he was\nafraid, and as you know all too well, fear is incompatible with good judgment.\nFear DISTORTS thinking, and therefore DISorders thought. Freud's system of\nthought was extremely ingenious, because Freud was extremely ingenious. A mind\nMUST endow its thoughts with its own attributes. This is its inherent STRENGTH,\neven though it may misuse its power.\n\nFreud lost much of the potential value of his own thought system\nbecause, much like Cayce, he did NOT include himself in it. This IS a dissociated\nstate, because the thinker cuts himself off from his thoughts. Freud's thought\nwas so conflicted that he could not have retained his sanity as HE saw it WITHOUT\ndissociating. This is why the many contradictions which are quite apparent in his thinking became increasingly less apparent to HIM.\n\nA man who knows what fixation REALLY means and does NOT yield to it is\nterribly afraid. Fixation is the pull of God, on whom your mind IS fixed because\nof the Holy Spirit's irrevocable set. “Irrevocable” means “cannot be called back\nor redirected.” The irrevocable nature of the Holy Spirit's set is the basis for\nits unequivocal voice. The Holy Spirit NEVER changes its mind. Clarity of thought\nCANNOT occur under conditions of vacillation. Unless a mind is fixed in its\npurpose, it is NOT clear. But clarity literally means the state of light, and\nenlightenment IS understanding. It stands UNDER perception because you have\ndenied it as the REAL foundation of thought. This is the basis for ALL delusional\nsystems.\n\nThe concept of fixation, as Freud saw it, has a number of real\nlearning advantages. First, it recognizes that man CAN be fixated at a point in\ndevelopment which does NOT accord with a point in time. This clearly could have\nbeen a means toward real release from the time belief, had Freud pursued it with\nan open mind. But Freud suffered all his life from refusal to allow eternity to\ndawn upon his mind, and enlighten it truly. As a result, he overlooked NOW\nentirely, and merely saw the continuity of past and future.\n\nSecond, although he misinterpreted what the Holy Spirit told him, or\nbetter, reminded him of, he was too honest to deny more than he had to, to keep\nhis fear in tolerable bounds, as he perceived the situation. Therefore, he\nEMPHASIZED that the point in development at which the mind is fixated is more\nreal to ITSELF than the external reality with which it DISagrees.\nThis again could have been a powerful RELEASE mechanism, had Freud not decided to\ninvolve it in a strong defense system because he perceived it as an attack.\n\nThird, although Freud interpreted fixation as irrevocable danger\npoints to which the mind can always regress, the concept can also be interpreted\nas an irrevocable call to sanity which the mind cannot LOSE. Freud saw return as\na threat to maturity because he did not understand prodigality. He merely\ninterpreted it as squandering. Actually, “prodigal” also means careful. This\nconfusion between careful and careless led him to confuse the escape from care\nwith something desirable. In fact, he even went so far as to equate it quite\nliterally WITH desire.\n\nBut throughout his thought-system, the “threat” of fixation remained,\nand could never be completely eliminated by any living human being anywhere.\nEssentially, this was the basis of his pessimism. This was personally as well as\ntheoretically the case. Freud tried every means his very inventive mind could\ndevise to set up a form of therapy which could enable the mind to escape from\nfixation forever, even though he KNEW this was impossible. The knowledge plagued\nhis belief in his own thought-system at every turn, because he was both an honest\nman and a healer. He was therefore only PARTIALLY insane at the perceptual level,\nand was unable to relinquish the hope of release even though he could not cope\nwith [it]\\*.\n\nThe reason for this amount of detail is because YOU are in the same\nposition. You were eternally fixated on God in your creation, and the pull of\nthis fixation is so strong that you will never overcome it. The reason is\nperfectly clear. The fixation is on a level that is so high that it cannot BE\nsurmounted. You are ALWAYS being pulled back to your Creator because you belong\nin Him.\n\nDo you REALLY believe you can make a voice that can drown out His? Do\nyou REALLY believe that you can devise a thought-system which can separate you\nfrom His? Do you REALLY believe that you can plan for your safety and joy better\nthan He can? You need be neither careful nor careless. You need merely cast all\nyour cares upon Him because He careth for YOU. You ARE His care because He loves\nyou. His voice reminds you always that all hope is yours BECAUSE of His care.\n\nYou CANNOT choose to escape His care, because that is not His will.\nBut you CAN choose to accept His care, and use the infinite power OF His care for\nall those He created BY it. There have been many healers who did not heal\nthemselves. They have not moved mountains by their faith because their faith was\nnot WHOLE. Some of them have healed the sick at times, but they have not raised\nthe dead. Unless the healer heals HIMSELF, he does NOT believe that there is no\norder in miracles. He has not learned that EVERY mind that God created is equally\nworthy of being healed because GOD CREATED IT WHOLE.\n\nYou are asked merely to return to God the mind as HE created it. He\nasks you only for what He gave, knowing that this giving will heal YOU. Sanity IS\nwholeness. And the sanity of your brothers IS yours. Why should you listen to the\nendless insane calls which you think are made upon you, when you KNOW the voice\nof God Himself is in you? God commended His Spirit to you, and asks that you\ncommend yours to Him. He wills to keep it in perfect peace because you are of one\nmind and Spirit with Him.\n\nExcluding yourself from the Atonement is the ego's last-ditch defense\nof its own existence. It reflects both the ego's need to separate, and your\nwillingness to side with its separateness. This willingness means that YOU DO NOT\nWANT TO BE HEALED. When I told Bill that there is “just one more thing,” he heard\nme very well. I hope he will hear me as well now. His intelligent mis-hearing of\n“river” as “rivet” showed that, even though he wanted release, he was not able to\ncope with it at the time.\n\nBut the time IS now. You have not been asked to work out the Plan of\nSalvation yourselves, because, as I told you before, the Remedy is NOT of your\nmaking. God Himself gave you the perfect correction for everything you have made\nwhich is not in accord with His Holy Will. I have made His Plan perfectly clear\nand perfectly explicit to you, and have also told you of your part in His Plan\nand how urgent it is that you fulfill it.\n\nThere is time for delay, but there need not be. God weeps at the\nsacrifice of His children who believe they are lost to Him. The “one more thing”\nthat Bill must learn is merely that he is NOT the one more. He is both ONE and AT\nONE. If he will learn this NOW, he will be willing in accord with the last\njudgment, which is really only the Biblical reminder of the inevitability of\nself-INCLUSION. This is what “Physician, heal thyself” really means. Bill has\nfrequently observed for HIMSELF that this is hard to do. He has, however, been\nperfectly aware of\nJUST what YOU should do about it.\n\nYou might ask him for me whether he does not think he might be\ndissociating HIMSELF from his own awareness, since he is so clear about the\nremedy for YOU. You might also remind him that to whatever extent he separates\nhimself from you, he is separating himself from ME. This IS a collaborative\nventure. Let me therefore return his own ideas to him, so that you can share them\nand thus help each other to help me.\n\nBut let me first remind you of something I told you myself. Whenever\nyou are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to\nsome Soul which God created. Perceiving this as sin, you become defensive because\nyou EXPECT ATTACK. The decision to react in that way, however, was YOURS, and can\ntherefore be undone. It CANNOT be undone by repentance in the usual sense,\nbecause this implies guilt. If you allow yourself to feel guilty, you will\nreinforce the error, rather than allowing it to be undone FOR you.\n\nDecisions CANNOT be difficult. This is obvious if you realize that you\nmust ALREADY have made a decision NOT to be wholly joyous if that is what you\nfeel. Therefore, the first step in the undoing is to recognize that YOU ACTIVELY\nDECIDED WRONGLY, BUT CAN AS ACTIVELY DECIDE OTHERWISE.\n\nBe very firm with yourselves in this, and keep yourselves fully aware\nof the fact that the UNDOING process, which does NOT come from you, is\nnevertheless WITHIN you because God placed it there. YOUR part is merely to\nreturn your thinking to the point at which the error was made, and give it over\nto the Atonement in peace. Say to yourselves the following, as sincerely as you\ncan, remembering that the Holy Spirit will respond fully to your slightest\ninvitation:\n\nI must have decided wrongly because I am NOT at peace.\n\nI made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise.\n\nI WILL to decide otherwise, because I WANT to be at peace.\n\nI do NOT feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo ALL the consequences of my wrong decision IF I WILL LET HIM.\n\nI WILL to let Him by allowing Him to decide for God for me.",

    "content": "The Message of the Crucifixion\n\nWe have not dwelt upon the crucifixion, because of its fearful\nconnotations. The only emphasis we laid upon it was that it was NOT a form of\npunishment. But we know that nothing can be really explained only in negative\nterms. There is a positive interpretation of the crucifixion which is wholly\ndevoid of fear, and therefore wholly benign in what it teaches, if it is properly\nunderstood. It is nothing more than an extreme example. Its value, like the value\nof any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of learning it facilitates. It\ncan be, and has been, misunderstood. But this is only because the fearful are apt\nto perceive fearfully.\n\nI told you before that you can always call on me to share my decision\nand thus MAKE IT STRONGER. I also told you that the crucifixion was the last\nfoolish journey that the Sonship need take, and that it should mean RELEASE from\nfear to anyone who understands it. While we emphasized the Resurrection only\nbefore, the purpose of the crucifixion and how it actually LED to the\nResurrection was not clarified at that time. Nevertheless, it has a definite\ncontribution to make to your own lives, and if you will consider it WITHOUT fear,\nit will help you understand your own role as teachers.\n\nYou have reacted for years AS IF you were being crucified. This is a\nmarked tendency of the separated, who ALWAYS refuse to consider what they have\ndone to THEMSELVES. Projection means anger, anger fosters assault, and assault\npromotes fear. The real meaning of the crucifixion lies in the APPARENT intensity\nof the assault of some of the Sons of God upon a brother. This, of course, is\nimpossible, and must be fully understood AS an impossibility. In fact, unless it\nIS fully understood as ONLY that, I cannot serve as a real model for learning.\n\nAssault can ultimately be made ONLY on the body. There is little doubt\nthat one BODY can assault another, and can even destroy it. But if destruction\nITSELF is impossible, then ANYTHING that is destructible cannot be real.\nTherefore, its destruction does NOT justify anger. To the extent\nto which you believe it DOES, you MUST be accepting false premises and TEACHING\nTHEM TO OTHERS. The message which the crucifixion was intended to teach was that\nit is not necessary to perceive ANY form of assault in persecution because you\ncannot BE persecuted. If you respond with anger, you MUST be equating yourself\nwith the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely. I have made\nit perfectly clear that I am like you, and you are like me. But our fundamental\nequality can be demonstrated only through joint decision.\n\nYou are free to perceive yourselves as persecuted if you chose.  But\nyou might remember when you DO choose to react that way that I WAS persecuted as\nthe world judges, and did NOT share this evaluation for myself. And because I did\nnot share it, I did NOT strengthen it. I therefore offered a DIFFERENT\ninterpretation of attack, and one which I DO want to share with you. If you will\nBELIEVE it, you will help me TEACH it.\n\nWe have said before, “As you teach so shall you learn.” If you react\nas if you are persecuted, you ARE teaching persecution. This is not a lesson\nwhich the Sons of God should WANT to teach if they are to realize their own\nsalvation. Rather teach your own perfect immunity, which IS the Truth in you, and\nKNOW that it cannot be assailed. Do not protect it yourselves, or you have\nbelieved that it IS assailable. You are not asked to BE crucified, because that\nwas part of my own teaching contribution. You are merely asked to follow my\nexample in the face of much less extreme temptations to misperceive, and NOT to\naccept them falsely as justifications for anger.\n\nThere can BE no justification for the unjustifiable. Do not believe\nthere is, and do not TEACH that there is. Remember always that what you believe\nyou WILL teach. Believe with me, and we will become equal as teachers. YOUR\nresurrection is your re-awakening. I am the model for rebirth, but rebirth itself\nis merely the dawning on your minds of what is already in them.\nGod placed it there Himself, and so it is true forever. I believed in it, and\ntherefore made it forever true for me. Help me to teach it to our brothers in the\nname of the Kingdom of God. But first believe that it is true for you, or you\nwill teach amiss.\n\nMy brothers slept during the so-called “agony in the garden,” but I\ncould not be angry with them, because I had learned I could not BE abandoned.\nPeter swore he would never deny me, but he did so three times. It should be noted\nthat he did offer to defend me with the sword, which I naturally refused, not\nbeing at all in need of bodily protection. I AM sorry when my brothers do not\nshare my decision to hear (and be) only one voice, because it weakens them as\nteachers AND learners. But yet I know that they cannot really betray themselves\nor me, and that it is still on them that I MUST build my church.\n\nThere is no choice in this, because only you can BE the foundation of\nGod's church. A church is where an altar is, and the presence of the altar is\nwhat makes it a church. Any church which does not inspire love has a hidden altar\nwhich is not serving the purpose for which God intended it. I must found His\nchurch on you because you, who accept me as a model are literally my disciples.\nDisciples are followers, but if the model they follow has chosen to SAVE THEM\nPAIN IN ALL RESPECTS, they are probably unwise NOT to follow him.\n\nI elected, both for your sake AND mine, to demonstrate that the most\noutrageous assault, as judged by the ego, did not matter. As the world judges\nthese things, but NOT as God knows them, I was betrayed, abandoned, beaten, torn,\nand finally killed. It was perfectly clear that this was only because of the\nprojection of others onto me, because I had not harmed anyone and had healed\nmany. We are still equal as learners, even though we need not have equal\nexperiences. The Holy Spirit is glad when you can learn enough from MINE to be\nre-awakened by them. That was their only purpose, and that is the only way\nin which I can be perceived as the Way, the Truth, and the Light.\n\nWhen you hear only one voice, you are never called on to sacrifice. On\nthe contrary, by enabling YOURSELVES to hear the Holy Spirit in others, you can\nlearn from their experiences and gain from them WITHOUT experiencing them. That\nis because the Holy Spirit IS one, and anyone who listens is inevitably led to\ndemonstrate His way for ALL. You are not persecuted, nor was I. You are not asked\nto repeat my experience, because the Holy Spirit which we SHARE, makes this\nunnecessary. But to use my experiences constructively for yourselves, you must\nstill follow my example in how to perceive them.\n\nMy brothers and yours are constantly engaged in justifying the\nunjustifiable. My one lesson, which I must teach as I learned, is that no\nperception which is out of accord with the judgment of the Holy Spirit CAN be\njustified. I undertook to show this was true in a very extreme case, merely\nbecause this would serve as a good teaching aid to those whose temptations to\ngive in to anger and assault would NOT be as extreme.\n\nI will, with God Himself, that none of His Sons should suffer.\nRemember that the Holy Spirit is the communication link between God the Father\nand His separated Sons. If you will listen to His voice, you will know that you\ncannot either hurt or BE hurt, but that many need your blessing to help them hear\nthis for themselves. When you perceive only this need in them, and do not respond\nto any others, you will have learned of me, and be as eager to share your\nlearning as I am. The crucifixion CANNOT be shared, because it is the symbol of\nprojection. But the Resurrection IS the symbol of sharing, because the reawakening\nof every Son of God is necessary to enable the Sonship to know its\nwholeness. Only this IS knowledge.\n\nT 6 B 14. The message of the crucifixion is very simple and perfectly clear:\n“teach ONLY love, for that is what you ARE.” If you interpret it in any other\nway, you are using it as a weapon for assault rather than as the call to peace\nfor which it was intended. The Apostles often misunderstood it, and always for\nthe same reason that makes anyone misunderstand anything. Their\nown imperfect love made them vulnerable to projection, and out of their own fear\nthey spoke of the wrath of God as His RETALIATORY weapon. They also could not\nspeak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their own sense of guilt\nhad made them angry.\n\nThere are two glaring examples of upside down thinking in the New\nTestament, whose whole Gospel is only the message of love. These are not at all\nlike the several slips into impatience which I made, because I had learned the\nAtonement prayer, which I also came to teach, too well to engage in upside down\nthinking myself. If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have\nquoted ME as saying, “I come not to bring peace but a sword.” This is clearly the\nexact opposite of everything I taught.\n\nNor could they have described my reactions to Judas Iscariot as they\ndid, if they had really understood ME. They could not have believed that I could\nhave said, “Betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?” unless I BELIEVED IN\nBETRAYAL. The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did NOT. The\n“punishment” which I am said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar\nreversal. Judas was my brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as\nmyself. Was it likely that I would condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate\nthat condemnation is impossible?\n\nI am very grateful to the Apostles for their teaching, and fully aware\nof the extent of their devotion to me. But as you read their teachings, remember\nthat I told them myself that there was much they would understand later, because\nthey were NOT wholly ready to follow me at the time. I emphasize this only\nbecause I do not want you to allow ANY fear to enter into the thought system\ntoward which I am guiding you. I do NOT call for martyrs but for TEACHERS.\n\nBill is an outstanding example of this confusion, and has literally\nbelieved for years that teaching IS martyrdom. This is because he thought, and\nstill thinks at times, that teaching leads to crucifixion rather than to reawakening.\nThe upside down nature of this association is so obvious that\nhe could only have made it BECAUSE he felt guilty. No-one is “punished” for sins,\nand the Sons of God are not sinners. ANY concept of “punishment” involves the\nprojection of blame, and REINFORCES the idea that blame is justified. The\nbehavior that results is a LESSON IN BLAME, just as all behavior teaches the\nbeliefs that motivate it.\n\nThe crucifixion was a complex of behaviors arising out of clearly\nopposed thought systems. As such, it is the perfect symbol of conflict between\nthe ego and the Son of God. It was as much intrapersonal as interpersonal then,\njust as it is now, and it is still just as real. But BECAUSE it is just as real\nnow, its lesson, too, has equal reality WHEN IT IS LEARNED. I do not need\ngratitude any more than I needed protection. But YOU need to develop your\nweakened ability to BE grateful, or you cannot appreciate God. HE does not need\nyour appreciation, but you DO.\n\nYou cannot love what you do not appreciate, and FEAR MAKES\nAPPRECIATION IMPOSSIBLE. Whenever you are afraid of what you are, you do not\nappreciate it, and will therefore reject it. As a result, you will TEACH\nREJECTION. The power of the Sons of God is operating all the time, because they\nwere created as creators. Their influence on EACH OTHER is without limit, and\nMUST be used for their joint salvation. Each one MUST learn to teach that all\nforms of rejection are utterly meaningless.\n\nThe separation IS the notion of rejection. As long as you teach this,\nYOU still believe it. This is NOT as God thinks, and you must think as He thinks\nif you are to know Him again.",

    "content": "The Uses of Projection\n\nAny split in will MUST involve a rejection of part of it, and this IS\nthe belief in separation. The wholeness of God, which IS His peace, cannot be\nappreciated EXCEPT by a whole mind, which recognizes the wholeness of God's\ncreation and BY this recognition knows its Creator.\n\nExclusion and separation are synonymous. So are separation and\ndissociation. We have said before that the separation was and IS dissociation,\nand also that once it had occurred, projection became its main defense, or the\ndevice which KEEPS IT GOING. The reason, however, may not be\nas clear to you as you think. What you project you disown, and therefore DO NOT\nBELIEVE IS YOURS. You are therefore EXCLUDING yourself from it, by the very\nstatement you are making that you are DIFFERENT from someone else. Since you have\nalso judged AGAINST what you project, you attack it because you have already\nattacked it BY rejecting it. By doing this UNCONSCIOUSLY, you try to keep the\nfact that you must have attacked yourself FIRST out of awareness, and thus\nimagine that you have made yourself safe.\n\nProjection will ALWAYS hurt you. It reinforces your belief in your own\nsplit mind, and its ONLY purpose is to KEEP THE SEPARATION GOING. It is solely a\ndevice of the ego to make you feel DIFFERENT from your brothers and separated\nFROM them. The ego justifies this on the wholly spurious grounds that it makes\nyou seem better than they are, thus obscuring equality WITH them still further.\n\nProjection and attack are inevitably related, because projection is\nALWAYS a means of JUSTIFYING attack. Anger without projection is impossible. The\nego uses projection ONLY to distort your perception of both yourself AND your\nbrothers. It begins by excluding something you think exists in you which you do\nnot want, and leads directly to your excluding yourself from your brothers.\n\nBut we know that there is another use of projection. Every ability of\nthe ego has a better counterpart, because its abilities are directed by the mind,\nwhich has a better voice. The Holy Spirit, as well as the ego, utilizes\nprojection but since their goals are opposed, so is the result. The Holy Spirit\nbegins by perceiving YOU as perfect. KNOWING this perfection is shared, it\nRECOGNIZES it in others, thus strengthening it in both. Instead of anger, this\narouses love FOR both because IT ESTABLISHES INCLUSION. Perceiving equality, it\nperceives equal needs. This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement IS\nthe one need which is universal.\n\nTo perceive YOURSELF in this way is the ONLY way in which you can find\nhappiness in this world. This is because it is the acknowledgement that you are\nNOT in this world, and the world IS unhappy. How else can you find joy in a\njoyless place EXCEPT by realizing that YOU ARE NOT THERE? You cannot be ANYWHERE\nthat God did not put you, and God created you as part of HIM. That is both WHERE\nyou are and WHAT you are. This is COMPLETELY unalterable. It is total inclusion.\nYou cannot change this now or ever. It is forever true. It is NOT a belief, but a\nfact.\n\nAnything that God creates is as true as He is. Its truth lies only in\nits perfect inclusion in Him Who alone IS perfect. To deny this in any way is to\ndeny yourself AND Him, because it is impossible to accept one without the other.\nThe perfect equality of the Holy Spirit's perception is the counterpart of the\nperfect equality of God's knowing. The ego's perception has no counterpart in\nGod, but the Holy Spirit remains the bridge between perception and knowledge. By\nenabling you to use perception in a way that PARALLELS knowledge, you will\nultimately meet it and KNOW it.\n\nThe ego prefers to believe that parallel lines do not meet, and\nconceives of their meeting as impossible. But you might remember that even the\nhuman eye perceives them as if they DO meet in the distance, which is the same as\nIN THE FUTURE, if time and space are one dimension. The later mathematics support\nthe interpretation of ultimate convergence of the parallel theoretically.\nEVERYTHING meets in God, because everything was created BY Him and IN Him. God\ncreated His Sons by extending His Thought and retaining the extensions of His\nThought in His Mind. ALL His Thoughts are thus perfectly united within themselves\nand with each other because they, were created neither partially nor in part.\n\nT  C 9.The Holy Spirit enables you to PERCEIVE THIS WHOLENESS NOW. You can no\nmore pray for yourselves alone than you can find joy for yourself\nalone. Prayer is a re-statement of INCLUSION, directed by the Holy Spirit under\nthe laws of God. God created you to create. You cannot EXTEND His Kingdom until\nyou KNOW of its wholeness. But thoughts begin in the mind OF THE THINKER, from\nwhich they extend outward. This is as true of God's thinking as it is of yours.\nBecause your minds are split, you can also perceive as well as think, but\nperception cannot escape from the basic laws of mind. You perceive FROM your\nmind, and extend your perceptions outward.\n\nAlthough perception of any kind is unnecessary, YOU made it and the\nHoly Spirit can therefore use it well. He can INSPIRE perception and lead it\ntoward God by making it PARALLEL to God's way of thinking, and thus guaranteeing\ntheir ultimate meeting. This convergence SEEMS to be far in the future ONLY\nbecause your mind is NOT in perfect alignment with the idea, and therefore DOES\nNOT WANT IT NOW. The Holy Spirit USES time, but does NOT believe in it. Coming\nfrom God, He uses EVERYTHING for good, but does not BELIEVE in what is not true.\n\nSince the Holy Spirit IS in your minds, then your minds MUST be able\nto believe ONLY what is true. The Holy Spirit can speak only for this, because he\nspeaks for God. He tells you to return your whole mind to God, BECAUSE IT HAS\nNEVER LEFT HIM. If it has never left Him, you need only perceive it AS IT IS to\nBE returned. The full awareness of the Atonement, then, is the recognition that\nthe separation NEVER OCCURRED. The ego CANNOT prevail against this, because it is\nan explicit statement that the EGO never occurred.\n\nThe ego can accept the idea that RETURN is necessary, because it can\nso easily make the idea seem so difficult. But the Holy Spirit tells you that\neven RETURN is unnecessary, because what never happened CANNOT involve ANY\nproblem. But it does NOT follow that YOU cannot make the idea of return both\nnecessary AND difficult. God made nothing either necessary OR difficult. But YOU\nhave perceived both AS IF they were part of His perfect creations. Yet it is\nsurely clear that the perfect NEED nothing, and CANNOT\nexperience perfection as a difficult accomplishment because that is what they\nARE.\n\nThis is the way in which you MUST perceive God's Creations, bringing\nall of your perceptions into the one parallel line which the Holy Spirit sees.\nThis line is the direct line of communication with God, and lets YOUR mind\nconverge with HIS. There is NO CONFLICT ANYWHERE in this perception, because it\nmeans that ALL perception is guided by the Holy Spirit, whose mind is fixed on\nGod. ONLY the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because ONLY the Holy Spirit is\nconflict-free. He perceives ONLY what is true in YOUR mind, and extends outward\nto ONLY what is true in other minds.\n\nThe difference between the ego's use of projection and projection as\nthe Holy Spirit uses it is very simple. The ego projects to EXCLUDE and therefore\nto deceive. The Holy Spirit projects by RECOGNIZING HIMSELF in EVERY mind, and\nthus perceives them as ONE. Nothing conflicts in this perception, because what\nthe Holy Spirit perceives IS the same. Wherever He looks He sees Himself, and\nbecause He is UNITED, He offers the whole Kingdom always. This is the one message\nwhich God gave TO Him, and for which He must speak because that is what He IS.\nThe peace of God lies in that message, and so the peace of God lies in YOU.\n\nThe great peace of the Kingdom shines in your mind forever, but it\nmust shine OUTWARD to make YOU aware of it. The Holy Spirit was given you with\nperfect impartiality, and only by perceiving Him impartially can you perceive Him\nat all. The ego is legion, but the Holy Spirit is one. No darkness abides\nANYWHERE in the Kingdom, so your part is only to allow no darkness to abide in",

    "content": "The Relinquishment of Attack\n\nWe have used many words as synonymous which are not ordinarily\nregarded as the same. We began with having and being, and recently have used\nothers. Hearing and being is an example, to which we can also add teaching and\nbeing, learning and being, and, above all, PROJECTING and being. This is because,\nas we have said before, every idea begins in the mind of the thinker and extends\noutward. Therefore, what extends FROM the mind IS STILL IN IT, and FROM what it\nextends IT KNOWS ITSELF. This is its natural talent.\n\nThe word “knows” is correct here, even though the ego does NOT know,\nand is not concerned with BEING at all. The Holy Spirit still holds knowledge\nsafe through its impartial perception. By attacking nothing, it presents no\nbarrier at all to the communication of God. Therefore, being is never threatened.\nYour Godlike mind can never be defiled. The ego never was and never will be part\nof it.\n\nBut through the ego you CAN hear and learn and teach and project WHAT\nIS NOT TRUE. From this, which YOU have made, you have taught yourselves to\nbelieve you ARE NOT WHAT YOU ARE. You CANNOT teach what you have not learned. And\nwhat you teach you strengthen in yourselves BECAUSE you are sharing it. Every\nlesson which you teach YOU are learning.\n\nThat is why you must teach only ONE lesson. If you are to be conflict\nfree yourselves, you must learn ONLY from the Holy Spirit, and teach ONLY by Him.\nYou ARE only love, but when you denied this you made what you ARE something you\nmust LEARN. We said before that the message of the Crucifixion was teach ONLY\nlove, for that is what you ARE. This is the ONE lesson which is perfectly\nunified, because it is the only lesson which IS one. And only BY teaching it can\nYOU learn it.\n\n“As you teach so will you learn.” If that is true, and it is true\nindeed, you must never forget that what you teach is teaching YOU. What you\nproject you BELIEVE. The only REAL safety lies in projecting ONLY the Holy\nSpirit, because as you see His gentleness in others your own mind perceives\nITSELF as totally harmless. Once it can accept this fully, it does NOT see the\nneed to PROTECT ITSELF. The protection of God then dawns upon it, assuring it\nthat it is perfectly safe forever.\n\nThe perfectly safe ARE wholly benign. They bless because they know\nthey ARE blessed. Without anxiety, the mind is wholly kind, and because it\nPROJECTS beneficence, it IS beneficent. Safety is the COMPLETE RELINQUISHMENT OF\nATTACK. No compromise is possible in this. Teach attack in any form, and YOU HAVE\nLEARNED IT AND IT WILL HURT YOU. But your learning is not immortal, and you can\nunlearn it BY NOT TEACHING IT. Since you cannot NOT teach, your salvation lies in\nteaching exactly the opposite of EVERYTHING THE EGO BELIEVES. This is how YOU\nwill learn the truth that will make you free, and keep you so as others learn it\nof YOU.\n\nThe only way to HAVE peace is to TEACH peace. By learning it through\nprojection, it becomes a part of you that you KNOW, because you cannot teach what\nyou have dissociated. Only thus can you win back the knowledge you threw away. An\nidea which you SHARE you MUST HAVE. It awakens in you through the CONVICTION of",

    "content": "The Only Answer\n\nRemember that the Holy Spirit is the ANSWER, not the question. The ego\nalways speaks first, because it is capricious and does NOT mean its maker well.\nThis is because it believes, and correctly, that its maker may withdraw his\nsupport from it at any moment. If it meant you well, it would be glad, as the\nHoly Spirit will be glad when He has brought you home and you no longer need His\nguidance. The ego does NOT regard itself as part of you. Herein lies its primary\nperceptual error, the foundation of its whole thought system.\n\nWhen God created you, He made you part of Him. That is why attack\nWITHIN the Kingdom is impossible. But YOU made the ego without love, and so it\ndoes not love YOU. You could not remain WITHIN the Kingdom without love, and\nsince the Kingdom IS love, you believe you are WITHOUT it. This enables the ego\nto regard itself as SEPARATE AND OUTSIDE ITS MAKER, thus speaking for the part of\nyour mind that believes YOU are separate and outside the Mind of God.\n\nThe ego, then, raised the first question that was ever asked, but it\ncan never answer it. That question, which was “What are you?” was the beginning\nof doubt. The ego has never answered ANY questions since, though it has raised a\ngreat many. The most inventive activities of the ego have never done more than\nOBSCURE THE QUESTION, because you HAVE the answer, and THE EGO IS AFRAID OF YOU.\nYou cannot really understand conflict until YOU fully understand one basic fact\nthat the ego does not know. The Holy Spirit does not speak first, but He ALWAYS\nanswers. EVERYONE has called upon Him for help at one time or another, and in one\nway or another, AND HAS BEEN ANSWERED. Since the Holy Spirit answers truly, He\nanswers FOR ALL TIME, and that means that EVERYONE HAS THE ANSWER NOW.\n\nThe ego cannot hear the Holy Spirit, but it DOES feel that part of the\nsame mind that made it is AGAINST it. It interprets this wholly as a\njustification for ATTACKING its maker. The ego believes that the best defense is\nattack, and WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE THIS. Unless you DO believe it, you will not\nside with it. And the ego feels badly in need of allies, though not of brothers.\n\nPerceiving something alien to itself in your MIND, the ego turns to\nthe body, NOT the mind as its ally BECAUSE the body is not part of you. This\nmakes the body the ego's friend. But it is an alliance frankly based on\nseparation. If you side with this alliance, you WILL be afraid, because you are\nsiding with an alliance OF fear. The ego and the body conspire AGAINST your\nminds, and because they realize that their “enemy” CAN end them both merely by\nknowing they are not part of him, they join in the attack together. This is\nperhaps the strangest perception of all, if you consider what it really involves.\nThe ego, which is not real, attempts to persuade the mind, which IS real, that it\nIS its own learning device, and that the learning device is more real than IT is.\nNo-one in his right mind could POSSIBLY believe this, and no-one in his right\nmind DOES believe it.\n\nHear, then, the one answer of the Holy Spirit to ALL the questions\nwhich the ego raises. You are a Child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom,\nwhich He created as part of Him. Nothing else exists, and ONLY this is real. You\nhave chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real,\nand God calls you to awake. There will be nothing left of your dream when you\nhear Him, because you WILL be awake. Your dreams have contained many of the ego's\nsymbols, and they have confused you. But that was only because you were asleep\nand DID NOT KNOW.\n\nWhen you awake, you will see the Truth around you and in you, and you\nwill no longer believe in dreams, because they will have no reality for you. But\nthe Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you,\nbecause they are beautiful and true. In the Kingdom, where you are and what you\nare is perfectly certain. There is no doubt there, because the first question was\nnever asked. Having finally been wholly answered, IT HAS NEVER BEEN. BEING alone\nlives in the Kingdom, where everything lives in God without question. The time\nthat was spent on questioning in the dream has given way to the Creation and to\nits Eternity.\n\nYOU are as certain as God, because you are as true as He is. But what\nwas once quite certain in your minds has become only the ABILITY for certainty.\nThe introduction of abilities into being was the beginning of UNcertainty,\nbecause abilities are POTENTIALS, not accomplishments. Your abilities are totally\nuseless in the presence of God's accomplishments and also of yours.\nAccomplishments are RESULTS which HAVE BEEN achieved. When they are perfect,\nabilities are meaningless.\n\nIt is curious that the perfect must now be perfected. In fact, it is\nimpossible. But you must remember that when you put yourselves in an impossible\nsituation, you believed that the impossible WAS possible.\n\nAbilities must be DEVELOPED, or you cannot use them. This is not true\nof anything that God created, but it is the kindest solution possible to what YOU\nhave made. In an impossible situation, you can develop your abilities to the\npoint where they CAN GET YOU OUT OF IT. You have a guide to how to develop them,\nbut you have no commander EXCEPT YOURSELF. This leaves YOU in charge of the\nKingdom, with both a guide to FIND it and a MEANS to keep it. You have a model to\nfollow who will strengthen YOUR command, and never detract from it in any way.\nYou therefore retain the central place in your perceived enslavement, a fact\nwhich ITSELF demonstrates that you are NOT enslaved.\n\nYou are in an impossible situation only because you thought it was\npossible to be in one. You WOULD be in an impossible situation if God showed you\nyour perfection, and PROVED to you that you were wrong. This would demonstrate\nthat the perfect were inadequate to bring THEMSELVES to the awareness of their\nperfection, and thus side with the belief that those who have everything need\nhelp, and are therefore helpless.\n\nThis is the kind of reasoning that the ego engages in, but God, who\nKNOWS that His creations are perfect does NOT insult them. This would be as\nimpossible as the ego's notion that it has insulted Him. That is why the Holy\nSpirit NEVER commands. To command is to assume INequality, which the Holy Spirit\ndemonstrates does not exist. Fidelity to premises is a law of the mind, and\neverything God created is faithful to His laws. But fidelity to other laws is\nalso possible, not because the laws are true, but because YOU MADE THEM.\n\nWhat would be gained if God proved to you that you have thought\ninsanely? Can God lose His own certainty? We have frequently stated that what you\nteach you ARE. Would you have God teach you that you have sinned? If He\nconfronted the self you have made with the Truth He created FOR you, what could\nyou be but afraid? You would doubt your sanity, which is the one thing in which\nyou can FIND the sanity He gave you. God does not teach. To teach is to imply a\nlack which God KNOWS is not there. God is not conflicted. Teaching aims at\nchange, but God created ONLY the changeless.\n\nThe separation was not a loss of perfection, but a failure in\nCOMMUNICATION. A harsh and strident form of communication arose as the ego's\nvoice. It could not shatter the peace of God, but it COULD shatter YOURS. God did\nnot blot it out, because to eradicate it would be to attack it. Being questioned,",

    "content": "“To Have, Give All to All”\n\nLike any good teacher, He DOES know more than you know NOW, but He\nteaches only to make you equals. This is because you had ALREADY taught wrong,\nhaving believed what was not true. YOU DID NOT BELIEVE IN YOUR OWN PERFECTION.\nCould God teach you that you had made a split mind when He knows your mind only\nas whole?\n\nWhat God DOES know is that His communication channels are not open to\nHim, so that He cannot impart His joy and know that His Children are wholly\njoyous. This is an ongoing process, not in time, but in eternity. God's extending\noutward, though not His completeness, was blocked when the Sonship does not\ncommunicate with Him as one. So He thought, “My Children sleep, and must be\nawakened.”\n\nHow can you wake children better and more kindly than with a gentle\nVoice that will not frighten them, but will merely remind them that the night is\nover and the Light has come? You do not inform them that the nightmares which\nfrightened them so badly were not real, because children BELIEVE in magic. You\nmerely reassure them that they are safe NOW. Then you train them to RECOGNIZE THE\nDIFFERENCE between sleeping and waking, so that THEY will understand they need\nnot be afraid of dreams. Then when bad dreams come, they will call on the Light\nTHEMSELVES to dispel them.\n\nA wise teacher teaches through approach, NOT avoidance. He does not\nemphasize what you must avoid to escape from harm as much as what you need to\nlearn to have joy. This is true even of the world's teachers. Consider the\nconfusion that a child would experience if he were told, “Do not do THIS because\nit might hurt you and make you unsafe, but if you do THAT you will escape from\nharm and be safe, and then you will not be afraid.” All of this could be included\nin only three words: “Do only that.” That simple statement is perfectly clear,\neasily understood, and very easily remembered.\n\nThe Holy Spirit NEVER itemizes errors, because He does not frighten\nchildren, and those who lack wisdom ARE children. But He ALWAYS answers their\ncall, and His dependability makes THEM more certain. Children DO confuse fantasy\nand reality, and they ARE frightened because they do not know the difference.\n\nThe Holy Spirit makes NO distinction among dreams. He merely shines\nthem away. His light is ALWAYS the call to awake, WHATEVER you may have been\ndreaming. Nothing lasting lies in dreams, and the Holy Spirit, shining with the\nlight from God Himself, speaks only for what lasts forever.\n\nWhen your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know\nthat YOU will last forever. Many think that this is accomplished through death,\nbut NOTHING is accomplished through death because death is nothing. EVERYTHING is\naccomplished through life, and life is of the mind and in the Mind. The body\nneither lives nor dies, because it cannot contain you who ARE life. If we share\nthe same mind, YOU CAN OVERCOME DEATH BECAUSE I DID. Death is an attempt to\nresolve conflict by not willing at all. Like any other impossible solution which\nthe ego attempts, IT WILL NOT WORK.\n\nGod did not make the body, because it is destructible, and therefore\nnot of the Kingdom. The body is the symbol of the WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE. It is\nclearly a separation device, and therefore does not exist. The Holy Spirit, as\nalways, takes what you have made and translates it into a learning device FOR\nyou. Again, as always, it re-interprets what the ego uses as an argument FOR\nseparation into an argument AGAINST it.\n\nIf the mind can heal the body, but the body cannot heal the mind, then\nthe mind MUST BE STRONGER. Every miracle demonstrates this. We have said that the\nHoly Spirit is the MOTIVATION for miracles. This is because He ALWAYS tells you\nthat ONLY the mind is real, because only the mind CAN BE SHARED. The body IS\nseparate, and therefore CANNOT be part of you. To be of one mind is meaningful,\nbut to be of one body is meaningless. By the laws of mind, then, the body IS\nmeaningless.\n\nTo the Holy Spirit THERE IS NO ORDER OF DIFFICULTY IN MIRACLES. This\nis FAMILIAR enough to you by now, but it has not yet become believable.\nTherefore, you do not understand it and cannot USE it. We have too much to\naccomplish on behalf of the Kingdom to let this crucial concept slip away. It is\na real foundation stone of the thought system I teach and want YOU to teach. You\ncannot perform miracles without believing it, because it is a belief in perfect\nequality.\n\nOnly one equal gift CAN be offered to the equal Sons of God, and that\nis FULL APPRECIATION. Nothing more and nothing less. Without a range, order of\ndifficulty IS meaningless, and there must BE no range in what you offer to each\nother. The Holy Spirit, which leads to God, translates communication into being,\njust as He ultimately translates perception into knowledge.\n\nYou DO NOT LOSE WHAT YOU COMMUNICATE. The ego uses the body for\nattack, for pleasure, and for pride. The insanity of this perception makes it a\nfearful one. The Holy Spirit sees it only as a means of COMMUNICATION. And\nbecause communicating IS sharing, it becomes communion. You might argue that fear\nas well as love can be communicated, and therefore can be shared. But this is not\nso real as it sounds. Those who communicate fear are promoting attack, and attack\nalways BREAKS communication, and therefore makes communion impossible.\n\nEgos DO join together in temporary allegiance, but always for WHAT\nEACH ONE CAN GET SEPARATELY. The Holy Spirit communicates only WHAT EACH ONE CAN\nGIVE TO ALL. He never takes ANYTHING back, because He wants YOU to keep it.\nTherefore, His teaching begins with the lesson: To HAVE, GIVE all TO all.\n\nThis is a very preliminary step, and THE ONLY ONE YOU MUST TAKE\nYOURSELF. It is not even necessary that you COMPLETE the step yourself, but it IS\nnecessary that you turn in that direction. Having willed to go that way, you\nplace YOURSELF in charge of the journey, where you and ONLY you must remain.\n\nThis step APPEARS to exacerbate conflict rather than resolve it,\nbecause it is the BEGINNING step in reversing your perception and turning it\nright side up. This conflicts with the upside down perception which you have not\nyet abandoned, or the change in direction would not have been necessary. Some\npeople remain at this step for a very long time, experiencing VERY acute\nconflict. Many try to accept the CONFLICT, rather than to take the next step\ntoward its resolution. But having taken the first step, they WILL be helped.\nHaving willed what they CANNOT complete alone, THEY ARE NO LONGER ALONE.\n\nYou, Helen, had taken this step, and because you believed in it, you\ntaught it to Bill, who still believed in the solution of sleep. You were not\nconsistent in teaching it, but you did so often enough to enable him to learn it.\nOnce HE learned it, he could teach YOU how to become more consistently awake, and\nthus begin to waken HIMSELF. This placed him, too, in command of the journey. His\nrecognition of the direction it must take was perfectly stated when he INSISTED\nON COLLABORATION.",

    "content": "“To Have Peace, Teach Peace to Learn It”\n\nAll the separated ones have a basic fear of retaliation and\nabandonment. This is because they BELIEVE in attack and rejection, so this is\nwhat they perceive and teach and LEARN. These insane concepts are clearly the\nresult of their own dissociation and projection. What you teach you are, but it\nis quite apparent that you can teach wrongly, and therefore TEACH YOURSELVES\nWRONG. Many thought that I was attacking them, even though it is quite apparent\nthat I was NOT. An insane learner learns strange lessons.\n\nWhat you must understand is that, when you do not SHARE a thought\nsystem, you ARE weakening it. Those who BELIEVE in it therefore perceive this as\nan ATTACK ON THEM. This is because everyone identifies himself WITH his thought\nsystem, and EVERY thought system centers on WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE. If the\ncenter of the thought system is TRUE, only truth extends outward from it. But if\na lie is at its center, only DECEPTION proceeds from it.\n\nAll good teachers realize that only fundamental change will last. But\nthey do NOT begin at that level. Strengthening MOTIVATION for change is their\nfirst and foremost goal. It is also their last and final one. Increasing\nmotivation for change IN THE LEARNER is all that a teacher NEED do to GUARANTEE\nchange. This is because a change in motivation IS a change of mind, and this will\nINEVITABLY produce fundamental change BECAUSE the mind IS fundamental.\n\nThe first step in the reversal or undoing process, then, is the\nUNDOING of the getting concept. Accordingly, the Holy Spirit's first lesson was:\nTo HAVE, GIVE all TO all. We said that this is apt to INCREASE conflict\ntemporarily, and we can clarify this still further now. At this point, the\nequality of having and being is not yet perceived. Until it IS, having still\nappears to be the OPPOSITE of being. Therefore, the first lesson SEEMS to contain\na contradiction because it is BEING LEARNED BY A CONFLICTED MIND. This MEANS\nconflicting motivation, and so the lesson CANNOT be learned consistently as yet.\n\nFurther, the mind of the learner projects its own split, and therefore\ndoes NOT perceive consistent minds in others, making him suspicious of THEIR\nmotivations. This is the real reason why in many respects the first lesson is the\nhardest to learn. Still strongly aware of the ego in himself, and responding\nprimarily TO the ego in others, he is being taught to react to BOTH as if what he\nDOES believe IS NOT TRUE.\n\nUpside down as always, the ego perceives the first lesson as insane.\nIn fact, this is its only alternative here, because the other one, which would be\nmuch LESS acceptable, would obviously be that IT is insane. The ego's judgment,\nthen, is predetermined by what it IS, though not more so than is any other\nproduct of thought. The fundamental change will still occur with the change of\nmind IN THE THINKER.\n\nMeanwhile, the increasing clarity of the Holy Spirit's voice makes it\nimpossible for the learner NOT TO LISTEN. For a time, then, he IS receiving\nconflicting messages AND ACCEPTING BOTH. This is the classic “double bind” in\ncommunication, which you wrote about yourselves quite recently, and with good\nexamples too. It is interesting that Helen claimed at the time that she had never\nheard of it and did not understand it. You might remember our brother's\ninsistence on its inclusion. Helen thought he had become (quite) irrational on\nthis point, but it was quite strongly reinforced in HIS mind, and so he wanted to\nteach it in his text. This, of course, was a very good way for YOU to learn it.\n\nThe way out of conflict between two opposing thought systems is\nclearly TO CHOOSE ONE AND RELINQUISH THE OTHER. If you identify WITH your thought\nsystem, and you cannot escape this, and if you accept two thought systems which\nare in COMPLETE DISagreement, peace of mind IS impossible. If you TEACH both,\nwhich you will surely do as long as you ACCEPT both, you are teaching conflict\nand LEARNING it. But you DO want peace, or you would not have called upon the\nvoice for PEACE to help you. His LESSON is not insane, but the CONFLICT IS.\n\nThere can BE no conflict between sanity and insanity, because only one\nis true, and therefore only ONE is REAL. The ego tries to persuade you that it is\nup to YOU to decide which voice is true. But the Holy Spirit teaches you that\ntruth was created by God, and YOUR decision CANNOT change it. As you begin to\nrealize the quiet power of His Voice AND ITS PERFECT CONSISTENCY, it MUST dawn on\nyour minds that you are\ntrying to undo a decision which was made irrevocably FOR you. That is why we\nsuggested before that there was help in reminding yourselves to allow the Holy\nSpirit to decide for God for YOU.\n\nYou are NOT asked to make insane decisions, although you are free to\nTHINK you are. But it MUST be insane to believe IT IS UP TO YOU to decide what\nGod's Creations ARE. The Holy Spirit perceives the conflict EXACTLY AS IT IS.\nTherefore, His second lesson is: To HAVE peace, TEACH peace to LEARN it.\n\nThis is still a preliminary step, because having and being are still\nnot equated but it is more advanced than the first step, which is really only a\nthought REVERSAL. The second step is a positive affirmation of WHAT YOU WANT.\nThis, then IS a step in the direction OUT of conflict, because it means that\nalternatives have been considered, and ONE has been chosen as MORE DESIRABLE.\n\nBut the evaluation “more desirable” still implies that the desirable\nhas degrees. Therefore, although this step is essential for the ultimate\ndecision, it is clearly NOT the final one.\n\nIt should be clear that the recognition of the lack of order in\nmiracles has not yet been accepted, because NOTHING is difficult that is WHOLLY\nDESIRED. To desire wholly is to CREATE, and creating CANNOT be difficult if God\nHimself created you AS a creator. The second step, then, is still perceptual but\nit is nevertheless a giant step toward the unified perception that parallels\nGod's knowing.\n\nAs you take this step and HOLD THIS DIRECTION, you will be pushing\ntoward the center of your thought system, where the FUNDAMENTAL change will\noccur. You are only beginning this step now, but you have started on this way by\nrealizing that ONLY ONE WAY IS POSSIBLE. You do not yet realize this",

    "content": "“Be Vigilant Only for God and His Kingdom”\n\nFor your own salvation you MUST be critical, because YOUR salvation IS\ncritical to the whole Sonship. We said before that the Holy Spirit IS evaluative,\nand MUST be. Yet His evaluation does not extend BEYOND you, or you WOULD share\nit. In YOUR mind, and your mind ONLY, He sorts out the true from the false, and\nteaches you to judge every thought that you allow to ENTER in the light of what\nGod PUT there. Whatever is IN ACCORD with this light He retains, to strengthen\nthe Kingdom in YOU. When it is PARTLY in accord with truth He accepts it and\npurifies it. But what is OUT OF ACCORD ENTIRELY He rejects by judging against.\nThis is how He keeps the Kingdom perfectly consistent and perfectly unified.\n\nBut what you must remember is that what the Holy Spirit REJECTS the\nego ACCEPTS. This is because they are in fundamental disagreement about\neverything, because they are in fundamental disagreement about WHAT YOU ARE. The\nego's beliefs on this crucial issue vary, and that is why it promotes different\nmoods. The Holy Spirit NEVER varies on this point, and so the ONE mood that He\nengenders is joy. He PROTECTS this by rejecting everything that does NOT foster\njoy, and so He alone can keep you wholly joyous.\n\nThe Holy Spirit does not teach your mind to be critical of other\nminds, because He does not want you to teach your errors and LEARN THEM\nYOURSELVES. He would hardly be consistent if He allowed you to STRENGTHEN what\nyou must learn to avoid. In the mind of the THINKER, then, He IS judgmental, but\nonly in order to unify it so IT CAN perceive WITHOUT judgment.\nThis enables the mind to TEACH without judgment and therefore learn to BE without\njudgment. The UNdoing is necessary only in YOUR mind, so that you cannot PROJECT\nit. God Himself has established what you can project with perfect safety.\nTherefore, the Holy Spirit's third lesson is: Be vigilant ONLY for God and HIS\nKingdom.\n\nThis is a major step toward FUNDAMENTAL change. Yet it is still a\nlesson in thought REVERSAL, because it implies that there is something you must\nbe vigilant AGAINST. It has advanced far from the first lesson which was\nPRIMARILY a reversal, and also from the second, which was essentially the\nidentification of what is MORE desirable. This step, which follows from the\nsecond as the second does from the first, emphasizes the DICHOTOMY between the\ndesirable and the UNdesirable. It therefore makes the ULTIMATE choice inevitable.\nBut while the first step seems to INCREASE conflict, and the second still ENTAILS\nit to some extent, this one calls for CONSISTENT EFFORT AGAINST IT.\n\nWe said already that you can be as vigilant AGAINST the ego as FOR it.\nThis lesson teaches not that you CAN be, but that you MUST be. It does not\nconcern itself with order of difficulty, but with CLEAR-CUT PRIORITY FOR\nVIGILANCE. This step is unequivocal in that it teaches THERE MUST BE NO\nEXCEPTIONS, but it does NOT deny that the temptations to MAKE exceptions will\noccur. Here, then, your consistency is called on DESPITE chaos. But chaos and\nconsistency CANNOT coexist for long, because they are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.\nAs long as you must be vigilant against ANYTHING, however, you are not\nrecognizing this, and are holding the belief that you can CHOOSE EITHER ONE.\n\nBy teaching you WHAT to choose, the Holy Spirit will ultimately be\nable to teach you that YOU NEED NOT CHOOSE AT ALL. This will finally liberate\nyour will FROM choice, and direct it towards creation WITHIN the Kingdom.\nChoosing through the Holy Spirit will only lead you TO it. You create by what you\nARE, but this IS what you must learn. The way to learn it is INHERENT in the\nthird step, which brings together the lessons inherent in the others, and goes\nbeyond them towards real integration.\n\nIf you allow yourselves to HAVE in your minds only what God put there,\nyou are acknowledging your mind as God created it. Therefore, you are accepting\nit AS IT IS. And since it IS whole, you are teaching peace BECAUSE you have\nbelieved in it. The final step will still be taken FOR you by God. But by the\nthird step, the Holy Spirit has PREPARED you FOR God. He is GETTING YOU READY to\ntranslate having into being by the very nature of the steps you must take WITH\nHim. You learn first that having rests on GIVING and NOT getting. Next you learn\nthat you learn what you TEACH, and that you WANT TO LEARN PEACE. This is the\nCONDITION for identifying WITH the Kingdom, because it is the condition OF the\nKingdom.\n\nBut you have believed that you are WITHOUT the Kingdom, and have\ntherefore excluded yourself FROM it in your belief. It is therefore essential to\nteach you that YOU must be INCLUDED, and the BELIEF THAT YOU ARE NOT is the ONLY\nthing that you must exclude.\n\nThe third step is thus one of PROTECTION for your minds by allowing\nyou to identify ONLY with the center, where God placed the altar to HIMSELF. We\nhave already said that altars are BELIEFS, but God and His creations are BEYOND\nbelief because they are beyond question. The Voice FOR God speaks only for BELIEF\nbeyond question, but this IS the preparation for BEING without question.\n\nAs long as belief in God and His Kingdom is assailed by ANY doubts in\nyour minds, His perfect Accomplishment is NOT apparent to you. This is why you\nMUST be vigilant ON GOD'S BEHALF. The ego speaks AGAINST His Creation, and\ntherefore DOES engender doubt. You cannot go BEYOND belief UNTIL you believe\nwholly. No one can EXTEND a lesson he has NOT LEARNED FULLY. Transfer, which IS\nextension, is the measure of learning because it is the MEASURABLE RESULT. This,\nhowever, does NOT mean that what it transfers TO is measurable. On the contrary,\nunless it transfers to the whole Sonship, which is immeasurable because it was\ncreated BY the Immeasurable, the learning itself MUST be incomplete.\n\nTo teach the WHOLE Sonship WITHOUT EXCEPTION demonstrates that you\nPERCEIVE ITS WHOLENESS and have learned that it IS One. Now you must be vigilant\nto HOLD its Oneness in your minds because if you allow doubt to enter, YOU will\nlose awareness of its wholeness, and WILL BE UNABLE TO TEACH IT.\nThe wholeness of the Kingdom does NOT depend on your perception, but your\nAWARENESS of its wholeness DOES. It is only your awareness that NEEDS protection,\nbecause your BEING cannot be assailed. Yet a real sense of being CANNOT be yours\nwhile you are doubtful of what you ARE. THIS IS WHY VIGILANCE IS ESSENTIAL.\nDoubts ABOUT being MUST not enter your mind, or you CANNOT know what you are with\ncertainty.\n\nCertainty is OF God for YOU. Vigilance is not necessary for truth, but\nit IS necessary AGAINST ILLUSION. Truth is WITHOUT illusions, and therefore\nWITHIN the Kingdom. Everything OUTSIDE the Kingdom IS ILLUSION. But you must\nlearn to ACCEPT truth because YOU THREW IT AWAY. You therefore saw yourself AS IF\nyou were WITHOUT it. By making another Kingdom WHICH YOU VALUED, you did NOT keep\nthe Kingdom of God alone in your minds, and thus placed part of your mind OUTSIDE\nof it. What you have made has thus DIVIDED YOUR WILL and given you a sick mind\nthat MUST be healed. Your vigilance AGAINST this sickness IS the way to heal it.\n\nOnce YOUR mind is healed, it radiates health and thereby TEACHES\nhealing. This establishes you as a teacher who teaches LIKE me. Vigilance was\nrequired of me as much as of you. But remember that those who will to teach the\nsame thing MUST be in agreement about what they believe.\n\nThe third step, then, is a statement of what you WANT to believe, and\nentails a willingness to RELINQUISH EVERYTHING ELSE. I told you that you were\njust beginning the second step, but I also told you that the third one FOLLOWS\nit. The Holy Spirit WILL enable you to go on IF YOU FOLLOW HIM. Your vigilance is\nthe sign that you WANT Him to guide you.\nVigilance DOES require effort, but only to teach you that effort ITSELF is\nunnecessary. You have exerted GREAT effort to preserve what you made BECAUSE it\nis NOT true. Therefore, you must now turn your effort AGAINST it. Only this can\ncancel out the NEED for effort, and call upon the BEING which you both HAVE and",

This is an ongoing process in which you SHARE, and BECAUSE you share\nit, you are inspired to create LIKE God. But in Creation you are NOT in a\nreciprocal relation TO God, because He created YOU, but you did NOT create Him.\nWe have already stated that only in this respect your creative power differs from\nHis. Even in this world there is a parallel. Parents give birth to children, but\nchildren do NOT give birth to parents. They DO, however, give birth to their\nchildren, and thus give birth AS their parents do.\n\nIf you created GOD and He created you, the KINGDOM could not increase\nthrough its OWN creative thought. Creation would therefore be limited, and you\nwould NOT be co-creators WITH God. As God's creative Thought proceeds FROM Him TO\nyou, so must YOUR creative thoughts proceed FROM you to YOUR creations.

    "content": "Bargaining versus Healing\n\nThe ego demands RECIPROCAL rights, because it is competitive rather\nthan loving. It is always willing to make a deal, but it cannot understand that\nto be LIKE another means that NO DEALS ARE POSSIBLE. To gain you must GIVE, not\nbargain. To bargain is to LIMIT giving, and this is NOT God's Will. To will WITH\nGod is to create like HIM. God does not limit HIS gifts in ANY way. You ARE His\ngifts, and so your gifts must be like HIS.\n\nYour gifts TO the Kingdom are like His to YOU. I gave ONLY love to the\nKingdom, because I believed that was what I WAS. What you believe you are\nDETERMINES your gifts, and if God created you by extending HIMSELF AS you, you\ncan only extend YOURSELF as He did. Only joy increases forever. Joy and Eternity\nare INSEPARABLE. God extends outward beyond limits and beyond time, and you, who\nare co-creators with Him, extend His Kingdom forever and beyond limit.\nEternity is the indelible stamp of Creation. The eternal are in peace and joy\nforever.\n\nTo think like God is to share His certainty of WHAT YOU ARE. And to\nCREATE like Him is to share the perfect love He shares with YOU. To this the Holy\nSpirit leads you, that your joy may be complete because the Kingdom of God is\nwhole. We have said that the last step in the re-awakening of knowledge is taken\nby God. This is true, but it is hard to explain in words, because words are\nsymbols, and nothing that is true NEEDS to be explained. However, the Holy Spirit\nalways has the task of translating the useLESS into the useFUL, the meaningLESS\ninto the meaningFUL, and the temporary into the timeLESS. He CAN, therefore, tell\nyou something about this last step, but this one you must know yourself, because\nBY it you know what you are. This IS your being.\n\nGod does not take steps because His Accomplishments are NOT gradual.\nHe does not teach, because His Creations are changeless. He does nothing LAST\nbecause He Created FIRST and FOR ALWAYS. It must be understood that the word\n“first” as applied to Him is NOT a time concept. He is first here only in the\nsense that He is first in the Holy Trinity Itself. He is the Prime Creator\nbecause HE created His co-creators. Because He DID, time applies neither to Him\nNOR to what He created.\n\nThe “last step” that God was said to take was therefore true in the\nbeginning, is true now, and will be true forever. What is timeless IS ALWAYS\nTHERE because its BEING is eternally changeless. It does NOT change by increase,\nbecause it was forever created TO increase. If you perceive it as NOT increasing,\nyou do not know what it IS. You also do not know what created it, or who HE is.\nGod does not REVEAL this to you, because it was never hidden. His light was never\nobscured, because it is His Will to SHARE it. How can what is fully shared be\nwithheld and then revealed?\n\nTo heal is the ONLY kind of thinking in this world that resembles the\nThought of God, and because of the elements which they SHARE, can transfer TO it.\nWhen a brother perceives himself as sick, he IS perceiving himself as NOT WHOLE,\nand therefore IN NEED.

    "content": "The Laws of Mind\n\nTo heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother AND yourself\nby SHARING THE HOLY SPIRIT WITH HIM. This places you both WITHIN the Kingdom and\nrestores ITS wholeness in your minds. This PARALLELS creation because it UNIFIES\nBY INCREASING, and INTEGRATES BY EXTENDING.\n\nWHAT YOU PROJECT YOU BELIEVE. This is an immutable law of mind in this\nworld as well as in the Kingdom. However, its CONTENT is somewhat different in\nthis world from what it REALLY is, because the thoughts it governs are VERY\ndifferent from the thoughts in the Kingdom. Laws must be adapted to\ncircumstances, if they are to maintain order.\n\nThe outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind, as they operate in\nthis world, is that by obeying them, and I assure you that you MUST obey them,\nyou can arrive at diametrically opposed results. This is because the laws have\nadapted to the circumstances of this world, in which diametrically opposed\noutcomes are BELIEVED in. The laws of mind govern thoughts, and you DO respond to\ntwo conflicting voices. You have heard many arguments on behalf of “the\nfreedoms,” which would indeed have BEEN freedom if man had not chosen to FIGHT\nfor them. That is why they perceive “the freedoms” as many instead of ONE.\n\nBut the argument that underlies the DEFENSE of freedom is perfectly\nvalid. Because it is true, it should not be FOUGHT for, but it SHOULD be sided\nWITH. Those who are AGAINST freedom believe that its outcome will hurt them,\nwhich CANNOT be true. But those who are FOR freedom, even if they are misguided\nin HOW they defend it, are siding with the one thing in this world which IS true.\nWhenever anyone can listen fairly to both sides of ANY issue, he WILL make the\nright decision. This is because he HAS the answer. Conflict can indeed be\nprojected, but it MUST be intrapersonal first.\n\nThe term “intraPERSONAL” is an ego term, because “personal” implies of\nONE person, and NOT of others. “Interpersonal” has a similar error, because it\nimplies something that exists between DIFFERENT individuals. When we spoke before\nof the extremely PERSONAL nature of revelation, we followed this statement\nimmediately with a description of the inevitable outcomes of the revelation in\nterms of SHARING. A PERSON conceives of himself as separate, largely because he\nperceives OF himself as bounded by a body. ONLY if he perceives as a MIND can he\novercome this. THEN he is free to use terms like “intraMENTAL” and “interMENTAL”\nWITHOUT seeing them as different and conflicting, because minds CAN be in perfect\naccord.\n\nOUTSIDE the Kingdom, the law which prevails INSIDE it is ADAPTED to\n“what you project you believe.” This is its TEACHING form, because outside the\nKingdom teaching is mandatory because learning is essential. This form of the law\nclearly implies that you will learn what YOU are from what you have projected\nonto others and therefore believe THEY are. IN the Kingdom, there is no teaching\nOR learning, because there is no BELIEF. There is only CERTAINTY. God and His\nSons, in the surety of Being, KNOW that what you project you ARE.\n\nThat form of the law is NOT adapted at all, being the Law of Creation.\nGod Himself created the law by creating BY it. And His Sons, who create LIKE Him,\nfollow it gladly, knowing that the INCREASE of the Kingdom depends on it, just as\nTHEIR creation did. Laws must be communicated, if they are to be helpful. In\neffect, they must be TRANSLATED for those who speak a different language. But a\ngood translator, though he MUST alter the FORM of what he translates, NEVER\nchanges the meaning. In fact, his whole PURPOSE is to change the form SO THAT the\noriginal meaning IS retained.\n\nThe Holy Spirit IS the translator of the Laws of God to those who do\nNOT understand them. YOU could not do this yourselves because conflicted minds\nCANNOT be faithful to one meaning, and will therefore CHANGE THE MEANING TO\nPRESERVE THE FORM. The Holy Spirit's purpose in translating is naturally EXACTLY\nthe opposite. He translates ONLY to preserve the original meaning in ALL respects\nand in ALL languages. Therefore, He OPPOSES differences in form as meaningful,\nand emphasizes always that THESE DIFFERENCES DO NOT MATTER. The meaning of His\nmessage is ALWAYS the same, and ONLY the meaning matters.\n\nGod's Law of Creation, in perfect form, does NOT involve the USE of\ntruth to convince His sons OF truth. The EXTENSION of truth, which IS the Law of\nthe Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of WHAT TRUTH IS. This is your\nINHERITANCE, and requires no learning at all. But when you DISinherited\nYOURSELVES, you BECAME learners. No-one questions the intimate connection of\nlearning and memory. Learning is impossible WITHOUT memory, because it CANNOT be\nconsistent UNLESS it is remembered.\n\nThat is why the Holy Spirit IS a lesson in remembering. We said before\nthat He teaches remembering and FORGETTING, but the forgetting aspect is only TO\nMAKE THE REMEMBERING CONSISTENT. You forget to REMEMBER BETTER. You will NOT\nunderstand His translations while you listen to two ways of perceiving them.\nTherefore, you must forget or relinquish one to UNDERSTAND the other. This is the\nonly way you can LEARN consistency, so that you can finally BE consistent. What\ncan the perfect consistency of the Kingdom MEAN to the confused? It MUST be\napparent that confusion INTERFERES with meaning, and therefore PREVENTS THE\nLEARNER FROM APPRECIATING IT.\n\nThere is NO confusion in the Kingdom, because there IS only one\nmeaning. This Meaning comes from God and IS God. Because it is also YOU, you\nshare it and EXTEND it AS YOUR CREATOR DID. This needs no translation, because it\nis perfectly understood, but it DOES need extension because it MEANS extension.\nCommunication here is perfectly direct and perfectly united. It is totally",

    "content": "The Unified Curriculum\n\nTo heal is to liberate totally. We once said there is no order in\nmiracles because they are all MAXIMAL EXPRESSIONS OF LOVE. This has no range at\nall. The non-maximal only APPEARS to have a range. This is because it SEEMS to be\nmeaningful to measure it FROM the maximum and identify its position by HOW MUCH\nIT IS NOT THERE. Actually, this does not mean ANYTHING. It is like negative\nnumbers in that the concept can be used theoretically, but it has NO application\npractically. It is true that if you put three apples on the table and then took\nthem AWAY, the three apples are NOT THERE. But it is NOT true that the table is\nnow MINUS three apples. If there is NOTHING on the table, it does NOT matter what\nWAS there in terms of amount. The “nothing” is neither greater nor less because\nof what is ABSENT.\n\nThat is why “all” and “nothing” are dichotomous, WITHOUT A RANGE. This\nis perfectly clear in maximal test performance and for EXACTLY the reason you\nemphasize. You cannot interpret AT ALL, unless you assume either MAXIMAL\nmotivation or its COMPLETE ABSENCE. Only in these two conditions can you validly\nCOMPARE responses, and you MUST assume the former, because if the LATTER is true,\nthe subject WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. Given VARIABLE motivation he WILL do something,\nbut you CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS.\n\nThe RESULTS of tests are evaluated relatively, ASSUMING maximal\nmotivation. But this is because we are dealing with ABILITIES, where degree of\ndevelopment IS meaningful. This does NOT mean that what ability is used FOR is\nnecessarily either limited OR divided. But one thing is certain. Abilities are\nPOTENTIALS for learning, and you will apply them to WHAT YOU WANT\nTO LEARN. Learning is EFFORT, and effort MEANS will.\n\nYou will notice that we have used the term “abilities” as a plural,\nwhich is correct. This is because abilities began with the ego, which perceived\nthem as a POTENTIAL FOR EXCELLING. This is how the ego STILL perceives them and\nuses them. It does NOT want to teach everyone all it has learned, because that\nwould DEFEAT its purpose in learning. Therefore, it does not REALLY learn at all.\nThe Holy Spirit teaches YOU to use what the ego has made to TEACH the opposite of\nwhat the ego has LEARNED. The KIND of learning is as irrelevant as is the\nparticular ability which was applied TO the learning.\n\nYou could not have a better example of the Holy Spirit's (this)\nunified purpose than this course. The Holy Spirit has taken very diversified\nareas of YOUR past learning, and has applied them to a UNIFIED curriculum. The\nfact that this was NOT the ego's reason for learning is totally irrelevant. YOU\nmade the effort to learn, and the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for ALL effort.\nHe ADAPTS the ego's potentials for excelling to potentials for EQUALIZING. This\nmakes them USELESS for the ego's purpose, but VERY useful for His.\n\nIf different abilities are applied long enough to one GOAL, the\nabilities THEMSELVES become unified. This is because they are channelized in one\ndirection, or in one WAY. Ultimately, then, they all contribute to ONE RESULT,\nand by so doing, their SIMILARITY rather than their differences is emphasized.\nYou can EXCEL in many DIFFERENT ways, but you can EQUALIZE in ONE WAY ONLY.\nEquality is NOT a variable state, by definition.\n\nThat is why we once said that papers will be easy to write when you\nhave learned THIS course. To the ego there appears to be no connection, because\nthe EGO is discontinuous. But the Holy Spirit teaches one lesson and applies it\nto ALL individuals in ALL situations. Being conflict free, He maximizes ALL\nefforts and ALL results. By teaching the power of the Kingdom of God Himself, He\nteaches you that ALL POWER IS YOURS. Its application does not matter. It is\nALWAYS maximal. Your vigilance does NOT establish it as yours, but it DOES enable\nyou to use it ALWAYS and in ALL WAYS.\n\nWhen I said, “Behold I am with you always,” I meant it literally. I am\nnot absent to ANYONE nor in ANY situation. BECAUSE I am always with you, YOU are\nthe Way, and the Truth, and the Light. YOU did not make this power any more than",

    "content": "The Recognition of Truth\n\nGod's MEANING waits in the Kingdom because that is where He placed it.\nIt does NOT wait in time. It merely RESTS there (in the Kingdom) because it\nBELONGS there, as YOU do. How can you, who ARE God's meaning, perceive yourselves\nas absent FROM it? You can see yourselves as separated FROM your meaning only by\nEXPERIENCING YOURSELF AS UNREAL. This is WHY the ego is insane; it teaches that\nyou are NOT what you ARE. This is so contradictory that it is clearly impossible.\nIt is therefore a lesson which you CANNOT REALLY LEARN, and therefore CANNOT\nREALLY TEACH. But you ARE always teaching. You MUST, then, be teaching SOMETHING\nELSE AS WELL, even though the ego DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS.\n\nThe ego, then, IS always being undone, and DOES suspect your motives.\nYour mind CANNOT be unified in allegiance to the ego, because the mind does NOT\nBELONG to it. But what is “treacherous” to the ego IS faithful to peace. The\nego's “enemy” is therefore YOUR friend. We said before that the ego's friend is\nnot part of you but that is because the ego perceives itself as at war and\ntherefore in need of allies. YOU, who are NOT at war, must look for brothers and\nRECOGNIZE all you see AS brothers, because ONLY EQUALS ARE AT PEACE.\n\nBecause God's equal Sons have everything, they CANNOT compete. But if\nthey perceive ANY of their brothers as anything OTHER than their perfect equals,\nthe IDEA of competition HAS entered their minds. Do not underestimate your need\nto be vigilant AGAINST this idea, because ALL your conflicts come FROM it. It IS\nthe belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore means that you\nhave accepted the IMpossible as true. How is that different from saying that you\nare perceiving YOURSELF as unreal?\n\nTo be IN the Kingdom is merely to focus your full attention ON it. As\nlong as you believe that you can ATTEND to what is NOT true, you are accepting\nconflict as your CHOICE. IS IT REALLY A CHOICE? It SEEMS to be, but seeming and\nreality are hardly the same. You who ARE the Kingdom are not concerned with\nseeming. Reality is yours because you ARE reality. This is how having and being\nare ultimately reconciled, NOT in the Kingdom, but IN YOUR MINDS. The altar there\nis the ONLY reality. It is PERFECTLY clear in its thought, because it is a\nreflection of PERFECT Thought. It SEES only brothers because it sees ONLY in its\nown Light.\n\nGod has lit your minds Himself, and keeps your mind lit BY His light\nbecause His light is WHAT YOUR MINDS ARE. This is TOTALLY beyond question. And\nwhen YOU questioned it, you WERE answered. The answer merely UNDOES the question\nby establishing the fact that to QUESTION reality is to question MEANINGLESSLY.\nThat is why the Holy Spirit NEVER questions. Its sole function is to UNdo the\nquestionable, and thus LEAD TO CERTAINTY. The certain are perfectly calm, because\nthey are not in doubt. They do NOT raise questions because NOTHING QUESTIONABLE\nENTERS THEIR MINDS. This holds them in perfect serenity because this is what they\nSHARE, KNOWING what they are.\n\nHealing is both an art and a science, as has so often been said. It is\nan art because it depends on inspiration in the sense that we have already used\nthe term. Inspiration is the opposite of dis-spiriting, and therefore means to\nmake joyful. The dis-spirited are depressed because they believe that they are\nliterally “without the Spirit,” which is an illusion. You do not PUT the Spirit\nin them by inspiring them, because that would be “magic,” and therefore would not\nbe real healing. But you DO recognize the Spirit that is ALREADY THERE, and\nthereby REAWAKEN IT. This is why the healer is part of the Resurrection and the\nLIFE. The SPIRIT is not asleep in the minds of the sick, but the part of the mind\nthat can perceive it and be glad IS.\n\nHealing is also a science because it obeys the laws of God, whose laws\nare true. BECAUSE they are true, they are perfectly dependable, and therefore\nuniversal in application. The real aim of science is neither prediction nor\ncontrol, but ONLY UNDERSTANDING. This is because it does NOT establish the laws\nit seeks; CANNOT discover them through prediction, and has NO control over them\nat all. Science is nothing more than an approach to WHAT ALREADY IS. Like\ninspiration, it can be misunderstood as magic, and WILL be whenever it is\nundertaken as SEPARATE from what already is, and perceived as a means for\nESTABLISHING it. To believe this is possible is to believe YOU CAN DO IT. This\ncan ONLY be the voice of the ego.\n\nTruth can only be RECOGNIZED, and NEED only be recognized. Inspiration\nis of the Spirit, and certainty is of God according to His laws. Both therefore\ncome from the same Source, because inspiration comes from the voice FOR God and\ncertainty comes from the laws OF God. Healing does not come DIRECTLY from God,\nwho knows His Creations as perfectly whole. But healing is nevertheless OF God,\nbecause it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws. It is their RESULT in a\nstate of mind which does not know Him. The STATE is unknown to Him, and therefore\ndoes not exist. But those who sleep are stupefied, or better, UNAWARE. And\nBECAUSE they are unaware THEY DO NOT KNOW.\n\nThe Holy Spirit must work THROUGH you to teach you He is IN you. This\nis an intermediary step toward the knowledge that YOU are in God BECAUSE YOU ARE\nPART OF HIM. The miracles which the Holy Spirit inspires CAN have no order,\nbecause every part of Creation IS of one order. This is God's will AND yours.\nThe laws of God ESTABLISH this, and the Holy Spirit reminds you OF it. When you\nheal, you are REMEMBERING THE LAWS OF GOD and FORGETTING the laws of the ego. We\nsaid before that forgetting is merely a way of REMEMBERING BETTER. It is\ntherefore NOT the opposite of remembering, when it is properly conceived.\nPerceived IMproperly, it induces a perception of CONFLICT WITH SOMETHING ELSE, as\nall incorrect perception does. PROPERLY perceived, it can be used as a way OUT of\nconflict, as all proper perception can.\n\nALL abilities, then should be given over to the Holy Spirit, WHO KNOWS\nHOW TO USE THEM PROPERLY. He can use them ONLY for healing, because He knows you\nONLY as whole. BY healing you learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness\nyou learn to remember God. You HAVE forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit still\nknows that YOUR forgetting MUST be translated into a way of remembering, and NOT\nperceived as a SEPARATE ability which OPPOSES AN OPPOSITE. This is the way in\nwhich the ego tries to use ALL abilities, because its goal is ALWAYS to make YOU\nbelieve that YOU are in opposition.\n\nThe ego's goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit's, and it is BECAUSE\nof this that their goals can NEVER be reconciled in ANY way or to ANY extent. The\nego ALWAYS seeks to divide and separate. The Holy Spirit ALWAYS seeks to unify\nand HEAL. As you heal, you ARE healed because the Holy Spirit sees NO ORDER OF\nHEALING. Healing IS the way to undo the belief in differences, because it is the\nONLY way of perceiving the Sonship WITHOUT this belief. This perception is\ntherefore IN accord with the laws of God even in a state of mind which is OUT of\naccord with His.\nBut the strength of right perception is so great that it brings the mind INTO\naccord with His, because it yields to His pull which IS in all of you.\n\nTo oppose the pull or the will of God is not an ability but a real\ndelusion. The ego believes that it HAS this ability, and can offer this ability\nto YOU as a gift. YOU DO NOT WANT IT. It is NOT a gift. It is NOTHING AT ALL. God\nHAS given you a gift, which you both HAVE and ARE. When you do not USE it, you do\nnot know you HAVE it. By not knowing this, you do NOT know what you ARE. Healing,\nthen, is a way of APPROACHING knowledge by THINKING in accordance with the laws\nof God and RECOGNIZING THEIR UNIVERSALITY. WITHOUT this recognition, you have\nmade the laws themselves meaningless TO you. But the LAWS are not meaningless,\nbecause all meaning is contained BY them, and IN them.\n\nSeek ye FIRST the Kingdom of Heaven, because that is where the laws\nof God operate truly, and they can operate ONLY truly, because they are the laws\nof Truth. But SEEK THIS ONLY, because you can FIND nothing else. There IS nothing\nelse. God is all in all in a very literal sense. All being is in Him because He\nIS all Being. YOU are therefore in Him because YOUR being IS His. Healing is a\nway of FORGETTING the sense of danger that the ego has induced in YOU by not\nrecognizing its existence in your brothers. This strengthens the Holy Spirit in\nBOTH of you, because it is a REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE FEAR. Love needs only this\ninvitation. It comes freely to ALL the Sonship, because it is what the Sonship\nIS.",

    "content": "Healing and the Changelessness of Mind\n\nThe body is nothing more than a framework for developing abilities. It\nis therefore a means for developing potentials, which is quite apart from what\nthe potential is used FOR. This IS a decision. The effects of the ego's decision\nin this matter are so apparent that they need no elaboration here. But the Holy\nSpirit's decision to use the body ONLY for communication has such direct\nconnection with healing that it DOES need clarification. The unhealed healer\nOBVIOUSLY does not understand his own vocation.\n\nONLY minds communicate. Since the ego CANNOT obliterate the impulse to\ncommunicate because it is also the impulse to CREATE it can only try to teach you\nthat the BODY can both communicate AND create, and therefore DOES NOT NEED THE\nMIND. The ego, then, tries to teach you that the body can ACT like the mind, and\ntherefore IS self-sufficient. But we have learned that behavior is NOT the level\nfor either teaching OR learning. This MUST be so, because you CAN act in\naccordance with what you do NOT believe. But this will weaken you as teachers AND\nlearners because, as has been repeatedly emphasized, you teach what you DO\nbelieve. An inconsistent lesson WILL be poorly taught and POORLY LEARNED. If you\nteach both sickness AND healing, you ARE both a poor teacher and a poor learner.\n\nHealing is the one ability that everyone CAN develop, and MUST\ndevelop, if he is to BE healed. Healing IS the Holy Spirit's form of\ncommunication, and THE ONLY ONE HE KNOWS. He recognizes no other, because he does\nNOT accept the ego's confusion of mind and body. Minds CAN communicate, but they\nCANNOT hurt. The body in the service of the ego can hurt other BODIES, but this\nCANNOT occur UNLESS the body has ALREADY been confused WITH the mind. This fact,\ntoo, can be used either for healing or for magic, but you must realize that magic\nis ALWAYS the belief that healing is HARMFUL. This is its totally insane premise,\nand so it proceeds accordingly.\n\nHealing ONLY STRENGTHENS. Magic always tries to weaken. Healing\nperceives NOTHING in the healer that everyone else does not share WITH him. Magic\nALWAYS sees something special in the healer, which he believes he can offer as a\ngift to someone who does NOT have it. He may believe that this gift comes from\nGod TO him, but it is quite evident that he does NOT understand God if he thinks\nHE has something that others DO NOT. You might well ask why SOME healing CAN\nresult from this kind of thinking, and there is a real reason for this.\n\nHowever misguided the “magical healer” may be, and however much he may\nbe trying to strengthen his ego, HE IS ALSO TRYING TO HELP. He IS conflicted and\nunstable, but AT TIMES he is offering SOMETHING to the Sonship, and the ONLY\nthing the Sonship can ACCEPT IS healing. When the so-called healing “works,”\nthen, the impulse both to help and BE helped have coincided. This is coincidental,\nbecause the healer may NOT be experiencing HIMSELF as truly helpful\nat the time, and the belief that he IS, in the mind of ANOTHER, HELPS HIM.\n\nThe Holy Spirit does NOT work by chance, and the healing that is of\nHIM ALWAYS works. And unless the healer ALWAYS heals BY Him, the results WILL\nvary. But healing itself IS consistence, because ONLY consistence is conflictfree,\nand only the conflict-free ARE whole. By accepting exceptions, and\nacknowledging that he can SOMETIMES heal and SOMETIMES not, the healer is\nOBVIOUSLY accepting INconsistency. He is therefore IN conflict and TEACHING\nconflict.\n\nCan ANYTHING of God NOT be for all and always? Love is incapable of\nANY exceptions. Only if there is fear does the whole IDEA of exceptions of any\nkind seem to be meaningful. Exceptions ARE fearful because they were made BY\nfear. The “fearful healer” is a contradiction in terms, and is therefore a\nconcept that ONLY a conflicted mind could POSSIBLY perceive as meaningful. Fear\ndoes NOT gladden. Healing DOES. Fear ALWAYS makes exceptions. Healing NEVER does.\nFear produces dissociation because it induces SEPARATION. Healing ALWAYS induces\nharmony because it proceeds from integration.\n\nHealing is predictable BECAUSE it can be counted on. EVERYTHING that\nis of God can be counted on, because everything of God is WHOLLY REAL. HEALING\ncan be counted on BECAUSE it is inspired by His voice, and is in accord with His\nlaws. But if healing IS consistence, it CANNOT be inconsistently understood.\nUnderstanding MEANS consistence, because GOD means consistence. And because that\nIS His Meaning, it is also YOURS. YOUR meaning CANNOT be out of accord with His,\nbecause your whole meaning, and your ONLY meaning, comes FROM His and is LIKE\nHis. God CANNOT be out of accord with HIMSELF, and YOU cannot be out of accord\nwith Him. You cannot separate your SELF from YOUR Creator, who created YOU by\nsharing HIS Being WITH you.\n\nThe unhealed healer wants gratitude FROM his brothers, but he is NOT\ngrateful to them. This is because he thinks he is giving something TO them, and\nis NOT receiving something equally desirable in return. His TEACHING is limited\nbecause he is LEARNING so little. His HEALING lesson is limited by his own\ningratitude, which is a lesson in sickness. Learning is constant and so vital in\nits power for change that a Son of God can recognize his power in an instant, and\nchange the world in the next. That is because by changing HIS mind he has changed\nthe most powerful device that was ever created FOR change.\n\nThis in no way contradicts the changelessness of mind as GOD created\nit. But YOU think that you HAVE changed it, as long as you learn through the ego.\nThis DOES place you in a position of needing to learn a lesson which SEEMS\ncontradictory: you must learn to change your mind ABOUT your mind. Only by this\ncan you learn that it IS changeless.\n\nWhen you heal, that is exactly what you ARE learning (doing). You are\nrecognizing the changeless mind in your brother by perceiving (knowing) that he\ncould NOT have changed his mind. That is how you perceive the Holy Spirit in him.\nIt is ONLY the Holy Spirit in him that never changes His mind. He himself must\nthink he CAN, or he would not perceive himself as sick. He therefore does not\nknow what his self IS. If YOU see only the changeless in him, you have not really\nchanged him at all. But by changing your mind about HIS FOR him, you help him\nundo the change his ego thinks it has made in him. As you can hear two voices, so\nyou can see in two ways. One way shows you an image, or better, an idol which you\nmay worship out of fear, but which you will never love. The other shows you only\ntruth, which you will love because you will UNDERSTAND it. Understanding is\nAPPRECIATION, because what you understand you can identify WITH, and by making it\npart of YOU you have accepted it with love.\nThis is how God Himself created YOU, in understanding, in appreciation, and in\nlove.\n\nThe ego is totally unable to understand this, because it does NOT\nunderstand what it makes. It does NOT appreciate it, and it does NOT love it. It\nincorporates to TAKE AWAY. It literally believes that every time it deprives\nsomeone of something IT has increased. We have spoken often of the INCREASE of\nthe Kingdom by YOUR creations, which can only BE created as YOU were.\n\nThe whole glory and perfect joy that IS the Kingdom lies in you to\ngive. Do you not WANT to give it? You CANNOT forget the Father because I am with\nyou and I CANNOT forget Him. To forget ME is to forget yourself and Him who\ncreated you. Our brothers ARE forgetful. That is why they need your remembrance\nof Me and Him who created Me. Through this remembrance you can change THEIR minds\nabout themselves, as I can change YOURS. Your minds are so powerful a light that\nyou can look into theirs and enlighten them, as I can enlighten yours.\n\nI do not want to share my BODY in communion because this is to share\nnothing. Would I try to share an illusion with the most holy children of a most\nHoly Father? But I do want to share my MIND with you because we ARE of one Mind,\nand that Mind IS ours. See ONLY this Mind everywhere, because only this IS\neverywhere and in everything. It IS everything, because it encompasses all things\nwithin ITSELF. Blessed are you who perceive only this, because you perceive only\nwhat is true. Come therefore unto me and learn of the truth in YOU.\n\nThe mind WE share IS shared by all our brothers, and as we see them\ntruly, they WILL be healed. Let YOUR minds shine with mine upon their minds, and\nby our gratitude to them make THEM aware of the light in THEM. This light will\nshine back upon YOU and on the whole Sonship because this IS your proper gift to\nGod. He will accept it and give it to the Sonship, because it is acceptable to",

    "content": "From Vigilance to Peace\n\nYou can think of the Sonship ONLY as one. This is part of the law of\nCreation, and therefore governs ALL thought. You can PERCEIVE the Sonship as\nfragmented, but it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to see something in part of it that you\nwill not attribute to ALL of it. That is why attack is NEVER discrete. And why\nattack MUST be relinquished entirely. If it is NOT relinquished entirely, it is\nnot relinquished at all. Fear and love are equally reciprocal. They make or\ncreate depending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them,\nbut they WILL return to the mind of the thinker, and they WILL affect his total\nperception. That includes his perception of God, of His Creations, and of his\nown. He will not appreciate ANY of these if he regards them fearfully. He will\nappreciate ALL of them if he regards them with love.\n\nThe mind that accepts attack CANNOT love. This is because it believes\nthat it can DESTROY love, and therefore does not understand what love IS. If it\ndoes not understand what love IS, it CANNOT perceive itself as loving. This loses\nthe awareness of being; induces feelings of unreality; and results in utter\nconfusion. Your own thinking has done this, because of its power. But your own\nthinking can also save you FROM this, because its power is not of your making.\nYour ability to DIRECT your thinking as you will IS part of its power. If you do\nnot believe you can do this, you have DENIED the power of your thought, and thus\nrendered it powerLESS in your belief.\n\nThe ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it\nstems from the power of the mind WHICH THE EGO DENIES. This means that the ego\nattacks WHAT IS PRESERVING IT, and this MUST be a source of extreme anxiety. This\nis why it NEVER knows what it is doing. This is perfectly logical, though clearly\ninsane. The ego draws upon the one source which is totally inimical to its\nexistence FOR its existence. Fearful of perceiving the POWER of this source, it\nis forced to DEPRECIATE it. This threatens its OWN existence, a state which it\nfinds intolerable.\n\nRemaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely\ninsane dilemma in a completely insane way. It does not perceive ITS existence as\nthreatened, by projecting the threat onto YOU, and perceiving your BEING as\nNONexistent. This ensures ITS continuance, if you side WITH it, by guaranteeing\nthat you will NOT know your OWN safety. The ego CANNOT AFFORD TO KNOW ANYTHING.\nKnowledge is total, and the ego DOES NOT BELIEVE IN TOTALITY. This unbelief is\nits own origin, and while the ego does not love YOU, it IS faithful to its own\nantecedent, begetting as it was begotten.\n\nMind ALWAYS REproduces as it was produced. Produced by fear, the ego\nREproduces fear. This IS its allegiance, and this allegiance makes it treacherous\nto love BECAUSE you are love. Love IS your power, which the ego MUST deny. It\nmust also deny everything which this power gives TO you, BECAUSE it gives you\neverything. No-one who has everything WANTS the ego. Its own maker, then, DOES\nNOT WANT IT. Rejection is therefore the only decision which the ego could\nPOSSIBLY encounter if the mind which made it knew ITSELF. And if it recognized\nANY part of the Sonship, it WOULD know itself.\n\nThe ego therefore opposes ALL appreciation, ALL recognition, ALL sane\nperception, and ALL knowledge. It perceives their threat as total because it\nsenses the fact that all commitments which the mind makes ARE total. Forced\ntherefore to detach itself from you who ARE mind, it is willing to attach itself\nto anything ELSE. But there IS nothing else. It does NOT follow, however, that\nthe mind cannot make illusions. But it DOES follow that if it makes illusions it\nwill BELIEVE in them, because THAT IS HOW IT MADE THEM.\n\nThe Holy Spirit undoes illusions without attacking them merely because\nHe cannot perceive them at all. They therefore do not exist for Him. He resolves\nthe APPARENT conflict which they engender by perceiving CONFLICT as meaningless.\nWe said before that the Holy Spirit perceives the conflict EXACTLY AS IT IS, and\nit IS meaningless. The Holy Spirit does not want you to UNDERSTAND conflict. He\nwants you to realize that BECAUSE conflict is meaningLESS it cannot BE\nunderstood. WE have already said that understanding brings appreciation, and\nappreciation brings love. Nothing else CAN be understood because nothing else is\nreal and therefore nothing else HAS meaning.\n\nIf you will keep in mind what the Holy Spirit offers you, you cannot\nbe vigilant for anything BUT God and His Kingdom. The ONLY reason why you find\nthis difficult is because you think there IS something else. Belief does not\nrequire vigilance UNLESS it is conflicted. If it IS, there ARE conflicting\ncomponents within it which have engendered a state of war, and vigilance has\ntherefore BECOME essential. Vigilance has no place at all in peace. It is\nnecessary ONLY AGAINST beliefs which are NOT true, and would never have been\ncalled upon by the Holy Spirit if you had not believed the untrue yourselves.\n\nBut you CANNOT deny that when you BELIEVE something you HAVE made it\ntrue FOR YOU. When YOU believe what God DOES NOT KNOW, your thought seems to\nCONTRADICT His, and this makes it appear AS IF YOU ARE ATTACKING HIM. We have\nrepeatedly emphasized that the ego DOES believe it can attack God, and tries to\npersuade you that YOU have done this. If the mind CANNOT attack, the ego proceeds\nperfectly logically to the position that YOU cannot be mind. By not seeing you as\nYOU are, it can see ITSELF as it WANTS to be. Aware of its weakness, the ego\nwants your allegiance, but NOT as you really are. The ego therefore wants to\nengage your mind in its OWN delusional system, because otherwise the light of\nYOUR understanding WILL dispel it.\n\nThe ego wants no part of truth, because the truth is that IT is not\ntrue. If truth is total, the UNtrue CANNOT exist. Commitment to either MUST be\ntotal, because they cannot co-exist in your minds WITHOUT splitting them. If they\ncannot coexist in peace, and if you WANT peace, you MUST give up the IDEA of\nconflict ENTIRELY, and for ALL TIME. This requires vigilance ONLY as long as YOU\nDO NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT IS TRUE. While you believe that two totally contradictory\nthought systems SHARE truth, your need for vigilance is apparent. Your minds ARE\ndividing their allegiance between two kingdoms, and YOU are totally committed to\nneither.\n\nYour identification with the Kingdom is totally beyond question except\nby you WHEN YOU ARE THINKING INSANELY. What you are is NOT established by your\nperception, and is NOT influenced BY it at all. ALL perceived problems in\nidentification at ANY level ARE NOT PROBLEMS OF FACT. But they ARE problems in\nUNDERSTANDING, because they MEAN that you perceive WHAT you can understand as UP\nTO YOU TO DECIDE. The ego believes THIS totally, being fully committed TO it. But\nit is NOT TRUE. The ego is therefore totally committed to UNtruth, perceiving in\ntotal contradiction to the Holy Spirit and to the knowledge of God.\n\nYou can be perceived with meaning ONLY by the Holy Spirit, because\nyour being IS the knowledge of God. ANY belief that you accept which is APART\nfrom this WILL obscure God's voice in you, and will therefore obscure God TO you.\nUnless you perceive His Creation truly, you CANNOT know the Creator, because God\nand His Creation ARE NOT SEPARATE. The Oneness of the Creator and the Creation IS\nyour wholeness, your sanity, and your limitless power. This limitless power is\nGod's gift to you, because it is WHAT YOU ARE. If you dissociate your mind FROM\nit, you are perceiving the most powerful force in the universe of thought AS IF\nit were weak, because you do NOT believe YOU are part of it.\n\nPerceived WITHOUT your part IN it, God's Creation IS perceived as\nweak, and those who SEE themselves as weakened DO attack. The attack MUST be\nblind, because there is nothing TO attack. Therefore, they make up images,\nperceive them as unworthy, and attack them for their unworthiness. That is all\nthe world of the ego is. NOTHING. It has no meaning. It does not exist. Do not\nTRY to understand it, because if you do you are believing that it CAN be\nunderstood, and therefore is capable of being appreciated and loved. This WOULD\njustify it, but it CANNOT BE justified. YOU cannot make the meaningLESS\nmeaningFUL. This can ONLY be an insane attempt.\n\nAllowing INsanity to enter your minds means that you have not judged\nsanity AS WHOLLY DESIRABLE. If you WANT something else, you WILL MAKE something\nelse. But because it IS something else it WILL attack your thought system and\ndivide your allegiance. You CANNOT create in this divided state, and you MUST be\nvigilant AGAINST this divided state because ONLY peace CAN BE extended. Your\ndivided minds ARE blocking the extension of the Kingdom, and its extension IS\nyour joy. If you do not extend the Kingdom, you are NOT thinking with your\nCreator and creating as He created.\n\nIn this depressing state, the Holy Spirit reminds you gently that you\nare sad because you are not fulfilling your function as co-creators WITH God, and\nare therefore depriving YOURSELVES of joy. This is not God's will, but YOURS. If\nyour will is out of accord with God's, YOU ARE WILLING WITHOUT MEANING. But\nbecause ONLY God's will is unchangeable, no REAL conflict of will is possible.\nThis is the Holy Spirit's perfectly consistent teaching. Creation, not\nseparation, IS your will BECAUSE it is God's. And nothing that opposes this means",

    "content": "The Total Commitment\n\nWhenever you deny a blessing to a brother, YOU will feel deprived.\nThis is because denial is as total as love. It is as impossible to deny part of\nthe Sonship as it is to love it in part. Nor is it possible to love it totally AT\nTIMES. You CANNOT be totally committed SOMETIMES. Remember a very early lesson, -\n- “never underestimate the power of denial.” It has no power in ITSELF, but YOU\ncan give it the power of YOUR mind, whose power is without limit of ANY kind. If\nyou use it to deny reality, reality is gone FOR YOU. REALITY CANNOT BE PARTLY\nAPPRECIATED. That is why denying any part of it means you have lost awareness of\nALL of it.\n\nThat is the negative side of the law as it operates in this world. But\ndenial is a defense, and so it is as capable of being used positively as it is of\nbeing used destructively. Used negatively, it WILL be destructive, because it\nwill be used for attack. But in the service of the Holy Spirit, the law becomes\nas beneficent as all of the laws of God. Stated positively, the law requires you\nonly to recognize PART of reality to appreciate ALL of it. Mind is too powerful\nto be subject to exclusion. You will NEVER be able to exclude yourself from what\nyou project.\n\nWhen a brother acts insanely, he is offering you an opportunity to\nbless him. His need is YOURS. YOU need the blessing you can offer him. There is\nno way for you to have it EXCEPT by giving it. This IS the law of God, and it HAS\nNO EXCEPTIONS. What you deny you LACK, not because it IS lacking, but because you\nhave denied it in another, and therefore are not aware of it in YOU. Every\nresponse you make is determined by what you think you ARE. And what you WANT to\nbe IS what you think you are. Therefore, what you WANT to be determines every\nresponse you make.\n\nYou do NOT need God's blessing, because that you have forever. But you\nDO need YOURS. The picture you see of yourselves is deprived, unloving, and very\nvulnerable. You CANNOT love this. But you can very easily escape FROM it, or\nbetter, leave it behind. You are NOT there, and that is not YOU. Do not see this\npicture in anyone, or you HAVE accepted it as you. ALL illusions about the\nSonship are DISPELLED together, as they were MADE together. Teach no-one that HE\nis what YOU do not want to be. Your brother is the mirror in which you will see\nthe image of yourself as long as perception lasts. And perception WILL last until\nthe Sonship knows itself as whole.\n\nYou MADE perception, and it MUST last as long as you WANT it.\nIllusions are investments. They will last as long as you value them. Values are\nrelative, but they are powerful because they are MENTAL JUDGMENTS. The only way\nto dispel illusions is to withdraw ALL investment from them, and they will HAVE\nno life for you because you have put them OUT OF YOUR MIND. While you include\nthem IN it, you are GIVING them life. Except there is nothing there to receive\nyour gift.\n\nThe gift of life IS yours to give, because it was given YOU. You are\nunaware of YOUR gift BECAUSE you do not give it. You CANNOT make nothing live,\nbecause it cannot BE enlivened. Therefore, you have NOT extended the gift you\nboth have and are, and so you do NOT know your being. All confusion comes from\nnot extending life, because this is NOT the will of your Creator. You CAN do\nnothing apart from Him, and you DO do nothing apart from him. Keep His Way to\nremember yourselves, and teach His Ways lest you forget yourself. Give only honor\nto the sons of the living God, and count yourself among them gladly.\n\nONLY honor is a fitting gift for those whom God Himself created worthy\nof honor and whom He honors. Give them the appreciation which God accords them\nalways, because they are His Beloved Sons in whom He is well pleased. You CANNOT\nbe apart from them, because you are not apart from Him. Rest in His love, and\nprotect your rest by loving. But love EVERYTHING He created, of which YOU are\npart, or you cannot learn of His peace and accept His gift FOR yourself and AS\nyourself.\nYou CANNOT know your own perfection until you have honored all those who were\ncreated LIKE you.\n\nOne Child of God is the only teacher sufficiently worthy to teach\nanother. One Teacher is in all your minds, and He teaches the same lesson to all.\nHe always teaches you the inestimable worth of EVERY Son of God, teaching it with\ninfinite patience born of the Love of Him for whom He speaks. Every attack is a\ncall for His patience, because ONLY His patience can translate attack into\nblessing. Those who attack DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE BLESSED. They attack BECAUSE THEY\nBELIEVE THEY ARE DEPRIVED. Give therefore of YOUR abundance, and teach them\nTHEIRS. Do not share their delusions of scarcity, or you will perceive YOURSELF\nas lacking.\n\nAttack could never PROMOTE attack unless you perceived it as a means\nof depriving you of SOMETHING YOU WANT. But you cannot lose ANYTHING unless YOU\ndo not value it and therefore DO NOT WANT IT. This makes you feel DEPRIVED of it,\nand by projecting YOUR rejection, you believe that others are TAKING IT FROM YOU.\nOne MUST be fearful if he believes that his brother is attacking him to tear the\nKingdom of Heaven from him.\n\nThis is the ultimate basis for ALL of the ego's projection. Being the\npart of your mind which does NOT believe it is responsible for ITSELF, and being\nwithout allegiance to God, it is incapable of trust. Projecting its insane belief\nthat YOU have been treacherous to YOUR Creator, it believes that your brothers,\nwho are as incapable of this as you are, are out to TAKE GOD FROM YOU.\nWhenever a brother attacks another, THIS IS WHAT HE BELIEVES. Projection ALWAYS\nsees YOUR will in others. If you will to separate YOURSELF from God, that is what\nyou will think others are doing TO you.\n\nYou ARE the will of God. Do not accept anything else AS YOUR will, or\nyou ARE denying what you are. Deny THIS and you WILL attack, because you believe\nyou have BEEN attacked. But see the love of God in you, and you will see it\neverywhere because it IS everywhere. See His abundance in everyone, and you will\nknow that you are in Him WITH them. They are part of you as you are part of God.\nYOU are as lonely without understanding this as God Himself is lonely when His\nSons do not know Him. The peace of God IS understanding this.\n\nThere is only one way out of the world's thinking, just as there was\nonly one way INTO it. Understand totally by understanding TOTALITY. Perceive ANY\npart of the ego's thought system as wholly insane, wholly delusional, and wholly\nundesirable, and you have CORRECTLY EVALUATED ALL OF IT. This correction enables\nyou to perceive ANY part of Creation as wholly real, wholly perfect, and WHOLLY\nDESIRABLE. Wanting this ONLY, you will HAVE this only, and giving this only, you\nwill BE only this. The gifts you offer to the ego are ALWAYS experienced as",

    "content": "The Defense of Conflict\n\nWe once said that without projection there can be no anger, but it is\nalso true that without projection there can be no love. Projection is a\nfundamental law of the mind, and therefore one which ALWAYS operates. It is the\nlaw by which you create and were created. It is the law which unifies the Kingdom\nand keeps it in the mind of God. To the ego, the law is perceived as a way of\ngetting RID of something it does NOT want. To the Holy Spirit, it is the\nfundamental law of sharing, by which you give what you value in order to keep it\nin your OWN minds.\n\nProjection to the Holy Spirit is the law of extension. To the ego, it\nis the law of deprivation. It therefore produces abundance or scarcity, depending\non how you choose to apply it. This choice IS up to you, but it is NOT up to you\nto decide whether or not you will UTILIZE projection. Every mind MUST project,\nbecause that is how it lives, and every mind IS life. The ego's use of projection\nmust be fully understood before the INEVITABLE association between projection and\nanger can be finally UNmade.\n\nThe ego ALWAYS tries to preserve conflict. It is very ingenious in\ndevising ways which SEEM to diminish conflict only because it does NOT want you\nto find it so intolerable that you will INSIST on giving it up. Therefore, it\ntries to persuade you that IT can free you OF conflict, lest you give IT up and\nfree YOURSELF. The ego, using its own warped version of the laws of God, uses the\npower of the mind ONLY to defeat the mind's real purpose. It projects conflict\nFROM your mind to OTHER minds, in an attempt to persuade you that you have gotten\nRID of it. This has a number of fallacies which may not be so apparent.\n\nStrictly speaking, conflict cannot BE projected, precisely BECAUSE it\ncannot be fully shared. Any attempt to keep PART of it and get rid of ANOTHER\npart does not really mean ANYTHING. Remember that a conflicted teacher is a poor\nteacher AND A POOR LEARNER. His lessons are confused, and their transfer value\nseverely limited BY his confusion.\n\nA second fallacy is the idea that you can GET RID of something you do\nnot want BY giving it away. GIVING it is how you KEEP it. The belief that by\ngiving it OUT you have excluded from WITHIN is a complete distortion of the power\nof EXTENSION.\n\nThat is why those who project from the ego are vigilant for their OWN\nsafety. THEY ARE AFRAID THAT THEIR PROJECTIONS WILL RETURN AND HURT THEM. They DO\nbelieve they have blotted them out of their OWN minds, but they also believe they\nare trying to creep back INTO them. This is because their projections have NOT\nleft their minds, and this, in turn, forces them to engage in compulsive activity\nin order NOT to recognize this.\n\nYou cannot perpetuate an illusion about another WITHOUT perpetuating\nit about yourself. There is no way out of this, because it is IMPOSSIBLE to\nfragment the mind. To fragment is to break into pieces, and mind CANNOT attack.\nThe belief that it CAN, a fallacy which the ego ALWAYS makes, underlies its whole\nuse of projection. This is because it does not understand what the mind IS, and\ntherefore does not understand what YOU are. Yet ITS existence IS dependent on\nyour mind, because it is a BELIEF. The ego IS therefore a confusion in\nidentification, which never had a consistent model, and never developed\nconsistently. It is the distorted product of the misapplication of the laws of\nGod by distorted minds which are misusing their own power.\n\nDO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE EGO. It DOES depend on your mind, and as you\nmade it by believing in it, so you can dispel it by withdrawing belief FROM it.\nDo NOT project the responsibility for your belief in it onto ANYONE else, or you\nwill PRESERVE the belief. When you are willing to accept sole responsibility for\nthe ego's existence YOURSELF, you will have laid aside all anger and all attack,\nbecause they COME from an attempt to PROJECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN ERRORS.\nBut having ACCEPTED the error\nas yours, DO NOT KEEP THEM. Give them over quickly to the Holy Spirit to be\nundone completely, so that ALL their effects will vanish from your minds and from\nthe Sonship AS A WHOLE. He will teach you to perceive BEYOND belief, because\ntruth IS beyond belief and His perception IS true.\n\nThe ego can be completely forgotten at ANY time, because it was always\na belief that is totally incredible. No-one can KEEP a belief he has judged to be\nunbelievable. The more you learn ABOUT the ego, the more you realize that it\ncannot BE believed. The incredible cannot BE understood because it IS\nunbelievable. The utter meaninglessness of ALL perception which comes from the\nunbelievable MUST be apparent, but it is NOT beyond belief because it was made BY\nbelief.\n\nThe whole purpose of this course is to teach you that the ego is\nunbelievable and will forever BE unbelievable. You who made the ego by BELIEVING\nthe unbelievable CANNOT make this judgment alone. By accepting the Atonement for\nYOURSELF, you are deciding AGAINST the belief that you can BE alone, thus\ndispelling the idea of separation and affirming your true identification with the",

    "content": "The Extension of the Kingdom\n\nOnly you can limit your creative power, but God wills to release it.\nHe no more wills you to deprive yourselves of YOUR creations than He wills to\ndeprive Himself of His.\n\nDo not withhold your gifts to the Sonship, or you withhold yourself\nfrom God. Selfishness is of the ego but self-fullness is of the Soul because that\nis how He created it. The Holy Spirit is the part of the mind that lies between\nthe ego and the Soul, mediating between them ALWAYS IN FAVOR OF THE SOUL. To the\nego this is partiality, and it therefore responds as if it were the part that is\nbeing sided AGAINST.\nTo the Soul this is truth, because it knows its own fullness and cannot conceive\nof ANY part from which it is excluded. The soul KNOWS that the consciousness of\nall its brothers is included in its own, as IT is included in God. The power of\nthe whole Sonship AND OF ITS CREATOR is therefore its OWN fullness, rendering its\nCreation and its creating equally whole and equal in perfection.\n\nThe ego cannot prevail against a totality which includes God, and any\ntotality MUST include God. Everything He created is given ALL His power because\nit is part of Him and shares His Being WITH Him. Creating is the OPPOSITE of\nloss, as blessing is the opposite of sacrifice. Being MUST be extended. That is\nhow it retains the knowledge of itSELF. The soul yearns to share ITS Being as ITS\nCreator did. Created BY sharing, its will is to create. It does NOT wish to\nCONTAIN God, but to EXTEND HIS BEING.\n\nThe extension of God's Being is the Soul's only function. ITS fullness\ncannot be contained any more than can the fullness of its Creator. Fullness IS\nextension. The ego's whole thought system BLOCKS extension, and therefore blocks\nYOUR ONLY FUNCTION. It therefore blocks your joy and THIS is why you perceive\nyourselves as unfulfilled. Unless you create, you ARE unfulfilled. But God does\nNOT know unfulfillment, and therefore you MUST create. YOU may not know your own\ncreations, but this can no more interfere with their reality than your\nunawareness of your Soul can interfere with its being.\n\nThe Kingdom is forever extending, because it is in the Mind of God.\nYOU do not know your joy because you do not know your own self-fullness. Exclude\nANY part of the Kingdom FROM yourself, and you are NOT whole. A split mind CANNOT\nperceive its fullness, and needs the miracle OF its wholeness to dawn upon it and\nheal it. This reawakens its wholeness IN it and restores it to the Kingdom\nbecause of its ACCEPTANCE of wholeness. The full appreciation of its selffullness\nmakes selfishness impossible, and extension inevitable.\nThat is why there is perfect peace in the Kingdom. Every Soul IS fulfilling its\nfunction, and ONLY complete fulfillment IS peace.\n\nInsanity APPEARS to add to reality, but no-one would claim that what\nit adds is true. Insanity is therefore the NONextension of truth, which blocks\njoy because it blocks Creation and therefore blocks self-FULFILLMENT. The\nunfulfilled MUST be depressed, because their self-fullness is UNKNOWN to them.\nYour creations are protected FOR you because the Holy Spirit, Who is in your\nminds, knows of them, and can bring them INTO your awareness whenever you will\nlet Him. They ARE there as part of your own being, because YOUR fulfillment\nINCLUDES them. The creations of every Son of God are yours, because every\ncreation belongs to everyone, being created for the Sonship as a whole.\n\nYou have not failed to add to the inheritance of the Sons of God, and\nthus have not failed to secure it for yourselves. If it was the will of God to\ngive it to you, He gave it forever. If it was His will that you have it forever,\nHe gave you the means for keeping it, and YOU HAVE DONE SO. Disobeying God's will\nis meaningful only to the insane. In truth, it is impossible.\n\nYour self-fullness is as boundless as God's. Like His, it extends\nforever and in perfect peace. Its radiance is so intense that it creates in\nperfect joy, and only the whole can be born of its wholeness. Be confident that\nyou have never lost your identity and the extension which maintains it in\nwholeness and peace. Miracles are AN EXPRESSION OF THIS CONFIDENCE. They are\nreflections both of your own proper identification WITH your brothers, and of\nyour own awareness that YOUR identification IS maintained by extension. The\nmiracle is A LESSON IN TOTAL PERCEPTION. By including ANY part of totality in the\nlesson, you HAVE included the whole.\n\nYou have said that, when you write of the Kingdom and your own\ncreations which belong to it, you are describing WHAT YOU DO NOT KNOW. This is\ntrue in a sense, but no more true than your failure to acknowledge the whole\nresult of the ego's premises. The Kingdom is the result of premises, as much as\nthis world is. You HAVE carried the ego's reasoning to its logical conclusion,\nwhich is TOTAL CONFUSION ABOUT EVERYTHING. But you do not really BELIEVE this, or\nyou could not possibly maintain it. If you REALLY saw this result, you COULD not\nwant it. The ONLY reason why you could possibly want ANY part of it is because\nYOU DO NOT SEE THE WHOLE OF IT.\n\nYou therefore ARE willing to look at the ego's premises but NOT at\ntheir logical outcome. Is it not possible that you have done the same thing with\nthe premises of God? Your creations ARE the logical outcome of His premises. HIS\nthinking has established them FOR you. They are therefore THERE, EXACTLY where\nthey belong. They belong to your mind, as part of your identification with HIS.\nBut your state of mind and your recognition of WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND depends, at\nany given moment, on what you believe ABOUT your mind. Whatever these beliefs may\nbe, they are the premises which will determine WHAT YOU ACCEPT INTO YOUR MINDS.\n\nIt is surely clear that you can both accept into your minds what is\nNOT really there, and DENY WHAT IS. Neither of these possibilities requires\nfurther elaboration, although both are clearly indefensible even if YOU elect to\ndefend them. But the function which God Himself GAVE your minds through His you\nmay DENY but you CANNOT prevent. They are the logical outcome of what you ARE.\nThe ability to SEE a logical outcome depends on the WILLINGNESS TO SEE IT, but\nits TRUTH has nothing to do with your willingness at all. Truth is GOD'S will.\nSHARE His Will, and you will share what He KNOWS. Deny His Will AS YOURS, and you\nare denying His Kingdom AND yours.\n\nThe Holy Spirit will direct you ONLY so as to avoid all pain. The",

    "content": "The Confusion of Strength and Weakness\n\nYou no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful,\nand are, in fact, very apt to confuse them. The Holy Spirit's main function is to\nteach you to TELL THEM APART.\n\nHowever strange it may seem that this is necessary, it obviously IS.\nThe reason is equally obvious. What is joyful to you IS painful to the ego, and\nas long as you are in doubt about what YOU are, you WILL be confused about joy\nand pain. This confusion is the cause of the whole idea of sacrifice. Obey the\nHoly Spirit, and you WILL be giving up the ego, but you will be SACRIFICING\nnothing. On the contrary, you will be gaining EVERYTHING. But if you BELIEVED\nthis there would BE no conflict. That is why you need to DEMONSTRATE THE OBVIOUS\nTO YOURSELF. It is NOT obvious to you.\n\nYou REALLY believe that doing the opposite of God's will CAN be better\nfor you. You also believe that it is POSSIBLE to do the opposite of God's will.\nTherefore, you believe that an impossible choice IS open to you, which is both\nvery fearful and very desirable. But God WILLS. He does NOT wish. YOUR will is as\npowerful as His because it IS His. The ego's wishes do not mean anything, because\nthe ego wishes for the impossible. You CAN wish for the impossible, but you can\nonly WILL with God. This is the ego's weakness and YOUR strength.\n\nThe Holy Spirit ALWAYS sides with YOU and with your STRENGTH. As long\nas you avoid His guidance in any way, you WANT TO BE WEAK. But weakness IS\nfrightening. What else, then, can this decision mean except that you WANT to be\nfearful? The Holy Spirit NEVER asks for sacrifice, but the ego ALWAYS does. When\nyou are confused about this VERY clear distinction in motivation, it CAN only be\ndue to projection. Projection of this kind IS a confusion in motivation, and\ngiven THIS confusion, TRUST becomes impossible.\n\nNo-one obeys gladly a guide he does not trust. But this does not mean\nthat the GUIDE is untrustworthy. In this case, it ALWAYS means that the FOLLOWER\nIS. However, this, too, is merely a matter of his own belief. Believing that HE\ncan betray, he believes that everything can betray HIM. But this is ONLY because\nhe has ELECTED TO FOLLOW FALSE GUIDANCE. Unable to follow THIS guidance WITHOUT\nfear, he associates fear WITH guidance, and refuses to follow ANY guidance at\nall. If the result of this decision is confusion, this is hardly surprising.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is perfectly trustworthy, as YOU are. God Himself\ntrusts you and therefore your trustworthiness IS beyond question. It will always\nremain beyond question, however much you may question it. I trust MY choices ONLY\nbecause they ARE God's Will. We said before that YOU are the will of God. His\nwill is not an idle wish, and your identification WITH His Will is not optional\nbecause it IS what you are. Sharing His will WITH me is not really open to choice\nat all, though it may SEEM to be. The whole separation lies in this fallacy. And\nthe ONLY way out of the fallacy is to decide that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DECIDE\nANYTHING.\n\nEverything has been given you by GOD'S decision. This IS His Will, and\nyou can NOT undo it. Even the relinquishment of your false decision-making\nprerogative, which the ego guards so jealously, is not accomplished by your wish.\nIt was accomplished FOR you by the Will of God, who has not left you comfortless.\nHis Voice WILL teach you how to distinguish between pain and joy, and lead you\nout of the confusion YOU have made. There IS no confusion in the mind of a Son of\nGod, whose will MUST be the will of the Father, because the Father's Will IS His\nSon.\n\nMiracles are IN ACCORD with the Will of God, whose will you do NOT\nknow because you are confused about what YOU will. This MEANS that you are\nconfused about what you are. If you ARE God's will and do NOT ACCEPT His will,\nyou can ONLY be not accepting what you are. But if your joy IS what you are, you\nARE denying joy. The miracle therefore is a lesson in WHAT JOY IS. Being a lesson",

    "content": "The State of Grace\n\nThe Holy Spirit will ALWAYS guide you truly, because YOUR joy IS His.\nThis is His will for everyone, because He speaks for the Kingdom of God which IS\njoy. Following Him is therefore the easiest thing in the world, and the only\nthing which IS easy, because it is NOT of the world and is therefore NATURAL. The\nworld goes AGAINST your nature, because it is out of accord with God's laws. The\nworld perceives orders of difficulty in EVERYTHING. This is because the ego\nperceives nothing as wholly desirable. By DEMONSTRATING to yourselves that THERE\nIS NO ORDER OF DIFFICULTY IN MIRACLES, you will convince yourselves that in your\nNATURAL state there IS no difficulty, because it is a state of Grace.\n\nGrace is the natural state of every Son of God. When he is NOT in a\nstate of grace he IS out of his natural environment, and does NOT function well.\nEverything he does becomes a strain, because he was not created for the\nenvironment which he has made. He therefore CANNOT adapt to it, nor can he adapt\nIT to HIM. There is no point in trying. A Son of God is happy ONLY when he knows\nhe is WITH God. That is the only environment in which he will not experience\nstrain, because that is where he belongs. It is also the only environment that is\nworthy of him, because his own worth is beyond ANYTHING that he can make.\n\nConsider the Kingdom which YOU have made, and judge its worth fairly.\nIs it worthy to be a home for a Child of God? Does it protect his peace, and\nshine love upon him? Does it keep his heart untouched by fear, and allow him to\ngive always without any sense of loss? Does it teach him that this giving IS his\njoy, and that God Himself thanks him for his giving?\n\nThat is the only environment in which you can be happy. You cannot\nmake it, any more than you can make yourselves. But it has been created for you,\nas you were created for it. God watches over His children and denies them\nnothing. But when they deny Him they do NOT know this, because THEY deny\nthemselves everything. You who could give the love of God to everything you see\nand touch and remember are literally denying Heaven to yourselves. I call upon\nyou again to remember that I have chosen you to teach the Kingdom TO the Kingdom.\nThere are no exceptions to this lesson because the lack of exceptions IS the\nlesson.\n\nEvery Son who returns to the Kingdom with this lesson in his heart has\nhealed the Sonship and given thanks to God. Everyone who learns this lesson has\nbecome the perfect teacher, because he has learned it of the Holy Spirit, who\nwants to teach him everything He knows. When a mind has only light, it KNOWS only\nlight. Its own radiance shines all around it, and\nextends out into the darkness of other minds, transforming them into majesty. The\nmajesty of God is there, for YOU to recognize and appreciate and KNOW.\n\nPerceiving the majesty of God AS your brother is to accept your OWN\ninheritance. God gives only equally. If you recognize His gift to anyone ELSE,\nyou have acknowledged what He has given YOU. Nothing is as easy to perceive as\ntruth. This is the perception which is immediate, clear, and natural. You have\ntrained yourselves NOT to see it, and this HAS been very difficult for you. OUT\nof your natural environment you may well ask, “what is truth?” because truth IS\nthe environment by which and for which you were created. You do not know\nyourselves because you do not know YOUR Creator. You do not know YOUR creations,\nbecause you do not know your brothers who created them WITH you.\n\nWe said before that only the whole Sonship is a worthy co-creator with\nGod, because only the whole Sonship can create LIKE Him. Whenever you heal a\nbrother by recognizing his worth, you are acknowledging HIS power to create and\nYOURS. HE cannot have lost what YOU recognize, and you MUST have the glory you\nsee in HIM. He is a co-creator with God with YOU. Deny his creative power and you\nare denying yours AND THAT OF GOD WHO CREATED YOU. You cannot deny part of the\ntruth. You do not know your creations because you do not know their creator. You\ndo not know yourselves because you do not know YOURS.\n\nYour creations cannot establish your reality, any more than YOU can establish\nGod's. But you can KNOW both. Being is known by sharing. Because God shared His\nBeing with you, you can know Him. But you must also know all He created to know\nwhat THEY have shared. Without your Father you will not know your fatherhood. The",

You cannot\nreasonably object to following instructions in a course FOR knowing, on the\ngrounds that you do not know. The need for the course is implicit in your\nobjection. Knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course. PEACE is. As\nthe PREREQUISITE for knowledge, peace MUST be learned. This is ONLY because those\nwho are in conflict are not peaceful, and peace is the CONDITION of knowledge\nbecause it is the condition of the Kingdom.\n\nKnowledge will be restored when YOU meet its conditions. This is not a\nbargain made by God, who made no bargains at all. It is merely the result of your\nmisuse of His Laws on behalf of a will that was not His. Knowledge IS His Will.\nIf you are OPPOSING His Will, how CAN you have knowledge? I have told you what\nknowledge OFFERS you, but it is clear that you do NOT regard this as wholly\ndesirable. If you did, you would hardly be willing to throw it away so readily,\nwhen the ego asks for your allegiance.\n\nThe distraction of the ego SEEMS to interfere with your learning, but\nit HAS no power to distract unless you GIVE it the power.

This is a condition\nwhich is so ALIEN to the Kingdom that you CANNOT understand the state which\nprevails WITHIN it.\n\nYour past learning MUST have taught you the wrong things, simply\nbecause it has not made you happy. On this basis alone, its value should be\nquestioned. If learning aims at CHANGE, and that is ALWAYS its purpose, are you\nsatisfied with the changes YOURS has brought you?

    "content": "The Rationale for Choice\n\nThere IS a rationale for choice. Only ONE teacher KNOWS what your\nreality is. If learning that is the PURPOSE of the curriculum, you MUST learn it\nof Him. The ego does NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS TRYING TO TEACH. It is trying to teach\nyou what you are WITHOUT KNOWING IT. The ego is expert ONLY in confusion. It does\nnot understand ANYTHING ELSE. As a teacher, then, it is totally confused and\nTOTALLY CONFUSING.\n\nEven if you could disregard the Holy Spirit entirely, which is quite\nimpossible, you could learn nothing from the ego, because the ego KNOWS nothing.\nIs there ANY possible reason for choosing a teacher such as this? Does the TOTAL\ndisregard of ANYTHING it teaches make anything BUT sense? Is THIS the teacher to\nwhom a Son of God should turn to find HIMSELF? The ego has never given you a\nsensible answer to anything.\nSimply on the grounds of your own experience with the ego's teaching, should not\nthis alone disqualify it as your future teacher?\n\nBut the ego has done more harm to your learning than this alone.\nLearning is joyful if it leads you along your natural path, and facilitates the\ndevelopment of WHAT YOU HAVE. But when you are taught AGAINST your nature, you\nwill lose by your learning, because your learning will IMPRISON you. Your will is\nIN your nature, and therefore CANNOT go AGAINST it. The ego cannot teach you\nanything as long as your will is free, because you WILL NOT LISTEN TO IT. It is\nNOT your will to be imprisoned, BECAUSE your will is free.\n\nThat is why the ego IS the denial of free will. It is NEVER God Who\ncoerces you, because He SHARES His Will WITH you. His voice teaches ONLY His\nWill, but that is not the Holy Spirit's lesson, because that is what you ARE. The\nLESSON is that your will and God's CANNOT be out of accord because they ARE one.\nThis is the UNdoing of EVERYTHING the ego tries to teach. It is not, then, only\nthe DIRECTION (of the curriculum?) which must be unconflicted, but also the\nCONTENT.\n\nThe ego wants to teach you that you want to OPPOSE God's Will. This\nunnatural lesson CANNOT be learned, but the ATTEMPT to learn it is a violation of\nyour own freedom, and makes you AFRAID of your will BECAUSE it is free. The Holy\nSpirit opposes ANY imprisoning of the will of a Son of God, KNOWING that the will\nof the Son IS the Father's. He leads you steadily along the path of freedom,\nteaching you how to disregard, or look beyond EVERYTHING that would hold you\nback.\n\nWe said before that the Holy Spirit teaches you the difference between\npain and joy. That is the same as saying that He teaches you the difference\nbetween imprisonment and freedom. YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS DISTINCTION WITHOUT HIM.\nThat is because you have taught YOURSELF that imprisonment IS freedom. Believing\nthem to be the same, how can you tell them apart? Can you ask the part of your\nmind that taught you to believe they ARE the same to teach you the DIFFERENCE?\n\nThe Holy Spirit's teaching takes only one direction, and has only one\ngoal. His direction is freedom, and His goal is God. But He cannot conceive of\nGod without YOU, because it was not God's Will to BE without you. When you have\nlearned that your will IS God's, you could no more will to be without Him than He\ncould will to be without YOU. This IS freedom and this IS joy. Deny YOURSELF\nthis, and you ARE denying God His Kingdom, because He created you FOR this.\n\nWhen we said, “all power and glory are yours because the Kingdom is\nHis,” this is what we meant: The Will of God is without limit, and all power and\nglory lie within it. It is boundless in strength and in love and in peace. It has\nno boundaries because its extension is unlimited, and it encompasses all things\nbecause it CREATED all things. By CREATING all things, it made them PART OF\nITSELF. YOU are the Will of God, because this is how you were created. Because\nyour Creator creates only like Himself, you ARE like Him.\n\nYou are part of Him who IS all power and glory, and are therefore as\nunlimited as He is. To what else EXCEPT all power and glory can the Holy Spirit\nappeal to restore God's Kingdom? His appeal, then, is merely to what the Kingdom\nis, and for its own acknowledgment of what it is. When you acknowledge THIS, you\nbring the acknowledgment automatically to everyone, because YOU HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED\nEVERYONE. By your recognition you awaken theirs, and through theirs YOURS is",

Ask for\nlight and learn that you ARE light. If you WANT understanding and enlightenment\nyou WILL learn it, because your will to learn it is your decision to listen to\nthe Teacher who KNOWS of light and can therefore TEACH IT TO YOU.\n\nThere is no limit on your learning, because there is no limit on your\nMINDS. There is no limit on His will to teach, because He was created by\nunlimited Will in ORDER to teach. KNOWING His function perfectly, He wills to\nfulfill it perfectly, because that is His joy AND YOURS. To fulfill the Will of\nGod perfectly is the only joy and peace that can be fully KNOWN, because it is\nthe only function that can be FULLY EXPERIENCED. When this is accomplished, then,\nthere IS no other experience. But the WISH for other experience will block this,\nbecause God's Will CANNOT be forced upon you, being an experience of total\nWILLINGNESS.\n\nThe Holy Spirit knows how to teach this, but YOU do not. That is why\nyou need Him, and why God gave Him TO you. Only HIS teaching will release your\nwill to God's, uniting it with His power and glory, and establishing them as\nyours. You will share them as He shares them, because this is the natural outcome\nof their being. The Will of the Father and of the Son are one together BY THEIR\nEXTENSION. Their extension is the RESULT of their Oneness, holding THEIR unity by\nextending their JOINT will.\n\nThis is perfect creation by the perfectly created in union with the\nPerfect Creator. The Father MUST give fatherhood to His Sons, because His Own\nFatherhood must be extended outward. You who belong in God have the holy function\nof extending His Fatherhood by placing no limits upon it. Let the Holy Spirit\nteach you HOW to do this, for you will know what it MEANS of God Himself.\n\nWhen you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him,\nyou will see yourself. As you treat him, you will treat yourself. As you think of\nhim, you will think of yourself. Never forget this, for in him you will find\nyourself or lose sight of yourself. Whenever two Sons of God meet they are given\nanother chance at Salvation. Do not leave anyone without giving salvation TO him\nand receiving it yourself. For I am always there WITH you, in remembrance of YOU.\n\nThe goal of the curriculum, regardless of the teacher you choose, is\nKNOW THYSELF. There is nothing else to learn. Everyone is looking for himself and\nthe power and glory he thinks he has lost. Whenever you are with anyone ELSE, you\nhave another opportunity to find them. Your power and glory are in HIM BECAUSE\nthey are yours. The ego tries to find them in YOURSELF, because he does not\nknow where to look. But the Holy Spirit teaches you that if you look only at\nyourself you CANNOT find yourself because that is NOT what you are.\n\nWhenever you are with a brother you are learning what you are, because\nyou are TEACHING what you are. He will respond either with pain or with joy,\ndepending on which teacher YOU are following. HE will be imprisoned or released\naccording to your decision, AND SO WILL YOU. Never forget your responsibility to\nhim, because it is your responsibility to YOURSELF. Give him HIS place in the\nKingdom, and you will have YOURS. The Kingdom CANNOT be found alone, and you who\nARE the Kingdom cannot find YOURSELVES alone.\n\nTo achieve the goal of the curriculum, then, you CANNOT listen to the\nego. Its purpose is to DEFEAT ITS OWN GOAL. It does not know this, because it\ndoes not know anything. But YOU can know this, and you WILL know it if you are\nwilling to look at what the ego has made of YOU. This IS your responsibility, because once you have really done this you WILL\naccept the Atonement for yourself. What other choice could you make?\n\nHaving made this choice, you will begin to learn and understand why\nyou have believed that when you met someone else, you have thought he WAS\nsomeone else. And every holy encounter in which YOU enter fully will teach you\nTHAT THIS IS NOT SO. You can encounter ONLY part of yourself, because you are\npart of God WHO IS EVERYTHING. His power and glory are everywhere, and you CANNOT\nbe excluded from them. The ego teaches that your strength is in you ALONE. The\nHoly Spirit teaches that ALL strength is in God and THEREFORE in you.\n\nGod wills NO-ONE suffer. He does not will ANYONE to suffer for a wrong\ndecision you have made, including YOURSELF. That is why He has given you the\nmeans for UNDOING it. Through His power and glory all your wrong decisions are\nundone COMPLETELY, releasing you AND your brothers from EVERY IMPRISONING THOUGHT\nANY part of the Sonship has accepted. Wrong decisions HAVE no power BECAUSE they\nare not true. The imprisonment which they SEEM to produce is no more true than\nTHEY are.\n\nPower and glory belong to God alone. So do YOU. God gives WHATEVER\nbelongs to Him, because He gives OF HIMSELF, and EVERYTHING belongs to Him.\nGiving of YOUR self is the function He gave you. Fulfilling it perfectly will\nteach you what YOU have of HIM. And this will teach you what you are IN Him. You\nCANNOT be powerLESS to do this, because this IS your power.

His peace IS\ncomplete, and you MUST be included in it. His laws govern you because they govern\nEVERYTHING. You cannot exempt yourself from His laws, although you CAN disobey\nthem. But if you do, and ONLY if you do, you WILL feel lonely and helpless,\nbecause you ARE denying yourself everything.\n\nI am come as a light into the world which DOES deny itself\neverything. It does this simply by dissociating itself FROM everything. It is\ntherefore an illusion of isolation, MAINTAINED by fear of the same loneliness\nwhich IS its illusion.

Light does not ATTACK darkness,\nbut it DOES shine it away. If my light goes with you everywhere, YOU shine it\naway WITH ME. The light becomes OURS, and you CANNOT abide in darkness, any more\nthan darkness can abide anywhere you go. The remembrance of me IS the remembrance\nof yourself and of Him Who sent me to you.\n\nYou WERE in darkness until God's Will was done completely by ANY part\nof the Sonship. When it was, it was perfectly accomplished by ALL. How else could\nit BE perfectly accomplished? My mission was simply to UNITE the Will of the\nSonship WITH the Will of the Father by being aware of the Father's Will myself.\nThis is the awareness I came to give YOU, and YOUR problem in accepting it IS the\nproblem of this world. Dispelling it is salvation, and in this sense I AM the\nsalvation of the world.\n\nThe world MUST despise and reject me, because the world IS the belief\nthat love is impossible. YOUR reactions to me ARE the reactions of the world to\nGod. If you will accept the fact that I am with you, you are DENYING the world\nand ACCEPTING GOD. My will IS His, and YOUR will to hear me IS the decision to\nhear His Voice and abide in His Will. As He sent me to you, so will I send you to\nothers. But I will go to them WITH you, so we can teach them union and peace.\n\nDo you not think the world needs peace as much as you do? Do you not\nwant to give it to the world as much as you want to receive it? For unless you\ndo, you will NOT receive it. If you will to have it of me, you MUST give it.\nRehabilitation does not come from anyone ELSE. You can have GUIDANCE from\nwithout, but you must ACCEPT it from within. The guidance must become what YOU\nwant, or else it will be meaningless to you. That is why rehabilitation is a\ncollaborative venture. I can tell you what to DO, but this will not really help\nyou unless you collaborate by believing that I KNOW what to do. Only then will\nyour MIND will to follow me.\n\nWithout YOUR will, you cannot be rehabilitated. MOTIVATION TO BE\nHEALED is the crucial factor in rehabilitation. Without this, you are deciding\nAGAINST healing, and your veto of my will FOR you MAKES HEALING IMPOSSIBLE. If\nhealing IS our joint will, unless our wills ARE joined you CANNOT be healed. This\nis obvious when you consider what healing is FOR.\n\nHealing is the way in which the separation is overcome. Separation is\novercome by UNION. It CANNOT be overcome by separating. The WILL to unite must be\nunequivocal, or the will ITSELF is separated or NOT WHOLE. Your will is the means\nby which you determine your own condition, because will is the MECHANISM OF\nDECISION. It is the power by which you separate or join, and experience pain or\njoy accordingly. My will cannot OVERCOME yours, because YOURS IS AS POWERFUL AS\nMINE. If it were not so, the Sons\nof God would be unequal.\n\nAll things BECOME possible through our JOINT will. But my will alone\nwill not help you. Your will is as free as mine, and God Himself would not go\nagainst it. I cannot will what God does NOT will. I CAN offer you my will to make\nYOURS invincible by this sharing, but I CANNOT oppose yours without competing\nwith it and thereby violating God's Will for you. Nothing God created can oppose\nyour will, as nothing God created can oppose His. God GAVE your will its power,\nwhich I can only acknowledge in honor of HIS.\n\nIf you want to be LIKE me, I will help you, knowing that we ARE alike.\nIf you want to be DIFFERENT, I will wait until you change your mind. I can TEACH\nyou, but only you can choose to LISTEN to my teaching. How else can it be, if\nGod's Kingdom IS freedom? Freedom cannot be learned by tyranny of ANY kind, and\nthe perfect equality of ALL God's Sons cannot be recognized through the dominion\nof one will over another. God's Sons are equal in will, all being the Will of\ntheir Father. This is the ONLY lesson I can teach, knowing that it is true.\n\nWhen your will is NOT mine, it is not Our Father's. This means that\nyou have imprisoned YOURS, and have not LET it be free. Of yourselves you can do\nnothing, because of yourselves you ARE nothing. I am nothing without the Father,\nand YOU are nothing without me because by DENYING the Father you deny YOURSELF. I\nwill ALWAYS remember you, and in MY remembrance OF you lies your remembrance of\nYOURSELF. In our remembrance of EACH OTHER lies our remembrance of God. And in\nthis remembrance lies your freedom, because your freedom is in Him.\n\nJoin then with me in praise of Him AND you whom He created. This is\nour gift of gratitude to Him, which He will share with ALL His Creations, to whom\nHe gives equally whatever is acceptable to Him. BECAUSE it is acceptable to Him,\nit is the gift of freedom, which IS His Will for all His Sons. By OFFERING\nfreedom you will be free, because\nfreedom is the only gift which you can offer to God's Sons, being an\nacknowledgment of what they are and what HE is.\n\nFreedom is creation because it is love. What you seek to imprison you\ndo NOT love. Therefore, when you seek to imprison ANYONE, including YOURSELF, you\ndo not love him and you cannot identify with him. When you imprison yourself, you\nare losing sight of your true identification with me and with the Father. Your\nidentification IS with the Father and with the Son. It CANNOT be with one and not\nthe other. If you are part of one, you MUST be part of the other because they ARE\nOne.\n\nThe Holy Trinity is holy BECAUSE It is One. If you exclude YOURSELF\nfrom this union, you are perceiving the Holy Trinity as separated. You MUST be\nincluded in It, because It IS everything. Unless you take your place in It and\nfulfill your function AS part of It, It is as bereft as YOU are. No part of It\ncan be imprisoned if Its Truth is to be known.\n\nCan you be separated from your identification and be at peace?\nDissociation is NOT a solution; it is a DELUSION. The delusional believe that\ntruth will ASSAIL them, and so they DO NOT SEE IT because they prefer the\ndelusion. Judging truth as something they do NOT want, they perceive deception\nand block knowledge. Help them by offering them YOUR unified will on their\nbehalf, as I am offering you mine on YOURS. Alone we can do nothing, but TOGETHER\nour wills fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its separate\nparts.\n\nBy NOT BEING SEPARATE, the Will of God is established IN ours and AS\nours. This will is invincible BECAUSE it is undivided. The UNDIVIDED will of the\nSonship is the perfect creator, being wholly in the likeness of God, Whose Will\nit IS. YOU cannot be exempt from it, if you are to understand what it is and what\nYOU are. By separating your will from mine, you ARE exempting yourself from the\nWill of God which IS yourself.\n\nBut to heal is still to make whole. Therefore to heal is to UNITE with\nthose who are LIKE you, because perceiving this likeness IS to\nrecognize the Father. If YOUR perfection is in Him and ONLY in Him, how can you\nKNOW it WITHOUT recognizing Him? The recognition of God is the recognition of\nyourself. There IS no separation of God and His Creation. You will learn this as\nyou learn that there is no separation of YOUR will and mine.\n\nLet the love of God shine upon you by your acceptance of me. MY\nreality is yours and His. By joining YOUR will with mine, you are signifying your\nawareness that the Will of God is One. His Oneness and ours are not separate,\nbecause His Oneness ENCOMPASSES ours. To join WITH me is to restore His power TO\nyou BECAUSE we are sharing it. I offer you only the recognition of His power in\nyou, but in that lies ALL truth. As WE unite, we unite with Him. Glory be to the\nunion of God and His Holy Sons, because all glory lies IN them because they ARE\nunited.\n\nThe miracles WE do bear witness to the Will of the Father for His Son,\nand to our joy in uniting WITH His Will FOR us. When you unite with me, you are\nuniting WITHOUT the ego, because I have renounced the ego in myself, and\ntherefore CANNOT unite with yours. OUR union is therefore the way to renounce the\nego in YOURSELVES. The truth in both of us is BEYOND the ego. By willing that,\nyou HAVE gone beyond it toward truth.\n\nOur success in transcending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I can\nshare my perfect confidence IN His Promise because I know He gave me this\nconfidence for both of us and ALL of us. I bring His Peace back to all His\nChildren, because I received it of Him for us all. Nothing can prevail against\nour united wills, because nothing can prevail against God's. Would ye know the\nWill of God for YOU? Ask it of me, who knows it for you, and you will find it.\nI will deny YOU nothing, as God denies ME nothing.\n\nOurs is simply the journey back to God Who is our home. Whenever fear\nintrudes anywhere along the road to peace, it is ALWAYS because the ego has\nattempted to JOIN the journey with us AND CANNOT DO SO. Sensing defeat and\nangered by it, it regards itself as rejected and becomes retaliative. You are invulnerable to its retaliation BECAUSE I AM WITH YOU. On\nthis journey, you have chosen me as your companion INSTEAD of your ego. Do not\ntry to hold on to both, or you will try to go in different directions and will\nlose the way.\n\nThe ego's way is not mine, but it is also NOT YOURS. The Holy Spirit\nhas one direction for ALL minds, and the one He taught me IS yours. Let us not\nlose sight of His direction through illusions, for ONLY illusions of another\ndirection can obscure the one for which God's Voice speaks in all of us. Never\naccord the ego the power to interfere with the journey, because it HAS none, and\nthe journey is the way to what is TRUE. Leave ALL deception behind, and reach\nbeyond all attempts of the ego to hold you back.\n\nI DO go before you, because I AM beyond the ego. Reach therefore for\nmy hand because you WANT to transcend the ego. My will, will NEVER be wanting,\nand if you want to share it YOU WILL. I give it willingly and gladly, because I\nneed YOU as much as you need ME.",

    "content": "The Power of Joint Decision\n\nWE are the joint will of the Sonship, whose wholeness is for all. We\nbegin the journey back by setting out TOGETHER, and gather in our brothers as we\nCONTINUE together.\n\nEvery gain in our strength is offered to all, so they, too, can lay\naside their weakness and add their strength to us. God's welcome waits for us\nall, and He will welcome us as I am welcoming YOU. Forget not the Kingdom of God\nfor anything the world has to offer. The world can ADD nothing to the power and\nthe glory of God and His Holy Sons, but it CAN blind the Sons to the Father if\nthey behold it. You cannot behold the world and know God. Only one is true.\n\nI am come to tell you that the choice of which is true is not yours.\nIf it were, you would have destroyed yourselves. But God did not will the\ndestruction of His Creations, having created them for eternity. His Will has\nsaved you, not from yourselves, but from your illusions of yourselves. He has\nsaved you FOR yourselves. Let us glorify Him Whom the world denies, for over His\nKingdom it has no power.\n\nNo-one created by God can find joy in anything except the eternal.\nThat is not because he is DEPRIVED of anything else, but because nothing else is\nWORTHY of him. What God AND His Sons create IS eternal, and in this and this only\nis their joy. Listen to the story of the prodigal son, and learn what God's\ntreasure is and YOURS:\n\nThis son of a loving father left his home and thought he squandered\neverything for nothing of any value, though he did not know its worthlessness at\nthe time. He was ashamed to return to his father, because he thought he had hurt\nhim. But when he came home the father welcomed him with joy, because only the son\nhimself WAS his father's treasure. HE WANTED NOTHING ELSE.\n\nGod wants only His Son, because His Son is His only treasure. You want\nyour creations, as He wants His. Your creations are your gift to the Holy\nTrinity, created in gratitude for YOUR creation. They do not leave you, any more\nthan you have left YOUR Creator. But they EXTEND your creation, as God extended\nHimself to YOU. Can the Creations of God Himself take joy in what is not real?\nAnd what IS real except the Creations of God and those which are created like\nHis? YOUR creations love you as your Soul loves your Father FOR THE GIFT OF\nCREATION. There IS no other gift that is eternal, and therefore THERE IS NO OTHER\nGIFT THAT IS TRUE.\n\nHow, then, can you accept anything else, or GIVE anything else, and\nexpect joy in return? And what else BUT joy would you want? You made neither\nyourself nor your function. YOU have made only the DECISION to be unworthy of\nboth. But you COULD not make YOURSELF unworthy because YOU ARE THE TREASURE OF\nGOD. What HE values IS valuable. There CAN be no question of its worth, because\nits value lies in God's sharing Himself with it and ESTABLISHING ITS\nVALUE FOREVER. YOUR function is to ADD to God's treasure by creating YOURS. His\nwill TO you is His Will FOR you. He would not withhold creation from you, because\nHIS joy is in it.\n\nYou CANNOT find joy EXCEPT as He does. HIS joy lay in creating YOU,\nand He extends His Fatherhood to you so that you can extend yourself AS HE DID.\nYou do not understand this because you do not understand Him. No one who does not\nknow his function can understand it. And no one CAN know his function unless he\nknows who he IS. Creation is the Will of God. His Will created you TO CREATE.\nYour will was not created separate from His, and so it wills as HE wills.\n\nAn unwilling will does not mean anything, because it is a\ncontradiction in terms which actually leaves nothing. You can make yourself\npowerless only in a way that has NO MEANING AT ALL. When you THINK you are\nunwilling to will with God, YOU ARE NOT THINKING. God's will IS thought. It\ncannot be contradicted BY thought. God does not contradict HIMSELF. And His Sons,\nwho are like Him, cannot contradict themselves OR Him. But their thought is so\npowerful that they can even imprison the mind of God's Son IF THEY SO CHOOSE.\nThis choice DOES make the Son's function unknown TO HIM, but never to his\nCreator. And BECAUSE it is not unknown to his Creator, it is forever knowable to\nhim.\n\nT 8 F 10. There is no question but one you should ever ask of yourself: “Do I\nwant to know my Father's Will for me?” HE will not hide it. He has revealed it to\nme because I asked it of Him, and learned of what He had already given. Our\nfunction is to function together, because apart from each other we cannot\nfunction at all. The whole power of God's Son lies in all of us, but not in any\nof us alone.\nGod would not have us be alone because HE does not will to be alone. That is why\nHe created His Son and gave him the power to create with Him. Our creations are\nas holy as we are, and we are the Sons of God Himself, and therefore as holy as\nHe is. Through our creations we extend our Love, and thus increase the joy of the\nHoly Trinity. You do not understand this for a very simple reason. You who are\nGod's own treasure do not regard yourselves as valuable. Given this belief YOU\nCANNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING.\n\nI share with God the knowledge of the value HE puts upon you. My\ndevotion to you is of Him, being born of my knowledge of myself AND Him. We\ncannot BE separated. Whom God has joined CANNOT be separated, and God has\njoined all His Sons WITH HIMSELF. Can you be separated from your life and your\nbeing? The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you\nare always, and what you are forever. It is a journey without distance, to a goal\nthat has never changed.\n\nTruth can only be EXPERIENCED. It cannot be described and it cannot be\nexplained. I can make you aware of the CONDITIONS of truth, but the experience is\nof God. Together we can meet its conditions, but truth will dawn upon you of\nitself. What God has willed for you IS yours. He has given His Will to His\ntreasure, whose treasure It is. Your heart lies where your treasure is, as His\ndoes. You who are beloved of God are wholly blessed. Learn this of me, and free\nthe Holy Will of all those who are as blessed as you are.",

    "content": "Communication and the Ego-Body Equation\n\nAttack is ALWAYS physical. When attack in ANY form enters your mind,\nyou are EQUATING YOURSELF WITH A BODY. This is the ego's INTERPRETATION of the\nbody. You do not have to ATTACK physically to accept this interpretation; you ARE\naccepting it simply by the belief that attack can GET YOU SOMETHING YOU WANT. If\nyou did NOT believe this, the IDEA of attack would have no appeal to you.\n\nWhen you equate yourself with a body, you will ALWAYS experience\ndepression. When a Child of God thinks of himself in this way, he is belittling\nhimself and seeing his brothers as similarly belittled. Since he can find himself\nONLY in them, he has cut himself off from salvation. Remember that the Holy\nSpirit interprets the body ONLY as a means of communication. Being the\ncommunication link between God and His separated Sons, He interprets everything\nYOU have in the light of what HE is.\n\nThe ego SEPARATES through the body. The Holy Spirit reaches THROUGH it\nto others. You do not perceive your brothers as the Holy Spirit does because you\ndo not interpret their bodies AND YOURS solely as a means of JOINING THEIR MINDS\nand uniting them with yours and mine. This interpretation of the body will change\nyour mind entirely about its value. Of itself it has NONE. If you use it for\nattack it is harmful to you. But if you use it ONLY to reach the minds of those\nwho believe they ARE bodies and teach them THROUGH the body that THIS IS NOT SO,\nyou will begin to understand the power of the mind that is in both of you. If you\nuse the body for this, and ONLY for this, you CANNOT use it for attack. In the\nservice of uniting, it becomes a beautiful lesson in communion, which has value\nuntil communion IS.\n\nThis is God's way of making unlimited what YOU have limited. His Voice\ndoes not see the body as YOU do, because He knows the ONLY reality that ANYTHING\ncan have is the service it can render God on behalf of the function HE has given.\nCommunication ENDS separation. Attack PROMOTES it. The body is ugly or beautiful,\nsavage or holy, helpful or harmful, according to the use to which it is put. And\nin the body of another you will see the use to which you put YOURS.\n\nIf the body becomes for you a means which you give to the Holy Spirit\nto use on behalf of the union of the Sonship, you will not see ANYTHING physical\nexcept as WHAT IT IS. Use it for truth, and you will see it truly. MISuse it and\nyou WILL misunderstand it, because you have already done so BY misusing it.\nInterpret ANYTHING apart from the Holy Spirit, and you will mistrust it. This\nwill lead you to hatred and attack and LOSS OF PEACE.\n\nBut ALL loss comes only from your own misunderstanding. Loss of ANY\nkind is impossible. When you look upon a brother as a physical entity, HIS power\nand glory are lost to you and SO ARE YOURS. You HAVE attacked him, and you MUST\nhave attacked yourself first. Do not see him this way for your OWN salvation,\nwhich MUST bring him his. Do not ALLOW him to belittle himself in YOUR mind, but\ngive him freedom from his belief in littleness, and escape from YOURS. As part of\nYOU, HE is holy. As part of ME, YOU are. To communicate with part of God Himself\nis to reach beyond the Kingdom to its Creator, through His Voice which He has\nestablished as part of YOU.\n\nRejoice, then, that of yourselves you can do nothing. You are not OF\nyourselves. And He of Whom you ARE has willed your power and glory FOR you, with\nwhich you can perfectly accomplish His holy Will for you when you so will it\nyourself. He has not withdrawn His gifts from YOU, but YOU have withdrawn them\nfrom Him. Let no Son of God remain hidden for His Name's sake, because His Name\nis YOURS.\n\nRemember that the Bible says, “The word (or thought) was made\nflesh.” Strictly speaking, this is impossible, since it seems to involve the\ntranslation of one order of reality into another. Different orders of reality\nmerely SEEM to exist, just as different orders of miracles do. Thought cannot be\nMADE into flesh except by belief, because thought is NOT physical. But thought IS\ncommunication, for which the body can be used. This is the only NATURAL use to\nwhich it can be put. To use the body UNnaturally is to lose sight of the Holy\nSpirit's purpose, and thus to confuse the goal of His curriculum.\n\nThere is nothing so frustrating to a learner as to place him in a\ncurriculum which he cannot learn. His sense of adequacy suffers, and he MUST\nbecome depressed. Being faced with an impossible learning situation, REGARDLESS\nof why it is impossible, is the most depressing thing in the world. In fact, it\nis ultimately WHY the world is depressing. The Holy Spirit's curriculum is NEVER\ndepressing because it is a curriculum in joy. Whenever the reaction to learning\nis depression, it is only because the goal of the curriculum has been lost sight\nof.\n\nIn the world, not even the body is perceived as whole. Its purpose is\nseen as fragmented into many functions which bear little or no relationship to\neach other, so that it appears to be ruled by chaos. Guided by the ego, it IS. Guided by the Holy Spirit, it is NOT. It becomes ONLY a\nmeans by which the part of the mind which you have separated from your Soul can\nreach beyond its distortions and RETURN to the Soul. The ego's temple thus\nbecomes the temple of the Holy Spirit, where devotion to Him replaces devotion to\nthe ego. In this sense the body DOES become a temple to God, because His Voice\nabides in it by directing the use TO WHICH YOU PUT IT.\n\nHealing is the result of using the body SOLELY for communication.\nSince this IS natural, it heals by making whole, which is also natural. ALL mind\nis whole, and the belief that part of it is physical or NOT MIND is a fragmented\n(or sick) interpretation. Mind CANNOT be made physical, but it CAN be made\nmanifest THROUGH the physical if it uses the body to GO BEYOND itself. By\nreaching OUT, the mind EXTENDS itself. It does not STOP at the body, for if it\ndoes it is blocked in its purpose. A mind which has been blocked has allowed\nitself to be vulnerable to attack, because it has TURNED AGAINST ITSELF.\n\nThe removal of blocks, then, is the ONLY way to guarantee help and\nhealing. Help and healing are the normal expressions of a mind which is working\nTHROUGH the body but not IN it. If the mind believes the body is its GOAL, it\nWILL distort its perception OF the body, and by blocking its own extension BEYOND\nit will INDUCE illness by FOSTERING SEPARATION. Perceiving the body AS A SEPARATE\nENTITY cannot BUT foster illness, because it is not true. A medium of\ncommunication WILL lose its usefullness if it is used for anything else.\n\nTo use a medium of communication as a medium of ATTACK is an obvious\nconfusion in purpose. To communicate is to join and to attack is to separate. How\ncan you do both simultaneously WITH THE SAME THING, and NOT suffer? Perception of\nthe body can be unified only by ONE PURPOSE. This releases the mind from the\ntemptation to see it in many lights, and gives it over ENTIRELY to the One Light\nin which it can be really understood at all.\n\nTo confuse a learning device with a curriculum GOAL is a fundamental\nconfusion. Learning can hardly be meaningfully arrested at its own aids, and hope\nto understand them OR its real purpose. Learning must lead BEYOND the body to the\nre-establishment of the power of the mind IN it. This can be accomplished ONLY if\nthe mind EXTENDS to other minds, and does not ARREST ITSELF in its extension. The\narrest of the mind's extension is the cause of all illness, because ONLY\nEXTENSION IS THE MIND'S FUNCTION. Block this, and you have blocked health because\nyou have BLOCKED THE MIND'S JOY.\n\nThe opposite of joy is depression. When your learning promotes\ndepression INSTEAD of joy, you CANNOT be listening to God's joyous teacher, and\nyou MUST be learning amiss. To see a body as anything EXCEPT a means of pure\nextension is to limit your mind and HURT YOURSELF. Health is therefore nothing\nmore than united purpose. If the body is brought under the purpose of the mind,\nit becomes whole because the mind's purpose IS one.\n\nAttack can only be an assumed goal of the body, but the body APART\nfrom the mind HAS NO PURPOSE AT ALL. You are NOT limited by the body, and thought\nCANNOT be made flesh. But mind can be manifested through the body if it goes\nbeyond it and DOES NOT INTERPRET IT AS LIMITATION. Whenever you see another as\nlimited TO or BY the body, you are imposing this limit ON YOURSELF. Are you\nwilling to ACCEPT this, when your whole purpose for learning should be to escape\nFROM limitations?\n\nTo conceive of the body as a means of attack of any kind, and to\nentertain even the possibility that joy could POSSIBLY result, is a clear-cut\nindication of a poor learner. He has accepted a learning goal in obvious\ncontradiction to the unified purpose of the curriculum, and is interfering with\nhis ability to accept it AS HIS OWN.\n\nJoy is unified purpose, and unified purpose is ONLY God's. When yours\nis unified, it IS His. Interfere with His purpose, and YOU NEED SALVATION. You\nhave condemned yourself, but condemnation is not of God. Therefore, it is not\ntrue. No more are any of the RESULTS of your condemnation. When you see a brother\nas a body, you are condemning him BECAUSE you have condemned yourself. But if ALL\ncondemnation is unreal, and it MUST be unreal because it is a form of attack,\nthen it can HAVE no results.\n\nDo not allow yourselves to suffer from the results of what is not\ntrue. Free your minds from the belief that this is possible. In its complete\nimpossibility, and your full awareness OF its complete impossibility, lies your\nonly hope for release. But what other hope would you want? Freedom from illusions\nlies only in not BELIEVING them. THERE IS NO ATTACK, but there IS unlimited\ncommunication and therefore unlimited power and wholeness. The power of wholeness\nis EXTENSION. Do not arrest your thought in this world, and you will open your\nmind to Creation in God.",

    "content": "The Body as Means or End\n\nAttitudes toward the body are attitudes toward ATTACK. The ego's\ndefinitions of ANYTHING are childish, and are ALWAYS based on what it believes a\nthing is FOR. This is because it is incapable of true generalizations, and\nequates what it sees with the function IT ascribes to it. It does NOT equate it\nwith what it IS. To the ego, the body IS TO ATTACK WITH. Equating YOU with the\nbody, it teaches that YOU are to attack with, because THIS IS WHAT IT BELIEVES.\nThe body, then, is not the source of its own health. Its condition lies solely in\nyour interpretation of its function.\n\nThe reason why definitions by function are inferior is merely because\nthey may well be inaccurate. Functions are part of being, since they arise FROM\nit. But the relationship is NOT reciprocal. The whole does define the part, but\nthe part does NOT define the whole. This is as true of knowledge as it is of\nperception. The reason why to KNOW in part is to know entirely is merely because\nof the fundamental difference between knowledge and perception. In perception,\nthe whole is built up of parts, which can separate and reassemble in different\nconstellations. Knowledge never changes, so that its constellation is permanent.\nThe only areas in which part-whole relationships have any meaning are those in\nwhich change is possible. There IS no difference between the whole and the part\nwhere change is impossible.\n\nThe body exists in a world which seems to contain two voices which are\nfighting for its possession. In this perceived constellation, the body is\nregarded as capable of shifting its control from one to the other, making the\nconcept of both health and sickness possible. The ego makes a fundamental\nconfusion between means and ends, as it always does. Regarding the body as an\nend, it has no real use for it at all, because it is NOT an end. You must have\nnoticed an outstanding characteristic of every end that the ego has accepted as\nits own. When you have achieved it, IT HAS NOT SATISFIED YOU. This is why the ego\nis forced to shift from one end to another without ceasing, so that YOU will\ncontinue to hope it can offer you something.\n\nIt has been particularly difficult to overcome the ego's belief in the\nbody as an end because this is synonymous with ATTACK AS AN END. The ego has a\nREAL INVESTMENT IN SICKNESS. If you are sick, how can you object to the ego's\nfirm belief that you are NOT invulnerable? This is a particularly appealing\nargument from the ego's point of view, because it obscures the obvious attack\nwhich underlies the sickness. If you accepted THIS, and also decided AGAINST\nattack, you could not give this false witness to the ego's stand. It is hard to\nperceive this as a false witness, because you do not realize that it IS entirely\nout of keeping with what YOU want. This witness, then, appears to be innocent and\ntrustworthy only because YOU have not seriously cross-examined him.\n\nIf you did, you would not consider sickness such a strong witness on\nbehalf of the ego's views. A more honest statement would be as follows: Those who\nWANT the ego are predisposed to defend it. Therefore, their choice of witnesses\nshould be suspect from the beginning. The ego does not call upon witnesses who\nmight disagree with its case, NOR DOES THE HOLY SPIRIT. We have said before that\njudgment IS the function of the Holy Spirit, and one which He is perfectly\nequipped to fulfill. The ego, as a judge, gives anything BUT an impartial trial\n(judgment.) When the ego calls on a witness, it has ALREADY MADE IT AN ALLY. It\nis still true that the body has no function of itself. This is because it is NOT\nan end. The ego, however, establishes it AS an end because, as such, IT WILL LOSE\nITS TRUE FUNCTION.\n\nThis is the purpose of everything the ego does. Its sole aim is to\nlose sight of the functions of EVERYTHING. A sick body does not make any sense.\nIt COULD not make any sense, since sickness is not what it is FOR. Sickness is\nmeaningful only if the two basic premises on which the ego's interpretation of\nthe body rests are true. These are specifically first that the body is for\nattack, and also that you ARE a body. Without this, sickness is completely\ninconceivable. Sickness is a way of demonstrating that YOU CAN BE HURT. It is a\nwitness to your frailty, your vulnerability, and your extreme need to depend on\nexternal guidance. The ego uses this as its best argument for your need for ITS\nguidance. It dictates endless prescriptions for AVOIDING this catastrophic\noutcome. The Holy Spirit, perfectly aware of the same data, does not bother to analyze it at all. If the data are meaningless, there is no point in treating\nthem at all.\n\nThe function of truth is to collect data which are TRUE. There is no\npoint in trying to make sense out of meaningless data. ANY way they are handled\nresults in nothing. The more complicated the results become, the harder it may be\nto recognize their nothingness, but it is not necessary to examine ALL possible\noutcomes to which premises give rise to judge the PREMISES truly.\n\nA learning DEVICE is NOT a teacher. IT cannot tell you how you feel.\nYOU do not KNOW how you feel, because YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE EGO'S CONFUSION,\nand YOU think A LEARNING DEVICE CAN TELL YOU HOW YOU FEEL. Sickness is merely\nanother example of your insistence on asking for guidance of a teacher who DOES\nNOT KNOW THE ANSWER. The ego is INCAPABLE of knowing how you feel. When we said\nthat the ego DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING, we said the one thing about the ego that is\nwholly true. But there is a corollary. If knowledge is being, and the ego has no\nknowledge, then the ego HAS NO BEING.\n\nYou might ask how the voice of something which does not exist can be\nso insistent. Have you ever seriously considered the distorting power of\nsomething you WANT, even if it is not true? You have had many instances of how\nwhat you want can distort what you see and hear. No one can doubt the ego's skill\nin building up false cases. And no one can doubt your willingness to listen,\nuntil YOU will not to tolerate ANYTHING except truth.\n\nWhen YOU lay the ego aside it will be gone. The Holy Spirit's voice is\nas loud as your willingness to listen. It cannot be louder without violating your\nwill, which He seeks to free but never to command. He will teach you to use your body ONLY to reach your brothers so He can teach\nHis message through you. This will heal them and THEREFORE heal you. Everything\nused in accordance with its function as HE sees it CANNOT be sick. Everything\nused otherwise IS.\n\nDo not allow the body to be a mirror of a split mind. Do not let it be\nan image of your own perception of littleness. Do not let it reflect your will to\nattack. Health is the natural state of anything whose interpretation is left to\nthe Holy Spirit, who perceives no attack on anything. Health is the result of\nrelinquishing ALL attempts to use the body lovelessly. It is the beginning of the\nproper perspective on life, under the guidance of the one teacher who knows what\nlife IS, being the voice for Life Itself.",

    "content": "Healing as Corrected Perception\n\nWe once said that the Holy Spirit is the Answer. He is the answer to\nEVERYTHING, because He knows what the answer to everything IS. The ego does not\nknow what a REAL question is, although it asks an endless number. But YOU can\nlearn this, as you learn to question the value of the ego and thus establish your\nability to EVALUATE its questions. When the ego tempts you to sickness, do not\nask the Holy Spirit to heal the body. For this would merely be to accept the\nego's belief that the body is the proper aim for healing. Ask rather that the\nHoly Spirit teach you the right PERCEPTION of the body, for perception alone can\nbe distorted.\n\nONLY PERCEPTION CAN BE SICK, because perception can be WRONG. Wrong\nperception is DISTORTED WILLING, which WANTS things to be as they are not. The\nreality of EVERYTHING is totally harmless, because total harmlessness is the\nCONDITION of its reality. It is also the condition of your AWARENESS of its\nreality. You do not have to SEEK reality. It will seek you and FIND you, WHEN YOU\nMEET ITS CONDITIONS. Its conditions are part of WHAT IT IS. And this part only is\nup to you. The rest is of Itself. You need\ndo so little, because It is so powerful that your little part WILL bring the\nwhole to you. Accept, then, your little part, and LET the whole be yours.\nWholeness heals BECAUSE it is of the mind.\n\nAll forms of sickness, even unto death, are physical expressions of\nthe FEAR OF AWAKENING. They are attempts to reinforce UNCONSCIOUSNESS out of fear\nof CONSCIOUSNESS. This is a pathetic way of TRYING NOT TO KNOW by rendering the\nfaculties for knowing ineffectual. “Rest in peace” is a blessing for the living,\nnot the dead, because rest comes from waking, not from sleeping. Sleep is\nwithdrawing; waking is JOINING. Dreams are ILLUSIONS of joining, taking on the\nego's distortions about what joining means, if you are sleeping under its\nguidance. But the Holy Spirit, too, has use for sleep, and can use dreams on\nBEHALF of waking, if you will let Him.\n\nHow you wake is the sign of how you have used sleep. To whom did you\ngive it? Under which teacher did you place it? Whenever you wake dis-spiritedly,\nit was NOT of the Spirit. ONLY when you awaken joyously have you utilized sleep\nACCORDING TO THE HOLY SPIRIT'S PURPOSE. You can indeed be “drugged by sleep,” but\nthis is ALWAYS because you have MISUSED IT ON BEHALF OF SICKNESS. Sleep is no\nmore a form of death than death is a form of unconsciousness. UNCONSCIOUSNESS IS\nIMPOSSIBLE. You can rest in peace only BECAUSE YOU ARE AWAKE.\n\nHealing is release from the fear of waking, and the substitution of\nthe will to wake. The will to wake is the will to love, since ALL healing\ninvolves replacing fear with love. The Holy Spirit cannot distinguish among\ndegrees of error, for if He taught that one form of sickness is more serious than\nanother, He would be teaching that one error can be more REAL than another. But\nHIS function is to distinguish ONLY between the false and the true, REPLACING the\nfalse WITH the true.\n\nThe ego, which always WEAKENS the will, wants to SEPARATE the body\nfrom the mind. This IS an attempt to DESTROY it. But the ego actually believes\nthat it is PROTECTING it. This is because it believes that MIND IS DANGEROUS, and\nthat to MAKE MINDLESS is to heal. But to make mindless is impossible, since it\nwould mean to make nothing out of what God Created. The ego DESPISES weakness,\neven though it makes every effort to INDUCE it. IT WANTS ONLY WHAT IT HATES. To\nthe ego this is perfectly sensible. Believing in the power of attack, it WANTS\nit.\n\nYou have begun to realize that this is a very practical course,\nbecause it means EXACTLY what it says. So does the Bible, if it is properly\nunderstood. There has been a marked tendency on the part of many of the Bible's\nfollowers, and also its translators, to be entirely literal about fear and ITS\neffects, but NOT about love and ITS results. Thus, “hellfire” means burning, but\nraising the dead becomes allegorical. Actually, it is PARTICULARLY the references\nto the outcomes of love that should be taken literally because the Bible is ABOUT\nlove, being about GOD.\n\nThe Bible enjoins you to be perfect, to heal ALL errors, to take no\nthought of the body AS SEPARATE, and to accomplish all things IN MY NAME. This is\nnot my name alone, for ours is a shared identification. The name of God's Son is\nOne, and you are enjoined to do the works of love BECAUSE we share this oneness.\nOur minds are whole BECAUSE they are one. If you are sick, you are withdrawing\nfrom me. But you CANNOT WITHDRAW FROM ME ALONE. You can only withdraw from\nyourself AND me.\n\nI would not ask you to do things which you CANNOT do, and it is\nimpossible that I could do things YOU cannot do. Given this, and given this QUITE\nLITERALLY, there CAN be nothing which prevents you from doing EXACTLY what I ask,\nand EVERYTHING which argues FOR it. I give you NO limits, because God lays none\nupon you. When you limit YOURSELF, we are NOT of one mind, and that IS sickness. But\nsickness is not of the body, but OF THE MIND. ALL forms of DISfunction are merely\nsigns that the mind has split, and does not accept a UNIFIED PURPOSE.\n\nThe unification of purpose, then, is the Holy Spirit's ONLY way of\nhealing. This is because it is the only level at which healing MEANS anything.\nThe re-establishing of meaning in a chaotic thought system IS the only way to\nheal it. We said before that your task is only to meet the conditions FOR\nmeaning, since meaning itself is of God. But your RETURN to meaning is essential\nTO HIS, because YOUR meaning is PART of His. Your healing, then, is part of HIS\nhealth, because it is part of His Wholeness. He cannot lose this, but YOU can not\nknow it. Yet it is still His will for you, and His will MUST stand forever and in\nall things.",

    "content": "The Acceptance of Reality\n\nFear of the Will of God is one of the strangest beliefs that the human\nmind has ever made. This could not possibly have occurred unless the mind was\nalready profoundly split, making it possible for IT to be afraid of what it\nreally is. It is apparent that reality CANNOT “threaten” anything except\nillusions, because reality can only UPHOLD truth. The very fact that the will of\nGod, which IS what you are, is perceived as fearful TO you demonstrates that you\nARE afraid of what you are. It is not, then, the will of God of which you are\nafraid, but YOURS. Your will is NOT the ego's, and that is why the ego is against\nyou. What seems to be the fear of God is really only the fear of YOUR OWN\nREALITY.\n\nIt is impossible to learn anything consistently in a state of panic.\nIf the purpose of this course is to learn what you are, and if you have ALREADY\nDECIDED that what you are is FEARFUL, then it MUST follow that you will NOT LEARN\nTHIS COURSE. But you might remember that the reason FOR the course is that you do\nNOT know who you are. If you do not know your reality, how would you know whether\nit is fearful or not? The association of truth and fear, which would be highly\nartificial at best, is particularly inappropriate in the minds of those who do\nnot know what truth IS. All that this kind of association means is that you are\narbitrarily endowing something quite beyond your awareness with something YOU DO\nNOT WANT.\n\nIt is evident, then, that you are judging something of which you are\ntotally unaware. You have set this strange situation up so that it is COMPLETELY\nIMPOSSIBLE to escape from it WITHOUT a guide who DOES know what your reality is.\nThe purpose of this Guide is merely to remind you of what YOU want. He is not\nattempting to force an alien will UPON you. He is merely making every possible\neffort, within the limits YOU impose upon Him, to RE-ESTABLISH your OWN will in\nyour consciousness. You have IMPRISONED it in your UNconscious, where it remains\navailable, but cannot help you. When we said that the Holy Spirit's function is\nto sort out the true from the false in your unconscious, we meant that He has the\npower to look into what YOU have\nhidden, and perceive the Will of God there.\n\nHis perception of this will can make it real to YOU, because HE is in\nyour mind, and therefore He IS your reality. If, then, His perception OF your\nmind brings its reality TO you, He IS teaching you what you are. The only source\nof fear in this whole process can ONLY be WHAT YOU THINK YOU LOSE. But it is only\nwhat the Holy Spirit sees that you can possibly HAVE. We have emphasized many\ntimes that the Holy Spirit will never call upon you to sacrifice anything. But if\nyou ask the sacrifice of reality OF YOURSELVES, the Holy Spirit MUST remind you\nthat this is not God's will BECAUSE it is not yours.\n\nThere is NO DIFFERENCE between your will and God's. If you did not\nhave divided wills, you would recognize that willing is salvation because it IS\ncommunication. It is impossible to communicate in alien tongues. You and your\nCreator can communicate through creation, because that, and only that, IS your\njoint will. Divided wills do not communicate because they speak for different\nthings TO THE SAME MIND. This loses the ability to communicate, simply because\nconfused communication DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING. A message cannot be said to be\ncommunicated UNLESS it makes sense.\n\nHow sensible can your messages be, when they ask for WHAT YOU DON'T\nWANT? Yet as long as you are afraid of your will, this is precisely what you WILL\nask for. You may insist that the Holy Spirit does not answer you, but it might be\nwiser to consider the kind of asker you are. YOU DO NOT ASK ONLY FOR WHAT YOU\nWANT. This is SOLELY because you are afraid you might receive it, AND YOU WOULD.\nTHIS is really why you persist in asking the teacher who could not possibly teach\nyou your will. Of him, you can never learn it, and this gives you the illusion of\nsafety. But you cannot be safe FROM truth, but only IN it. Reality is the ONLY\nsafety.\n\nYour will is your salvation BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME AS GOD'S. The\nseparation is nothing more than the belief that it is DIFFERENT. NO mind can\nbelieve that its will is STRONGER than God's. If, then, a mind believes that ITS\nwill is different FROM His, it can only decide either that there IS no God, or\nthat GOD'S WILL IS FEARFUL. The former accounts for the atheist, and the latter\nfor the martyr. Martyrdom takes many forms, the category including ALL\ndoctrines which hold that God demands sacrifices of ANY kind.\n\nEither basic type of insane decision will induce panic, because the\natheist believes he is alone and the martyr believes that God is crucifying him.\nBoth really fear both abandonment AND retaliation, but the former is more\nreactive against abandonment and the latter against retaliation. The atheist\nmaintains that God has left him, but he does not care. He will, however, become\nvery fearful, and hence very ANGRY, if anyone suggests that God has NOT left him.\nThe martyr, on the other hand, is more aware of guilt, and believing that\npunishment is inevitable, attempts to teach himself to LIKE it.\n\nThe truth is, very simply, that NO-ONE WANTS EITHER ABANDONMENT OR\nRETALIATION. Many people SEEK both, but it is still true that they do NOT want\nit. Can you ask the Holy Spirit for “gifts” such as these, and actually expect to\nRECEIVE them? The Holy Spirit is totally incapable of giving YOU anything that\ndoes NOT come from God. His task is NOT to make anything FOR you. He CANNOT make\nyou want something you DON'T want. When you ask the Universal Giver for what you\ndo not want, YOU are asking for what CANNOT be given, BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER\nCREATED. It was never created because it was never your will for YOU.\n\nUltimately everyone must learn the will of God, because ultimately\neveryone must recognize HIMSELF. This recognition IS the recognition that HIS\nWILL AND GOD'S ARE ONE. In the presence of Truth, there are no unbelievers and no\nsacrifices. In the security of Reality fear is totally meaningless. To deny what\nIS can only SEEM to be fearful. Fear cannot be real without a cause, and GOD is\nthe only Cause. God is Love, and you DO want Him. This IS your will. Ask for THIS\nand you WILL be answered, because you will be asking only for what BELONGS to\nyou.\n\nWhen you ask the Holy Spirit for what would hurt you, He CANNOT\nanswer, because NOTHING can hurt you and SO YOU ARE ASKING FOR NOTHING. ANY\ndesire which stems from the ego IS a desire for nothing, and to ask for it IS NOT\nA REQUEST. It is merely a denial in the FORM of a request. The Holy Spirit is not\nconcerned with form at all, being aware only of MEANING. The ego cannot ask the\nHoly Spirit for ANYTHING, because there is COMPLETE COMMUNICATION FAILURE between\nthem. But YOU can ask for EVERYTHING of the Holy Spirit, because YOUR requests\nare real, being of your will. Would the Holy Spirit deny the Will of God? And\ncould He fail to recognize it in God's Sons?\n\nThe energy which you withdraw from Creation you expend on fear. This\nis not because your ENERGY is limited, but because YOU HAVE LIMITED IT. You do\nnot recognize the ENORMOUS waste of energy which you expend in denying truth.\nWhat would YOU say of someone who PERSISTED in attempting the impossible, and\nbelieved that to ACHIEVE it is SUCCESS? The belief that you MUST HAVE THE\nIMPOSSIBLE in order to be happy is totally at variance with the principle of\nCreation. God COULD not will that happiness DEPENDED on what you could never\nhave.\n\nThe fact that God is love does not require belief, but it DOES require\nACCEPTANCE. It is indeed possible for you to DENY facts, although it is\nIMPOSSIBLE for you to CHANGE them. If you hold your hands over your eyes you will\nNOT see, because you are interfering with the laws of seeing. If you deny love\nyou will NOT KNOW IT because your cooperation is the LAW OF ITS BEING. You cannot\nchange laws you did not make, and the laws of happiness were created FOR you, NOT\nBY you.\n\nAttempts of any kind to deny what IS are fearful, and if they are\nstrong they WILL induce panic. WILLING AGAINST reality, though impossible, can be\nMADE into a very persistent goal, EVEN THOUGH YOU DO NOT WANT IT. But consider\nthe result of this strange decision.\nYou are DEVOTING your mind to what you DO NOT WANT. How real can this devotion\nbe? If you do not want it, it was never created. If it was never created, it is\nnothing. Can you REALLY devote yourself to nothing?\n\nGod, in His devotion to YOU, created you devoted to EVERYTHING, and\nGAVE you what you are devoted TO. Otherwise, you would not have been created\nperfect. Reality IS everything, and you therefore have everything BECAUSE you are\nreal. You cannot make the UNreal because the ABSENCE of reality is fearful, and\nfear cannot BE created. As long as you believe that fear is possible, YOU WILL\nNOT CREATE. Opposing orders of reality MAKE REALITY MEANINGLESS, and reality is\nMEANING.\n\nRemember, then, that God's Will is ALREADY possible, and nothing else\nwill EVER be. This is the simple acceptance of Reality because only this is real.\nYou cannot DISTORT reality and KNOW WHAT IT IS. And if you DO distort reality you\nwill experience anxiety, depression, and ultimately panic, because you are trying",

    "content": "The Answer to Prayer\n\nEveryone who has ever tried to use prayer to request something, has\nexperienced what appears to be failure. This is not only true in connection with\nspecific things which might be harmful, but also in connection with requests\nwhich are strictly in line with this course. The latter, in particular, might be\nincorrectly interpreted as “proof” that the course does not mean what it says.\nBut you must remember that the course does state, and REPEATEDLY, that its\npurpose is the ESCAPE FROM FEAR.\n\nLet us suppose, then, that what you request of the Holy Spirit IS what\nyou really want, but that YOU ARE STILL AFRAID OF IT. Should this be the case,\nyour ATTAINMENT of it would no longer BE what you want, even if IT is. This\naccounts for why CERTAIN SPECIFIC FORMS of healing are not achieved, even though\nthe STATE of healing IS. It frequently happens that an individual asks for\nphysical healing, because he is fearful OF BODILY HARM. However, at the same\ntime, if he WERE healed physically, the threat to his thought-system would be\nconsiderably MORE fearful to him than its physical EXPRESSION. In this case, he\nis not really asking for RELEASE from fear, but for the removal of a symptom\nWHICH HE HAS SELECTED. This request is, therefore, NOT for healing at all.\n\nThe Bible emphasizes that ALL prayers are answered, and this must be\ntrue, if no effort is wasted. The very fact that one has asked the Holy Spirit\nfor ANYTHING, will ensure a response. But it is equally certain that no response,\ngiven by the Holy Spirit, will EVER be one which would INCREASE fear. It is even\npossible that His answer will not be heard at all. It is IMpossible, however,\nthat it will be lost. There are many answers which you have already received, but\nhave NOT YET HEARD. I assure you that they are waiting for you. It is indeed true\nthat no effort is wasted.\n\nIf you would know your prayers are answered, never doubt a Son of God.\nDo not question him, and do not confound him, for your faith in him is your faith\nin YOURSELF. If you would know God and His Answer, believe in me, whose faith in\nYOU cannot be shaken. Can you ask of the Holy Spirit truly, and doubt your\nbrother? Believe his words are true, because of the truth which is in him. You\nwill unite with the truth in him, and his words will BE true. As you hear him,\nyou will hear me.\n\nLISTENING to truth is the only way you can hear it now, and finally\nKNOW it. The message your brother gives you is UP TO YOU. What does he say to\nyou? What would YOU have him say? Your decision ABOUT him determines the message\nYOU receive. Remember that the Holy Spirit is in him, and His Voice speaks to YOU\nthrough him. What can so holy a brother tell you EXCEPT truth? But are you\nLISTENING to it?\n\nYour brother may not know who he is, but there is a Light in his mind\nwhich DOES know. This Light can shine into yours, making HIS words true, and you\nABLE TO HEAR THEM. His words ARE the Holy Spirit's answer to YOU. Is your faith\nin him strong enough to LET you listen and hear? Salvation is of your brother.\nThe Holy Spirit extends from your mind to his, and answers YOU. You cannot hear\nthe Voice for God in yourself alone, because you are NOT alone. And His answer is\nonly for what you ARE.\n\nYou will not know the trust I have in you, unless you EXTEND it. You\nwill not trust the guidance of the Holy Spirit, or believe that it is for YOU,\nunless you hear it in others.\nIt MUST be for your brother, BECAUSE it is for you. Would God have created a\nVoice for you alone? Could you hear His answer EXCEPT as He answers ALL of God's\nSons? Hear of your brother what you would have me hear of YOU, for you would not\nwant ME to be deceived.\n\nI love you for the truth in you, as GOD does. Your deceptions may\ndeceive YOU, but they CANNOT deceive ME. Knowing what you ARE, I CANNOT doubt\nyou. I hear only the Holy Spirit in you, Who speaks to me through YOU. If you\nwould hear ME, hear my brothers, in whom God's Voice speaks. The answer to ALL\nyour prayers lies in them. You will be answered as you HEAR THE ANSWER IN\nEVERYONE. Do not listen to anything else, or you will not hear truth.\n\nBelieve in your brothers BECAUSE I believe in you, and you will learn\nthat my belief in you is justified. Believe in me BY believing in them, for the\nsake of what God gave them. THEY WILL ANSWER YOU, if you learn to ask truth of\nthem. Do not ask for blessings without blessing THEM, for only in this way can\nYOU learn how blessed YOU are. By following this way, you ARE looking for the\ntruth in YOU. This is not going BEYOND yourself, but TOWARD yourself. Hear only\nGod's answer in His Sons, and YOU are answered.\n\nTo disbelieve is to side AGAINST, or to ATTACK. To believe is to\naccept, and SIDE WITH. To believe is not to be credulous, but to accept and\nAPPRECIATE. What you do NOT believe you do NOT APPRECIATE, and you CANNOT be\ngrateful for what you do not VALUE. There is a price you will pay for judgment,\nbecause judgment IS the setting of price. And as you set it, you WILL pay it.\n\nIf paying is equated with GETTING, you will set the PRICE low, but\ndemand a high RETURN. But you will have forgotten that to price is to VALUE, so\nthat YOUR return is IN PROPORTION TO YOUR JUDGMENT OF WORTH. If paying is\nassociated with giving, IT CANNOT BE PERCEIVED AS LOSS, and the RECIPROCAL\nrelationship of giving and RECEIVING will be recognized. The price will then be\nset high, because of the value of the RETURN.\n\nTo price for GETTING is to LOSE SIGHT OF VALUE, making it inevitable\nthat you will NOT value what you receive. Valuing it little, you will not\nappreciate it, and you will not WANT it. Never forget, then, that YOU have set\nthe value on what you receive, and have priced it BY what you give. To believe\nthat it is possible to get much FOR little, is to believe that you can bargain\nwith God.\n\nGod's laws are ALWAYS fair, and PERFECTLY consistent. BY giving, you\nreceive. But to receive is to ACCEPT, NOT to get. It is impossible not to HAVE,\nbut it IS possible NOT TO KNOW YOU HAVE. The recognition of HAVING is the\nwillingness for GIVING, and ONLY by this willingness, can you RECOGNIZE what you\nhave. What you give is therefore the value you put on what you have, being the\nexact measure of the value you PUT upon it. And this, in turn, is the measure of\nHOW MUCH YOU WANT IT.\n\nYou can ASK of the Holy Spirit, then, ONLY by giving TO Him. And you\ncan GIVE to Him only WHERE YOU SEE HIM. If you SEE Him in everyone, consider how\nmuch you will be asking OF Him, and HOW MUCH YOU WILL RECEIVE. He will deny you\nnothing, because you have denied Him nothing, and so you can SHARE EVERYTHING.\nThis is the way, and the ONLY way, to have His answer, because His answer is all\nyou can ask for and WANT. Say, then, to everyone,\n",

If you do not hear HIM, you are listening to YOUR ego, and making as\nlittle sense as the brother whose errors you perceive. This CANNOT be correction.\nBut it is more than merely lack of correction for him. It is the GIVING UP of\ncorrection in YOURSELF.\n\nWhen a brother behaves insanely, you can heal him ONLY by perceiving\nthe SANITY in him. If you perceive his errors and ACCEPT them, you are accepting\nYOURS. If you want to give YOURS over to the Holy Spirit, you must do this with\nHIS. Unless this becomes the ONE way in which you handle ALL errors, you cannot\nunderstand HOW ALL ERRORS ARE UNDONE. How is this different from telling you that\nwhat you teach you LEARN? Your brother is as right as you are. And if you think\nhe is WRONG, you are condemning YOURSELF.\n\nYOU cannot correct YOURSELF. Is it possible, then, for you to correct\nanother? But you CAN see him truly, because it IS possible for you to see\nYOURSELF truly. It is not up to you to CHANGE him, but merely to accept him AS HE\nIS. His errors do not come from the truth that is in him, and ONLY this truth is\nyours. His errors cannot change this, and can have no effect at all on the truth\nin YOU.\n\nTo perceive errors in anyone, and to REACT to them AS IF THEY WERE\nREAL, is to MAKE them real to you.

Look, then, BEYOND error,\nand do not let your perception rest UPON it, for you will believe what your\nperception HOLDS. Accept as true only what your brother IS, if you would know\nyourself. Perceive what he is NOT, and you CANNOT know what you are, BECAUSE you\nsee HIM falsely. Remember always that your identity is shared, and that its\nsharing IS its reality.\n\nYou have a PART to play in the Atonement. But the plan of the\nAtonement IS beyond you. You do not know how to OVERLOOK errors, or you would not\nmake them. It would merely be further error to think either that you do NOT make\nthem, or that you can CORRECT them without a GUIDE TO CORRECTION. And if you do\nnot FOLLOW this Guide, your errors will NOT be corrected. The plan is not yours\nBECAUSE of your limited ideas about WHAT YOU ARE. But this limitation IS where\nALL ERRORS ARISE. The way to UNDO them is, therefore, not OF you, but FOR you.\n\nThe Atonement is a lesson in sharing, which is given you because YOU\nHAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO DO IT. The Holy Spirit merely reminds you of what is your\nNATURAL ability. By RE-INTERPRETING the ability to ATTACK, which you DID make,\ninto the ability to SHARE, He TRANSLATES what you have made, into what God\ncreated. But if you would accomplish this THROUGH Him, you cannot look on your\nabilities through the eyes of the ego, or you will judge them as IT does. All\ntheir harmfullness lies in ITS judgment. All their HELPFULLNESS lies in the judgment of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe ego has a plan of forgiveness, because you are ASKING for one, but\nnot of the right teacher. The EGO'S plan, of course, MAKES NO SENSE and WILL NOT\nWORK. By following it, you will merely place yourself in an impossible situation,\nto which the ego ALWAYS leads you. Its plan is to have you SEE ERROR CLEARLY\nFIRST, and THEN overlook it. But how CAN you overlook what you have made real? By\nseeing it clearly, you HAVE made it real, and CANNOT overlook it.\n\nThis is where the ego is forced into appealing to mysteries, and\nbegins to insist that you accept the meaningless, to save yourself. Many have\ntried to do this in my name, forgetting that my words make PERFECT sense, because\nthey come from GOD. They are as sensible now as they ever were, because they\nspeak of ideas which are eternal. Forgiveness that is learned of ME does not use\nfear to UNDO fear. Nor does it make real the UNreal, and then destroy it.\n\nForgiveness through the Holy Spirit lies simply in looking beyond\nerror from the beginning, and thus KEEPING it unreal for you. Do not let any\nbelief in its realness enter your minds AT ALL, or you will also believe that\nyou must UNDO what you have made, in order to BE forgiven. What has no effect\ndoes not exist, and to the Holy Spirit, the effects of error are TOTALLY nonexistent.\nBy steadily and consistently cancelling out ALL its effects, EVERYWHERE\nAND IN ALL RESPECTS, He teaches that the ego does not exist, and PROVES IT.\nFollow His teaching in forgiveness, then, because forgiveness IS His function,\nand HE knows how to fulfill it perfectly.\nThat is what we meant when we once said that miracles are NATURAL, and when they\ndo NOT occur, something has gone wrong. Miracles are merely the sign of your\nwillingness to follow HIS plan of Salvation, in recognition of the FACT that you\ndo NOT know what it is. His work is NOT your function, and unless you accept\nthis, you CANNOT learn what your function IS.\n\nThe confusion of functions is so typical of the ego, that you should\nbe quite familiar with it by now. The ego believes that ALL functions belong to\nIT, even though it has no idea what they ARE. This is more than mere confusion.\nIt is a particularly dangerous combination of grandiosity AND confusion, that\nmakes it likely that the ego will attack anyone and anything, for no reason at\nall. This is exactly what it DOES. It is TOTALLY unpredictable in its responses,\nbecause it has no idea WHAT it heard.\n\nIf one has no idea what is happening, how appropriately can you EXPECT\nhim to react? But you might still ask yourself, regardless of how you can ACCOUNT\nfor the reactions, whether they place the ego in a very sound position as a guide\nfor YOURS. It seems absurd to have to emphasize repeatedly that the ego's\nqualifications as a guide are singularly unfortunate, and that it is a remarkably\npoor choice as a teacher of salvation. Yet this question, ridiculous as it seems,\nis REALLY the crucial issue in the whole separation fantasy.\n\nAnyone who elects a totally insane guide, MUST be totally insane\nhimself. It is not true that you do not know the guide is insane. YOU know it\nbecause I know it, and you HAVE judged it by the same Standard as I have. The ego\nliterally lives on borrowed time, and ITS days ARE numbered. Do not fear the last\njudgment, but welcome it and do not wait, for the ego's time is\nborrowed from YOUR eternity. This IS the Second Coming, which was made FOR you,\nas the First was created.\n\nThe Second Coming is merely the return of SENSE. Can this POSSIBLY be\nfearful? What can be fearful but fantasy, and no one turns to fantasy unless he\ndespairs of satisfaction in reality. But it is CERTAIN that he will NEVER find\nsatisfaction in fantasy, so that his ONLY hope is to change his mind about\nREALITY. Only if the decision that reality is fearful is WRONG, can GOD be right.\nAnd I ASSURE you that God IS right.\n\nBe glad, then, that you HAVE been wrong, but this was only because you\ndid not know who you WERE. Had you REMEMBERED, you could no more have been wrong\nthan God can. The impossible can happen ONLY in fantasy. When you search for\nreality in fantasies, you will not find it. The symbols of fantasy are of the\nego, and of THESE you will find many. But do not look for meaning in them. They\nhave no more meaning than the fantasies into which they are woven.\n\nFairy tales can be pleasant or fearful, pretty or ugly, but NO ONE\ncalls them TRUE. Children may believe them, and so, for a while, they ARE true\nfor them. But when Reality dawns, they are gone. REALITY has NOT gone in the\nmeanwhile. The Second Coming is the AWARENESS of Reality, not its RETURN.\nBehold, my children, Reality is here. It belongs to you and me and God, and is\nperfectly satisfying to all of us. Only THIS awareness heals, because it is the\nawareness of truth.",

    "content": "The Unhealed Healer\n\nThe ego's plan for forgiveness is far more widely used than God's.\nThis is because it is undertaken by unhealed healers, and IS therefore of the\nego. Let us consider the unhealed healer more carefully now. By definition, he is\ntrying to GIVE what he has NOT received. If he is a theologian, he may begin with\nthe premise, “I am a miserable sinner, and so are you.” If he is a\npsychotherapist, he is more likely to start with the equally incredible idea that\nHE really believes in attack, and so does the patient, but it does not matter in\nEITHER case.\n\nWe have repeatedly stated that beliefs of the ego CANNOT be shared,\nand THIS IS WHY THEY ARE NOT REAL. How, then, can UNCOVERING them MAKE them real?\nEvery healer who searches fantasies for truth MUST be unhealed, because he DOES\nNOT KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR TRUTH, and therefore does not have the answer to the\nproblem of healing. There IS an advantage to bringing nightmares into awareness,\nbut ONLY to teach that they are NOT real, and that ANYTHING they contain is\nmeaningless. The unhealed healer cannot DO this, because he does not BELIEVE it.\n\nAll unhealed healers follow the ego's plan for forgiveness, in one\nform or another. If they are theologians, they are likely to condemn THEMSELVES,\nTEACH condemnation, and advocate a very fearful solution. Projecting condemnation\nonto God, they make Him retaliative, and FEAR HIS RETRIBUTION. What they have\ndone is merely to IDENTIFY with the ego, and by perceiving clearly what IT does,\ncondemn THEMSELVES because of this profound confusion.\n\nIt is understandable that there has been a revolt against this\nconcept, but to revolt AGAINST it, is still to BELIEVE in it. The FORM of the\nrevolt, then, is different, but NOT the content.\nThe new form of the ego's plan is as unhelpful as the older one, because form\ndoes not matter to the Holy Spirit, and therefore DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL.\nAccording to the newer forms of the plan, the therapist interprets the ego's\nsymbols IN the nightmare, and uses them to PROVE THE NIGHTMARE IS REAL. Having\nMADE it real, he then attempts to dispel its EFFECTS by DEPRECIATING THE\nIMPORTANCE OF THE DREAMER.\n\nThis WOULD be a healing approach, IF THE DREAMER were properly\nidentified AS UNREAL. But if the dreamer is equated WITH the mind, the mind's\ncorrective power, through the Holy Spirit, is DENIED. It is noteworthy that this\nis a contradiction even in the ego's own terms, and one which it usually DOES\nnote, even in its confusion. If the way to counteract fear is to reduce the\nimportance of the FEARER, how can this build up ego STRENGTH? These perfectly\nself-evident inconsistencies account for why, except for certain stylized verbal\naccounts, NOBODY can EXPLAIN what happens in psychotherapy. Nothing real DOES.\n\nNothing REAL has happened to the unhealed healer, and HE LEARNS FROM\nHIS OWN TEACHING. BECAUSE his ego is involved, it ALWAYS attempts to gain some\nsupport from the situation. Seeking to GET something for HIMSELF, the healer does\nNOT know how to give, and consequently CANNOT SHARE. He CANNOT correct, because\nhe is not working CORRECTIVELY. He believes that it is up to him to teach the\npatient what is REAL, but he does not know it HIMSELF.\n\nT 9 D 7. What, then, SHOULD happen? When God said: “Let there be Light,”\nthere WAS light. Can you find light by ANALYZING darkness as the psychotherapist\ndoes, or like the theologian, by ACKNOWLEDGING it in yourself, and looking for a\ndistant light to remove it, while emphasizing the distance?\n\nHealing is NOT mysterious. Nothing occurs UNLESS you understand it,\nsince light IS understanding. A “miserable sinner” cannot be healed without\nmagic, nor can an “unimportant mind” esteem itself without magic. Both forms of\nthe ego's approach, then, MUST arrive at an impasse, the characteristic\n“impossible situation” to which the ego ALWAYS leads.\n\nIt CAN be helpful to point out to a patient WHERE HE IS HEADING, but\nthe point is LOST unless he can change his direction. The therapist cannot do\nthis for him, but he also CANNOT DO THIS FOR HIMSELF. His only MEANINGFUL\ncontribution is to present an example of one whose direction has been changed FOR\nhim, and who NO LONGER BELIEVES IN NIGHTMARES OF ANY KIND. The light in HIS mind\nwill therefore ANSWER the questioner, who MUST decide with God that there IS\nlight BECAUSE HE SEES IT. And by HIS acknowledgment, THE THERAPIST KNOWS IT IS\nTHERE.\n\nThat is how perception ultimately is translated into knowledge. The\nmiracle-worker begins by PERCEIVING light, and translates HIS perception into\nsureness by continually extending it, and ACCEPTING ITS ACKNOWLEDGMENT. Its\nEFFECTS assure him IT IS THERE. The therapist does not heal; he LETS HEALING BE.\nHE can point to darkness, but he CANNOT bring light OF HIMSELF, for light is NOT\nof him. But being FOR him, it MUST be for his patient.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the ONLY therapist. He makes healing PERFECTLY\nclear in ANY situation in which He is the guide. The human therapist can only\nLET HIM FULFILL HIS FUNCTION. He needs no help for this. He WILL tell you EXACTLY\nwhat to do, to help ANYONE He sends to you FOR help, and will speak to him\nthrough you, IF YOU DO NOT INTERFERE. Remember that you\nARE choosing a guide for helping, and the wrong choice will NOT help. But\nremember also that THE RIGHT ONE WILL. Trust Him, for help is His function, and\nHe is of God.\n\nAs you awaken other minds TO Him through HIM, and not yourself, you\nwill understand that you are not obeying the laws of this world, but that the\nlaws you ARE obeying WORK. “The good is what works” is a sound though\ninsufficient statement. ONLY the good CAN work. Nothing else works at all. This\ncourse is a guide to behavior. Being a very direct and very simple learning\nsituation, it provides the guide who tells you what to do. If you do it, you will\nSEE that it works. Its RESULTS are more convincing than its words. THEY will\nconvince you that the words are true.\n\nBy following the right Guide, you will learn the simplest of all\nlessons: “By their fruits ye shall know them, and THEY shall know THEMSELVES.”",

    "content": "The Awareness of the Holy Spirit\n\nHow can you become increasingly aware of the Holy Spirit in you,\nEXCEPT by His EFFECTS? You cannot see Him with your eyes, nor hear Him with your\nears. How, then, can you perceive Him at all? If you INSPIRE joy, and others\nreact to you WITH joy, even though you are not experiencing joy yourself, there\nmust be SOMETHING IN YOU that IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING IT. If it is in YOU, and\nCAN produce joy, and if you see that it DOES produce joy in others, you MUST be\ndissociating it in yourself.\n\nIt seems to you that the Holy Spirit does not produce joy consistently\nin you, ONLY because YOU DO NOT CONSISTENTLY AROUSE JOY IN OTHERS. Their\nreactions to you ARE your evaluations of His consistency. When you are\ninconsistent, you will not always GIVE RISE to joy, and so you will not always\nrecognize HIS consistency. What you offer to your brother, you offer to Him,\nbecause He cannot GO BEYOND your offering in HIS giving. This is NOT because HE\nlimits His giving, but simply because YOU have limited your RECEIVING.\n\nThe will to receive is the will to accept. If your brothers ARE part\nof you, will you ACCEPT them? Only they can teach you what you are, and your\nlearning is the result of what you taught THEM. What you call upon in them, you\ncall upon in YOURSELF. And as you call upon it IN THEM, it becomes real to YOU.\nGod has but one Son, knowing them all as One. Only God Himself is more than they,\nbut they are not less than He is. Would you know what this means? If what you do\nto my brother you do to me, and if you do everything for yourself because we\nare PART of you, everything WE do belongs to you as well. Every Soul God created\nis part of you, and shares His glory WITH you.\n\nHis glory belongs to Him, but it is equally YOURS. You cannot, then,\nBE less glorious than He is. He is more than you ONLY because He CREATED you, but\nnot even this would He keep from you. Therefore, you CAN create as He did, and\nYOUR dissociation WILL NOT ALTER THIS. Neither God's Light nor YOURS is dimmed\nbecause you do not see.\n\nBecause the Sonship MUST create as one, you remember creation whenever\nyou recognize part of creation. Each part you remember adds to YOUR wholeness,\nbecause each part IS whole. Wholeness is indivisible, but you cannot learn YOUR\nwholeness, UNTIL YOU SEE IT EVERYWHERE. You can know yourself only as God knows\nHis Son, for KNOWLEDGE is shared WITH God. When you awake in Him, you will know\nyour magnitude by accepting HIS limitlessness as YOURS. But meanwhile, you will\njudge it as you judge your brothers', and will accept it as you accept theirs.\n\nYou are not yet awake, but you can learn HOW to awaken. Very simply\nthe Holy Spirit teaches you to awaken others. As you see them waken, you will\nlearn WHAT WAKING MEANS. And because you have willed to wake them, their\ngratitude, and their appreciation of what you have given them, will TEACH YOU ITS\nVALUE. THEY will become the witnesses to your reality, as YOU were created\nwitnesses to God's. But when the Sonship COMES TOGETHER and accepts its oneness,\nit will be known by ITS creations, who witness to its reality, as the Son does to\nthe Father.\n\nMiracles have no place in eternity because they are reparative. But\nwhile you still need healing, your miracles are the only witnesses to your\nreality THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE.\nYou cannot perform a miracle FOR YOURSELF, because miracles are a way of GIVING\nACCEPTANCE AND receiving it. In TIME, the giving comes FIRST, though they are\nsimultaneous in eternity, where they cannot BE separated. When you have learned\nthat they ARE the same, the need for time is over. Eternity is ONE time, its ONLY\ndimension being “always.”\n\nBut this cannot mean anything to you, until you remember God's open\narms, and finally know His open Mind. Like Him, YOU are ALWAYS, in His Mind, and\nwith a mind like His. In your open mind are YOUR creations, in perfect\ncommunication, born of perfect understanding. Could you but accept one of them,\nyou would not want ANYTHING the world has to offer. Everything else would be\ntotally meaningless. God's meaning is incomplete without you, and you are\nincomplete without your creations.\n\nAccept your brother in this world, and accept NOTHING ELSE, for in him\nyou will find your creations, because he created them WITH you. You will never\nknow that you are co-creator with God, until you learn that your brother is a cocreator\nwith YOU.\n",

    "content": "Salvation and God's Will\n\nGod's Will is your salvation. Would He not have given you the means to\nfind it? If He wills you to HAVE it, He MUST have made it possible, and very easy\nto obtain it.\n\nYour brothers are everywhere. You do not have to seek far for\nsalvation. Every minute and every second gives you a chance to save YOURSELF. Do\nnot lose these chances, NOT because they will not return, but because delay of\njoy is needless. God wills you perfect happiness NOW. Is it possible that this is\nnot also YOUR will? And is it possible that this is not ALSO the will of your\nbrothers? Consider, then, that in this joint will, you ARE all united, and IN\nTHIS ONLY. There WILL be disagreement on anything ELSE, but NOT in this. This,\nthen, is where peace ABIDES. And YOU abide in peace, when you so decide.\n\nBut you cannot abide in peace unless you accept the Atonement, because\nthe Atonement IS the way to peace. The reason is very simple, and so obvious that\nit is often overlooked. That is because the ego is AFRAID of the obvious, since\nobviousness is the essential characteristic of reality. You CANNOT overlook it,\nunless you are NOT LOOKING. It is PERFECTLY obvious that if the Holy Spirit looks\nwith love on all He perceives, He looks with love on YOU. His EVALUATION of you\nis based on his knowledge of what you ARE, and so He evaluates you truly. And\nthis evaluation MUST be in your mind, because HE is.\n\nThe ego is also in your mind, because you have ACCEPTED it there. ITS\nevaluation of you, however, is the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit's, because\nthe ego does NOT love you. It is unaware of what you are, and wholly mistrustful\nof EVERYTHING it perceives, because its own perceptions are so shifting. The ego\nis therefore capable of suspiciousness at best, and viciousness at worst. That is\nits range. It cannot exceed it, because of its uncertainty. And it can never go\nBEYOND it, because it can never BE certain.\n\nYou, then, have two conflicting evaluations of yourself in your minds,\nand they CANNOT BOTH BE TRUE. You do not yet realize how COMPLETELY different\nthese evaluations are, because you do not understand how lofty the Holy Spirit's\nperception of you really is. He is not deceived by ANYTHING you do, because He\nNEVER forgets what you are. The ego is deceived by EVERYTHING you do, even when\nyou respond to the Holy Spirit, because at such times ITS CONFUSION INCREASES.\nThe ego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react lovingly,\nbecause it has evaluated you AS UNLOVING, and you are going AGAINST ITS JUDGMENT.\n\nThe ego will begin to ATTACK your motives as soon as they become\nclearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift\nabruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, because its uncertainty is\nINCREASED. But it is surely pointless to attack in return. What can this mean,\nexcept that you are AGREEING with the ego's evaluation of what you are? If you\nare willing to see yourself as unloving, YOU WILL NOT BE HAPPY. You are\ncondemning yourself, and MUST therefore regard yourself as inadequate.\n\nWould you look to the ego to help you escape from a sense of\ninadequacy it has PRODUCED, and must MAINTAIN for its own existence? Can you\nESCAPE from its evaluation of you, by using its methods for keeping this picture\nINTACT? You cannot evaluate an insane belief system from WITHIN it. Its own range\nprecludes this. You can only GO BEYOND it, and look back from a point where\nSANITY exists, and SEE THE CONTRAST. Only BY this contrast, can insanity be\njudged as insane.\n\nWith the grandeur of God in you, you have chosen to be little, and\nlament your littleness. Within the system which DICTATED this choice, the lament\nIS inevitable. Your littleness is TAKEN FOR GRANTED there, and you do NOT ask who\ngranted it. The question is meaningless WITHIN the ego's thought-system, because\nit OPENS THE WHOLE THOUGHT-SYSTEM TO QUESTION. We said before that the ego does\nnot know what a real question is. Lack of knowledge of ANY kind is ALWAYS\nassociated with UNWILLINGNESS to know, and produces a TOTAL lack of knowledge,\nsimply because KNOWLEDGE is total. NOT to question your littleness is, therefore,\nto deny ALL knowledge, and keep the ego's WHOLE thought-system intact.\n\nYou cannot retain PART of a thought-system, because it can BE\nquestioned only at its foundation. And this MUST be questioned from beyond it,\nbecause WITHIN it, its foundation DOES stand. The Holy Spirit judges against the\nreality of the ego's thought-system, merely because He knows its FOUNDATION is\nnot true. Therefore, nothing that arises from it MEANS anything. The Holy Spirit\njudges every belief you hold in terms of where it comes from. If it comes from\nGod,\nHe knows it to be true. If it does not, He knows it is meaningless.\n\nWhenever you question your value, say, “God Himself is incomplete\nwithout me.” Remember this when the ego speaks, and you will not hear it. The\ntruth about YOU is so lofty that nothing that is unworthy of God is worthy of\nyou. Choose, then, what you want in these terms, and accept nothing that you\nwould not offer to God as wholly fitting for HIM, for YOU do not want anything\nelse. Return your part of Him, and He will give you all of Himself, in exchange\nfor your return of what belongs to Him, and renders Him complete.",

    "content": "Grandeur versus Grandiosity\n\nGrandeur is of God, and ONLY of Him. Therefore, it is in you. Whenever\nyou become aware of it, however dimly, you abandon the ego automatically, because\nin the presence of the grandeur of God, the meaninglessness of the ego becomes\nperfectly apparent. Though it does not understand this, the ego believes that its\n“enemy” has struck, and attempts to offer gifts to induce you to return to its\nprotection. SELF-inflation is the only offering it can make. The grandiosity of\nthe ego is its alternative to the grandeur of God. Which will you choose?\n\nGrandiosity is ALWAYS a cover for despair. It is without hope, because\nit is not real. It is an attempt to COUNTERACT your littleness, based on the\nbelief THAT THE LITTLENESS IS REAL. WITHOUT this belief, the grandiosity is\nmeaningless, and you could not possibly WANT it. The essence of grandiosity is\ncompetitiveness, because it ALWAYS involves ATTACK. It is a delusional attempt to\nOUTDO, but NOT to UNdo. We said before that the ego vacillates between\nsuspiciousness and viciousness. It remains suspicious as long as you DESPAIR of\nyourself. It shifts to viciousness whenever you will not tolerate selfdebasement,\nand seek relief. Then it offers you the delusion of ATTACK as a\nsolution.\n\nThe ego does not know the difference between grandeur and grandiosity,\nbecause it does not know the difference between miracle-impulses and ego-alien\nbeliefs of its own. We once said that the ego IS aware of threat, but does NOT\nmake distinctions between two ENTIRELY different kinds of threat to its\nexistence. Its own PROFOUND sense of vulnerability renders it incapable of\njudgment, EXCEPT in terms of attack. When it experiences threat, its ONLY\ndecision is whether to attack NOW, or withdraw to attack later. If you ACCEPT its\noffer of grandiosity, it will attack immediately. If you do not, it will wait.\n\nThe ego is immobilized in the presence of God's grandeur, because HIS\ngrandeur establishes YOUR freedom. Even the faintest hint of your reality\nliterally drives the ego from your mind, because of the complete lack of\ninvestment in it. Grandeur is totally WITHOUT illusion, and because it is real,\nit is compellingly convincing. But the conviction of reality will not REMAIN with\nyou, UNLESS YOU DO NOT ALLOW THE EGO TO ATTACK IT.\n\nThe ego will make every effort to recover, and mobilize its energies\nAGAINST your release. It will tell you that you are insane, and argue that\ngrandeur CANNOT be a real part of you, because of the littleness in which IT\nbelieves. But your grandeur is NOT delusional, BECAUSE YOU DID NOT MAKE IT. YOU\nhave made grandiosity, and are afraid of it, because it is a form of ATTACK. But\nyour grandeur is of God, who created it out of His love. From your grandeur you\ncan only bless, because your grandeur is your ABUNDANCE. By blessing you hold it\nin your minds, protecting it from illusions, and keeping yourself in the Mind of\nGod.\n\nRemember always that you cannot be anywhere EXCEPT in the Mind of\nGod. When you FORGET this, you WILL despair, and you WILL attack. The ego depends\nSOLELY on your willingness to tolerate it. But if you are willing to look upon\nyour grandeur, you CANNOT despair, and therefore you CANNOT want the ego. Your\ngrandeur is God's ANSWER to the ego, because it is true.\nLittleness and grandeur cannot co-exist, nor is it possible for them to alternate\nin your awareness. Littleness and grandiosity can and MUST, since both are\nuntrue, and therefore on the same level. Being the level of shift, it is\nexperienced as shifting, and extremes are its essential characteristic.\n\nBut truth and littleness are DENIALS of each other, and grandeur IS\ntruth. Truth does not vacillate; it is ALWAYS true. When grandeur slips away from\nyou, YOU HAVE REPLACED IT WITH SOMETHING YOU HAVE MADE. Perhaps it is the belief\nin littleness; perhaps it is the belief in grandiosity. But it MUST be insane,\nbecause it is NOT TRUE. Your grandeur will NEVER deceive you, but your illusions\nALWAYS will. Illusions ARE deceptions.\n\nYou CANNOT triumph, but you ARE exalted. And in your exalted state,\nyou seek others like you, and rejoice with them. It is easy to distinguish\ngrandeur from grandiosity, simply because love is returned, but pride is not.\nPride will not produce miracles, and therefore will deprive you of the true\nwitnesses to your reality. Truth is not obscure nor hidden, but its obviousness\nto YOU lies in the joy you bring to its witnesses, WHO SHOW IT TO YOU. They\nattest to your grandeur, but they cannot attest to pride because pride is not\nshared.\n\nGod WANTS you to behold what He created, because it is HIS joy. Can\nyour grandeur be arrogant, when God HIMSELF witnesses to it? And what can be real\nthat has NO witnesses? What good can come of it? And if no good can come of it,\nthe Holy Spirit cannot use it. What He cannot TRANSFORM to the Will of God does\nnot exist at all. Grandiosity is delusional because it is used to REPLACE your\ngrandeur. Yet what God has created cannot BE replaced.\n\nGod is incomplete without you, simply because His grandeur is total,\nand you cannot BE missing from it. You are altogether irreplaceable in the Mind\nof God. No one else can fill your part of it, and while you leave your part of it\nempty, your eternal place merely waits for your return. God, through His Voice,\nreminds you of it, and God Himself keeps your extensions safe within it. But YOU\ndo not know them, until you return TO them.\n\nYou CANNOT replace the Kingdom, and you cannot replace yourself. God,\nWho KNOWS your value, would not have it so, and so it is NOT so. Your value is in\nGOD'S Mind, and therefore NOT in yours alone. To accept yourself as He created\nyou CANNOT be arrogant, because it is the DENIAL of arrogance. To accept your\nlittleness IS arrogant, because it means that you believe that YOUR evaluation of\nyourself is TRUER THAN GOD'S. But if truth is indivisible, then YOUR evaluation\nof yourself MUST BE GOD'S.\n\nYou did not ESTABLISH your value, and it needs no defense. NOTHING can\nattack it, or prevail over it. It does not vary. It merely IS. Ask the Holy\nSpirit WHAT it is, and He will tell you. But do not be afraid of His Answer, for\nit comes from God. It IS an exalted answer, because of its Source. But the Source\nis true, and so is its answer. Listen and do not question what you hear, for God",

But remember that IT IS AS IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD. The law of\nCreation is that you love your creations as yourself, BECAUSE THEY ARE PART OF\nYOU. Everything that was created is therefore PERFECTLY safe, because the laws of\nGod protect it by His love. Any part of your mind that does not know this, has\nbanished itself from knowledge, because it has NOT MET ITS CONDITIONS.\n\nWho could have done this but you? Recognize this gladly, for in this\nrecognition lies the realization that your banishment is not of God, and\ntherefore does not exist. You are at home in God, dreaming of exile, but\nperfectly capable of awakening to Reality. Is it your will to do so? You know,\nfrom your own experience, that what you see in dreams you think is real, as long\nas you are asleep. But the instant you waken, you KNOW that everything that\nSEEMED to happen DID NOT HAPPEN AT ALL. You do not think this mysterious, even\nthough ALL the laws of what you awake to WERE violated while you slept.\n\nIs it not possible that you merely shifted from one dream to another\nwithout really wakening? Would you bother to reconcile what happened in\nconflicting DREAMS, or would you dismiss BOTH TOGETHER, if you discovered that\nREALITY is in accord with neither? You do not remember being awake. When you hear\nthe Holy Spirit, you merely feel BETTER, because loving seems POSSIBLE to you.\nBut you do NOT remember yet that it once was so, and it is in this remembering\nthat you will know it can be so again.\n\nWhat is possible has not yet been accomplished. But what has once been\nis so now, if it is eternal. When you remember, you will know what you remember\nIS eternal, and therefore is NOW.\n\nYou will remember everything the instant you DESIRE IT WHOLLY, for if\nto desire wholly is to create, you will have willed away the separation,\nreturning your mind simultaneously to your Creator and your creations.

    "content": "The Decision to Forget\n\nUnless you KNOW something, you CANNOT dissociate it. Knowledge\ntherefore PRECEDES dissociation, and dissociation is nothing more than a DECISION\nTO FORGET. What has been FORGOTTEN then appears to be fearful, but ONLY because\nthe dissociation was an ATTACK ON TRUTH. You are fearful BECAUSE you have\nforgotten. And you have REPLACED your knowledge by an awareness of dreams,\nBECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF YOUR DISSOCIATION, NOT of what you have dissociated.\nEven in this world's therapy, when dissociated material is ACCEPTED, it ceases to\nbe fearful, for the laws of mind always hold.\n\nBut to give up the dissociation of REALITY brings more than merely\nlack of fear. In THIS decision lie joy, and peace, and the glory of creation.\nOffer the Holy Spirit only your will to remember, for He retains the knowledge of\nGod and of you FOR you, waiting for your acceptance. Give up gladly EVERYTHING\nthat would stand in the way of your remembering, for God is in your memory, and\nHis Voice will tell you that you are part of Him when you are willing to remember\nHim and know your own reality again. Let nothing in this world delay your\nremembering of Him, for in this remembering is the knowledge of YOURSELF.\n\nTo remember is merely to restore to your mind WHAT IS ALREADY THERE.\nYou do not make what you remember; you merely accept again what has BEEN made AND\nREJECTED. The ability to ACCEPT truth in this world is the perceptual counterpart\nof creating in the Kingdom. God WILL do His part\nif you will do yours, and HIS return in exchange for yours IS the exchange of\nknowledge for perception. NOTHING is beyond His will for you. But signify your\nwill to remember Him, and behold! He will give you everything but for your\nasking.\n\nWhenever you attack, you are denying YOURSELF. You are specifically\nteaching yourself that you are NOT what you are. YOUR denial of reality precludes\nACCEPTANCE of God's gift, BECAUSE YOU HAVE ACCEPTED SOMETHING ELSE IN ITS PLACE.\nIf you understand that the misuse of defenses always constitutes an attack on\ntruth, and truth is God, you will realize why this is ALWAYS fearful. If you\nfurther recognize that you are PART of God, you will also understand why it is\nthat YOU ALWAYS ATTACK YOURSELF FIRST.\n\nALL attack is self attack. It cannot BE anything else. Arising from\nyour OWN decision NOT to be what you ARE, IT IS AN ATTACK ON YOUR IDENTIFICATION.\nAttack is thus the way in which your identification is lost, because, when you\nattack, you MUST have forgotten what you are. And if your reality is God's, when\nYOU attack, you are not remembering HIM. This is not because He is gone, but\nbecause you are ACTIVELY WILLING NOT TO REMEMBER HIM.\n\nIf you realized the complete havoc this makes of your peace of mind,\nyou COULD not make such an insane decision. You make it only because you still\nbelieve that it can GET YOU SOMETHING YOU WANT. It follows, then, that you want\nsomething OTHER than peace of mind, and you have not considered what it must be.\nYet the logical outcome of your decision is perfectly clear, if you will LOOK at\nit. By deciding AGAINST your reality, you have made yourself vigilant AGAINST God\nand His Kingdom. And it is THIS vigilance that makes you afraid to remember Him.\n\nYou have NOT attacked God, and you DO love Him. Can you change your\nreality? No-one can will to destroy himself. When you think you are attacking\nyour SELF, it is a sure sign that you hate what you think you are. And this, and\nONLY this, can BE attacked by you. What you THINK you are CAN be hateful, and\nwhat this strange image makes you do can be very destructive. The destruction is\nno more real than the image, but those who make idols DO worship them. The idols\nare nothing, but their worshippers are the Sons of God in sickness.\n\nGod would have them released from their sickness, and returned to His\nMind. He will not limit your power to help them, because He has given it TO you.\nDo not be afraid of it, because it is your salvation. What Comforter can there be\nfor the sick children of God except His power through YOU? Remember that it does\nnot matter where in the Sonship He is accepted. He is ALWAYS accepted for all,\nand when your mind receives Him, the remembrance of Him awakens throughout the\nSonship.\n\nHeal your brothers simply by accepting God FOR them. Your minds are\nnot separate, and God has only one channel for healing, because He has but one\nSon. His remaining communication link with all His Children joins them together,\nand them to Him. To be aware of this is to heal them, because it is the awareness\nthat no one is separate, and so no one is sick. To believe that a Son of God can\nbe sick is to believe that PART OF GOD CAN SUFFER.\n\nLove CANNOT suffer, because it cannot attack. The remembrance of love\ntherefore brings invulnerability with it. Do not side with sickness in the\npresence of a Son of God, even if HE believes in it, for YOUR acceptance of God\nin him ACKNOWLEDGES the love of God which he has forgotten. Your recognition of\nhim as PART OF GOD teaches him the truth about himself, WHICH HE IS DENYING.\nWould you STRENGTHEN his denial of God, and thus lose sight of YOURSELF? Or would\nyou remind him of his wholeness, and remember your Creator WITH him?\n\nTo believe a Son of God is sick is to worship the same idol he does.\nGod created love, NOT idolatry. ALL forms of idolatry are caricatures of\ncreation, taught by sick minds, who are too divided to know that Creation SHARES\npower, and NEVER usurps it. Sickness is idolatry, because it is the belief that\nPOWER CAN BE TAKEN FROM YOU. But this is impossible, because you are part of God,\nWho IS all power. A sick god MUST be an idol, made in the image of what its maker\nthinks HE is. And that is exactly what the ego DOES perceive in a Son of God; --\na sick god, self-created, self-sufficient, very vicious, and very vulnerable.\n\nIs this the idol you would worship? Is this the image you would be\nvigilant to SAVE? Are you REALLY afraid of losing THIS? Look calmly at the\nlogical conclusion of the ego's thought-system, and judge whether its offering is\nreally what you want, for this IS what it offers you. To obtain THIS, you are\nwilling to attack the Divinity of your brothers, and thus lose sight of YOURS.\nAnd you are willing to keep it hidden, to protect this idol, which you think will\nsave you from dangers WHICH THE IDOL ITSELF STANDS FOR, but which do not exist.\n\nThere are no idolaters in the Kingdom, but there is great appreciation\nfor every Soul which God created, because of the calm knowledge that each one is\npart of Him. God's Son knows no idols, but He DOES know His Father. Health in\nthis world is the counterpart of value in Heaven. It is not my merit that I\ncontribute to you, but my love, for you do not value yourselves. When you do not\nvalue yourself you become sick, but MY value of you can heal you, because the\nvalue of God's Son is one.\n\nWhen I said, “my peace I give unto you,” I meant it. Peace came from\nGod through me to YOU. It was FOR you, but you did not ask. When a brother is\nsick, it is because HE IS NOT ASKING FOR PEACE, and therefore he does not know he\nHAS it. The ACCEPTANCE of peace is the denial of illusion, and sickness IS an\nillusion. Yet every Son of God has the power to deny illusions ANYWHERE in the\nKingdom, merely by denying them completely in himself.\n\nI CAN heal you, because I KNOW you. I know your value FOR you, and it\nis this value that makes you whole. A whole mind is not idolatrous, and does not\nknow of conflicting laws. I will heal you merely because I have only\nONE message, and it is true. Your faith in it will make you whole, when you have\nfaith in me. I do not bring God's message with deception, and you will learn this\nas you learn that you ALWAYS receive as much as you ACCEPT. You could accept\npeace NOW, for everyone you meet, and offer them perfect freedom from ALL\nillusions, BECAUSE YOU HEARD. But have no other gods before Him, or you will NOT\nhear.\n\nGod is not jealous of the gods you make, but YOU are. You would save\nthem and serve them, because you believe that THEY MADE YOU. You think they are\nyour father, because you are projecting onto them the fearful fact that YOU MADE\nTHEM TO REPLACE GOD. But when they seem to speak to you, remember that NOTHING\ncan replace God, and whatever replacements you have attempted ARE nothing. Very\nsimply, then, you may BELIEVE you are afraid of nothingNESS, but you are REALLY\nafraid of NOTHING. And in THAT awareness you ARE healed.\n\nYou WILL hear the god you listen to. You MADE the god of sickness, and\nBY making him, you made yourself ABLE to hear him. But you did NOT create him,\nbecause he is NOT the Will of the Father. He is therefore not eternal, and will\nbe UNmade for you, the instant you signify your willingness to accept ONLY the\neternal. If God has but one Son, there is but one God. You share reality with\nHim, BECAUSE reality is not divided. To accept other gods before Him, is to place\nother images before YOURSELF. You do not realize how much you listen to your\ngods, and how vigilant you are on their behalf. But they exist only because you\nhonor them.\n\nPlace honor where it is due, and peace WILL be yours. It is your\ninheritance from your REAL Father. You cannot make your father, and the father\nyou made did NOT make you. Honor is not due to illusions, for to honor them is to\nhonor nothing. But fear is not due them either, for nothing cannot be fearful.\nYou have chosen to fear love BECAUSE of its perfect harmlessness. And because of\nthis fear, you have been willing to give up your own perfect helpfullness, and\nyour own perfect Help. Only at the altar of God will you find peace, and this\naltar is in you, because God put it there. His Voice still calls\nyou to return, and He will be heard, when you place no other gods before Him.\n\nYou can give up the god of sickness for your brothers; in fact, you\nwould HAVE to do so, if you give him up for yourself. For if you see him\nanywhere, YOU are accepting him. And if you accept him, you WILL bow down and\nworship him, because HE WAS MADE AS GOD'S REPLACEMENT. He is the belief that YOU",

    "content": "Magic versus Miracles\n\nAll magic is a form of reconciling the irreconcilable. All religion is\nthe recognition that the irreconcilable cannot BE reconciled.\n\nSickness and perfection ARE irreconcilable. If God created you\nperfect, you ARE perfect. If you believe you can be sick, you HAVE placed other\ngods before Him. GOD is not at war with the god of sickness which you made, but\nYOU are. He is the symbol of willing AGAINST God, and you are afraid of him\nBECAUSE he cannot be reconciled with God's will. If you ATTACK him, you will make\nhim real to you. But if you refuse to worship him, in whatever form he may appear\nto you, and wherever you think you see him, he will disappear into the\nnothingness out of which he was made.\n\nReality can dawn only in an unclouded mind. It is always THERE, to BE\naccepted, but its acceptance depends on your WILLINGNESS TO HAVE IT. To know\nreality MUST involve the willingness to judge Unreality FOR WHAT IT IS. This is\nthe RIGHT use of selective perception. To overlook nothingness is merely to judge\nit correctly, and because of your ability to evaluate it truly, to LET IT GO.\nKnowledge cannot dawn on a mind full of illusions, because truth and illusions\nare irreconcilable. Truth is whole, and CANNOT be known by PART of a mind.\n\nThe Sonship cannot be perceived as PARTLY sick, because to perceive it\nthat way, is not to perceive it at all. If the Sonship is ONE, it is one in ALL\nrespects. ONENESS CANNOT BE DIVIDED. If you perceive other gods, YOUR mind is\nsplit, and you will not be able to LIMIT the split, because the split IS the\nsign that you have removed part of your mind from God's Will, and this MEANS that\nit is out of control. To be out of control is to be out of REASON, and the mind\nDOES become unreasonable without reason. This is merely a matter of DEFINITION.\nBy DEFINING the mind wrongly, you perceive it as FUNCTIONING wrongly.\n\nGod's laws will keep your minds at peace, because peace IS His Will,\nand His laws are established to uphold it. His are the laws of freedom, but yours\nare the laws of bondage. Since freedom and bondage are irreconcilable, their laws\nCANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD TOGETHER. The laws of God work only for your good, and there\nARE no other laws beside His. Everything else is merely lawLESS, and therefore\nchaotic. But God Himself has protected EVERYTHING He created BY His laws.\nTherefore, everything that is not under them does not exist.\n\n“Laws of chaos” are meaningless, by definition. Creation is perfectly\nlawful, and the chaotic is without meaning, BECAUSE IT IS WITHOUT GOD. You have\ngiven your peace to the gods you made, but they are not there to take it FROM\nyou, and you are NOT able to give it TO them. You are NOT free to give up\nfreedom, but only to DENY it. YOU CANNOT DO WHAT GOD DID NOT INTEND, because what\nHe did not intend DOES NOT HAPPEN. Your gods do not BRING chaos; you are ENDOWING\nthem with chaos, and accepting it OF them.\n\nAll this has never been. Nothing but the laws of God has ever\noperated, and nothing except His Will will ever be. You were created through His\nlaws and by His Will, and the manner of your creation established you AS\nCREATORS. What you have made is so unworthy of you, that you could hardly want\nit, IF YOU WERE WILLING TO SEE IT AS IT IS. You will see nothing at all. And your\nvision will AUTOMATICALLY look beyond it, to what is IN you, and all AROUND you.\nReality cannot BREAK THROUGH the obstructions you interpose, but it WILL envelop\nyou completely, WHEN YOU LET THEM GO.\n\nWhen you have experienced the protection of God, the making of idols\nbecomes inconceivable. There are no strange images in the Mind of God, and what\nis not in His Mind CANNOT be in yours, because you are of One Mind, and that Mind\nbelongs to HIM. It is yours BECAUSE it belongs to Him, for ownership is sharing\nto Him. And if it is so for Him, it is so for you. His definitions ARE His laws,\nfor by them He established the universe as what it is. No false gods you attempt\nto interpose between yourself and your reality, affect truth at all. Peace is\nyours because God created you. And He created nothing else.\n\nThe miracle is the act of a Son of God who has laid aside all false\ngods, and who calls on his brothers to do likewise. It is an act of faith,\nbecause it is the recognition that his brother CAN do it. It is a call to the\nHoly Spirit in his mind, a call to Him which is strengthened by this joining.\nBecause the miracle-worker has heard Him, he strengthens His Voice in a sick\nbrother by weakening his belief in sickness, which he does NOT share. The power\nof one mind CAN shine into another, because all the lamps of God were lit by the\nsame spark. It is everywhere, and it is eternal.\n\nIn many, only the spark remains, for the great rays are obscured. But\nGod has kept the spark alive, so the rays can never be completely forgotten. If\nyou but see the little spark, you will learn of the greater light, for the rays\nare there unseen. Perceiving the spark will heal, but knowing the Light will\ncreate.

    "content": "The Denial of God\n\nThe rituals of the god of sickness are strange and very demanding. Joy\nis never permitted, for depression is the sign of allegiance to him. Depression\nMEANS that you have foresworn God. Men are afraid of blasphemy, but they do not\nknow what it means. They do not realize that, to deny God, is to deny their own\nidentity, and in this sense, the wages of sin IS death. The sense is very\nliteral; -- denial of Life perceives its opposite, as ALL forms of denial replace\nwhat IS, with what is NOT. No-one can really DO this, but that you can THINK you\ncan, and BELIEVE YOU HAVE, is beyond dispute.\n\nDo not forget, however, that to deny God will inevitably result in\nprojection, and you will believe that others, AND NOT YOURSELF, have done this TO\nyou. You WILL receive the message you give, because it is the message you WANT.\nYou may believe that you judge your brothers by the messages they give YOU, but\nyou HAVE judged them by the message you give THEM. Do not attribute your denial\nof joy to them, or you cannot see the spark in them, that could bring joy to YOU.\nIt is the DENIAL of the spark that brings depression, and whenever you see your\nbrothers WITHOUT it, you ARE denying God.\n\nAllegiance to the denial of God is the ego's religion. The god of\nsickness obviously demands the denial of health, because health is in direct\nopposition to its own survival. But consider what this means to YOU. UNLESS you\nare sick you cannot keep the gods you made, for only in sickness could you\npossibly WANT them. Blasphemy, then, is SELF-destructive, not God destructive. It\nmeans that you are willing NOT to know yourself, IN ORDER to be sick. This IS the\noffering which your god demands, because having made him out of YOUR insanity, he\nIS an insane idea. He has many forms, but though he may seem like many different\nthings, he is but one idea;-- the denial of God.\n\nSickness and death entered the mind of God's Son against His Will. The\n“attack on God” made His Son think he was fatherless, and out of his\ndepression he made the god of depression. This was his alternative to joy,\nbecause he would not accept the fact that, although he was a creator, he had been\ncreated. Yet the Son IS helpless without the Father, Who alone IS his Help. We\nsaid before that of yourselves you can do nothing, but you are not OF yourselves.\nIf you were, what you have made would be true, and you could never escape.\n\nIt is BECAUSE you did not make yourselves, that you need be troubled\nby nothing. Your gods are nothing, because your Father did not create them. You\ncannot make creators who are unlike your Creator, any more than He could have\ncreated a Son who was unlike Him. If creation is sharing, it cannot create what\nis unlike itself. It can share only what it IS. Depression is isolation, and so\nit could not have BEEN created.\n\nSon of God, you have not sinned, but you have been much mistaken. But\nthis can be corrected, and God will help you, knowing that you could not sin\nagainst Him. You denied Him BECAUSE you loved Him, knowing that if you RECOGNIZED\nyour love for Him, you COULD not deny Him. Your denial therefore MEANS that you\nlove Him, and THAT YOU KNOW HE LOVES YOU. Remember that what you deny you MUST\nhave known. And if you can accept denial, YOU CAN ACCEPT ITS UNDOING.\n\nYour Father has not denied you. He does not retaliate, but He DOES\ncall to you to return. When you think He has not answered your call, YOU HAVE NOT\nANSWERED HIS. He calls to you from every part of the Sonship, because of His love\nfor His Son. If you hear His message, He HAS answered you, and you will learn\nwhat you are of Him, if you hear aright. The love of God is in everything He\ncreated, for His Son is everywhere. Look with peace upon your brothers, and God\nwill come rushing into your heart, in gratitude for your gift to Him.\n\nDo not look to the god of sickness for healing, but only to the God of\nlove, for healing is the acknowledgment of Him. When you acknowledge Him, you\nwill KNOW that He has never ceased to acknowledge you, and that in\nHis acknowledgment OF you lies your Being. You are not sick, and you cannot die.\nBut you CAN confuse your self with things that do. Remember, though, that to do\nthis IS blasphemy, for it means that you are looking without love on God and His\nCreation, from which He cannot be separated. Only the eternal can be loved, for\nlove does not die. What is of God is His forever, and you ARE of God. Would He\nallow Himself to suffer? And would He offer His Son anything that is not\nacceptable to Him?\n\nIf you will accept yourself as God created you, you will be incapable\nof suffering. But to do this, you must acknowledge Him as your Creator. This is\nnot because you will be punished otherwise. It is merely because your\nacknowledgment of your Father IS the acknowledgment of yourself as you ARE. Your\nFather created you Wholly without sin, wholly without pain, and wholly without\nsuffering of any kind. If you deny Him, you bring sin, pain, and suffering into\nyour OWN mind, because of the power He gave it. Your mind is capable of creating\nworlds, but it can also DENY what it creates, because it is free.\n\nYou do not realize how much you have denied yourself, and how much\nGod, in His love, would not have it so. Yet He would not interfere with you,\nbecause He would not know His Son if he were not free. To interfere with you\nwould be to attack HIMSELF, and God is not insane. When you denied HIM, you WERE\ninsane. Would you have Him SHARE your insanity? God will never cease to love His\nSon, and His Son will never cease to love Him. That was the condition of His\nSon's Creation, fixed forever in the Mind of God. To know that is sanity. To deny\nit is insanity. God gave HIMSELF to you in your Creation, and His gifts ARE\neternal. Would you deny yourself to Him?\n\nOut of your gifts to Him, the Kingdom will be restored to His Son. His\nSon removed himself from His gift by refusing to accept what had been created FOR\nhim, and what he himself had created in the name of His Father. Heaven waits for\nhis return, for it was created as the dwelling place of God's Son. You are not at\nhome anywhere else, or in any other condition. Do not deny yourself the joy which\nwas created FOR you, for the misery you have made for yourselves. God has given\nyou the means for undoing what you have made. Listen, and you WILL learn what you\nare.\n\nIf God knows His children as wholly sinless, it is blasphemous to\nperceive them as guilty. If God knows His children as wholly without pain, it is\nblasphemous to perceive suffering anywhere. If God knows his children to be\nwholly joyous, it is blasphemous to feel depressed. All these illusions, and the\nmany other forms which blasphemy may take, are REFUSALS TO ACCEPT CREATION AS IT\nIS. If God created His Son perfect, that is how you must learn to see him, to\nlearn of his reality. And as part of the Sonship, THAT IS HOW YOU MUST SEE\nYOURSELF TO LEARN YOURS.\n\nDo not perceive ANYTHING God did not create, or you ARE denying Him.\nHis is the ONLY Fatherhood, and it is yours only because HE has given it to you.\nYour gifts to YOURSELF are meaningless, but your gifts to YOUR creations are like\nHis, because they are given in His Name. That is why your creations are as real\nas His. But the real Fatherhood must be acknowledged, if the real Son is to be\nknown. You believe that the sick things which you have made are your real\ncreations, because you believe that the sick images you perceive are the Sons of\nGod.\n\nOnly if you ACCEPT the Fatherhood of God will you have anything,\nbecause His Fatherhood GAVE you everything. That is why to deny Him IS to deny\nyourself. Arrogance is the denial of love, because love shares and arrogance\nwithholds. As long as both appear to you to be desirable, the concept of choice,\nwhich is not of God, will remain with you. While this is not true in Eternity, it\nIS true in time, so that, while time lasts in YOUR minds, there WILL be choices.\nTime itself WAS your choice. If you would remember Eternity, you must learn to\nlook on only the Eternal. If you allow yourselves to become preoccupied with the\ntemporal, you are LIVING IN TIME. As always, your choice is determined by what",

The closer you come to the foundation of\nthe ego's thought system, the darker and more obscure becomes the way. But even\nthe little spark in your mind is enough to lighten it. Bring this light\nfearlessly with you, and hold it up to the foundation of the ego's thought system\nbravely. Be willing to judge it with perfect honesty.

Not one stone you place upon it but will\nbe blessed by Him. For you will be restoring the holy dwelling place of His Son,\nwhere He wills His Son to be, and where he IS. In whatever part of the mind of\nGod's Son you restore this reality, you restore it to YOURSELF. For you dwell in\nthe Mind of God WITH your brother, for God Himself did not will to be alone.\n\nTo be alone is to be separated from INFINITY, but how can this be, if\nINFINITY has no end? No-one can BE beyond the limitless, because what has NO\nlimits, must be everywhere. There are no beginnings and no endings in God, Whose\nUniverse is Himself. Can you exclude yourself from the Universe, or from God, Who\nIS the Universe? I and my Father are one with YOU, for you are part of us. Do you\nREALLY believe that part of God can be missing or lost to Him?\n\nIf you were not part of God, His Will would not be unified. Is this\nconceivable? Can part of His Mind contain nothing? If your place in His Mind\ncannot be filled by anyone EXCEPT you, and your filling it WAS your creation,\nWITHOUT you, there would be an empty place in God's Mind. Extension cannot be\nblocked, and it has no voids. It continues forever, however much it is denied.\nYour DENIAL of its reality arrests it in time, but not in Eternity. That is why\nyour creations have not ceased to be extended, and why so much is waiting for\nyour return.\n\nWaiting is possible ONLY in time, but time has no meaning. You who\nmade delay can leave time behind, simply by recognizing that neither beginnings\nnor endings were created by the Eternal, Who placed no limits on His creation nor\nupon those who create like Him. You do not know this, simply because you have\ntried to limit what HE created, and so you believe that ALL creation is limited.\nHow, then, could you know YOUR creations, having DENIED Infinity? The laws of the\nuniverse do not permit contradiction. What holds for God holds for you. If you\nbelieve YOU are absent from God, you WILL believe He is absent from you.\n\nInfinity is meaningless WITHOUT you, and YOU are meaningless without\nGod. There IS no end to God and His Son, for we ARE the universe. God is not\nincomplete, and He is not childless. Because He did not will to be alone, He\ncreated a Son like Himself. Do not deny Him His Son, for your unwillingness to\naccept His Fatherhood has denied you yours. See His creations as HIS Son, for\nyours were created in honor of Him.\n\nThe universe of love does not stop because you do not see it, and your\nclosed eyes have not lost the ability to see. Look upon the glory of His\ncreation, and you will learn what God has kept for YOU. God has given you a place\nin His Mind which is yours forever. But you could keep it only by Giving it, as\nit was given to you. Could YOU be alone there, if it was given you because GOD\ndid not will to be alone? God's Mind cannot be lessened. It can ONLY be\nincreased, and EVERYTHING He creates has the function of creating. It can ONLY be\nincreased, and EVERYTHING He creates has the function of creating. LOVE DOES NOT\nLIMIT, and what it creates is not limited.\n\nTo give without limit is God's Will for you, because only this can\nbring you the joy which is His, and which He wills to share with YOU. Your love\nis as boundless as His because it IS His. Could any part of Him be WITHOUT His\nLove, and could any part of His Love be contained? God is your heritage, because\nHis one gift is Himself. How can you give except LIKE Him, if you would know His\ngift to YOU? Give, then, without limit and without end, to learn how much HE has\ngiven YOU. Your ability to ACCEPT Him depends on your willingness to give as He\ngives. Your fatherhood and your Father are One.\nAugust , 1966.\n\nGod willed to create, and your will is His. It follows, then, that YOU\nwill to create, since your will follows from His. And being the extension of His\nwill, yours MUST be the same. Yet what you will, you do not know. This is not\nstrange, when you realize that to deny IS to not know. God's Will was that you\nare His Son. By DENYING this, you denied your OWN will, and therefore DO NOT KNOW\nWHAT IT IS. The reason you must ask what God's Will is in everything, is merely\nbecause It IS yours. YOU do not know what it is, but the Holy Spirit REMEMBERS IT\nFOR YOU.\n\nAsk him, therefore, what God's Will is for you, and He will tell you\nYOURS. It cannot be too often repeated that you do NOT KNOW it. Whenever what the\nHoly Spirit tells you appears to be coercive, it is ONLY because YOU DO NOT\nRECOGNIZE YOUR OWN WILL. The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God's\nWill is OUTSIDE yourself, and therefore NOT YOURS. In THIS interpretation, it IS\npossible for God's Will and yours to conflict. God, then, may seem to demand of\nyou what you do NOT want to give, and thus DEPRIVE you of what you want. Would\nGod, Who wants ONLY your will, be capable of this? Your will is His Life, which\nHe has GIVEN to you. Even in time you cannot live apart from Him, for sleep is\nnot death. What He created can sleep, but it CANNOT die. Immortality is His Will\nfor His Son, and His Son's will for HIMSELF. Yet God's Son cannot will death for\nhimself, because His Father is Life, and HIS SON IS LIKE HIM.\n\nCreation is your will because it is His. You cannot be happy unless\nyou do what you will truly, and you CHANGE this, because it is immutable. But it\nis immutable by God's Will AND YOURS, for otherwise His Will would not have been\nextended. You are afraid to know God's Will, because you believe it is NOT yours.\nThis belief is your whole sickness, and your whole fear. Every symptom of\nsickness and fear arises here, because this is the belief that makes you want\nnot to know. Believing this, you hide in darkness, denying that the Light is in YOU.\n\nYou are asked to trust the Holy Spirit only because He speaks for YOU.\nHe is the Voice for God, but never forget that God did not will to be alone. He\nSHARES His Will with you; He does not thrust it UPON you. Always remember that\nwhat He gives He holds, so that nothing He gives CAN contradict Him. You who\nshare His Life must share it to KNOW it, for sharing IS knowing. Blessed are you\nwho learn that to hear the Will of your Father, is to know your own. For it is\nYOUR will to be LIKE Him, Whose Will it is that it be so.\n\nGod's Will is that His Son be One, and united with Him in His Oneness.\nThat is why healing is the beginning of the recognition that YOUR WILL IS HIS.",

    "content": "The Willingness for Healing\n\nIf sickness is separation, the will to heal and BE HEALED is the first\nstep toward RECOGNIZING WHAT YOU TRULY WANT. Every ATTACK is a step AWAY from\nthis, and every healing thought brings it closer. The Son of God HAS both Father\nand Son because he IS both Father and Son.\n\nTo unite having and being is only to unite your will with His, for He\nwills you HIMSELF. And you will yourself to HIM, because in your perfect\nunderstanding of Him, you KNOW there IS but One Will. But when you attack ANY\npart of God and His Kingdom, your understanding is NOT perfect, and what YOU will\nis therefore lost to you.\n\nHealing thus becomes A LESSON IN UNDERSTANDING, and the more you\npractice it, the better teacher AND LEARNER you become. If you have DENIED truth,\nwhat better witnesses to its reality could you have, than those who have been\nhealed BY it? But be sure to count yourself among them, for in your willingness\nto JOIN them is YOUR healing accomplished.\n\nEvery miracle which you accomplish speaks to you of the Fatherhood of\nGod. Every healing thought which you ACCEPT, either FROM your brother or in your\nOWN mind, teaches you that you are God's Son. But in every hurtful thought you\nhold, wherever you perceive it, lies the denial of God's Fatherhood and your\nSonship. And denial IS as total as love. You cannot deny PART of yourself, simply\nbecause the remainder will seem to be unintegrated, and therefore without\nmeaning. And being without meaning TO YOU, you will not understand it.\nTo deny meaning MUST be to fail to understand.\n\nYou can only heal yourself, for only God's Son NEEDS healing. He needs\nit because he does not understand himself, and therefore knows not what he does.\nHaving forgotten his will, he does not know what he WANTS. Healing is a sign that\nHE WANTS TO MAKE WHOLE. And this willingness opens his OWN ears to the Voice of\nthe Holy Spirit, Whose message IS wholeness. He will enable you to go far beyond\nthe healing YOU would undertake, for beside your small willingness to make whole\nHe will lay His Own COMPLETE Will and make YOURS whole. What can the Son of God\nNOT accomplish with the Fatherhood of God in him?\n\nAnd yet the invitation must come from you, for you have surely learned\nthat whom you invite as your guest WILL abide with you. The Holy Spirit cannot\nspeak to an unwelcoming host, BECAUSE HE WILL NOT BE HEARD. The Eternal Guest\nremains, but His Voice grows faint in alien company. He needs your protection,\nbut only because your care is a sign that you WANT Him. Think like Him ever so\nslightly, and the little spark becomes a blazing light that fills your mind so\nthat He becomes your only Guest.\n\nWhenever you ask the ego to enter, you lessen His welcome. HE will\nremain, but YOU have allied yourself AGAINST Him. Whatever journey you choose to\ntake, He will go with you, waiting. You can safely trust His patience, for He\nCANNOT leave a part of God. But you will far more than patience. You will never\nrest until you know your function AND FULFILL IT, for only in this can your will\nand your Father's be wholly joined. To HAVE Him is to be LIKE Him, and He has\nGIVEN Himself to you.\n\nYou who have God MUST be as God, for HIS function became YOURS with\nHis gift. Invite this knowledge back into your minds, and let nothing that will\nobscure it enter. The Guest whom God sent you will teach you how to do this, if\nyou but recognize the little spark, and are WILLING TO LET IT GROW. YOUR\nwillingness need not be perfect, because His IS. If you will merely offer Him a\nlittle place, He will lighten it so much, that you will gladly extend it. And by\nTHIS extending, you will begin to remember Creation.\n\nWould you be hostage to the ego or host to God? You will accept only\nwhom YOU invite. You are free to determine who shall be your guest, and how long\nhe shall remain with you. But this is not REAL freedom, for it depends on how you\nsee it. For the Holy Spirit is THERE, although He cannot help you without your\ninvitation, and the ego is nothing, whether you invite it in or not. Real freedom",

    "content": "From Darkness to Light\n\nWhen you are weary, remember you have hurt yourself. Your Comforter\nwill rest you, but YOU cannot. YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW, for if you did, you could\nnever have grown weary. Unless you have hurt yourselves, you could never suffer\nin ANY way, for that is not God's Will for His Son. Pain is not of Him, for He\nknows no attack, and His peace surrounds you silently. God is very quiet, for\nthere is no conflict in Him. Conflict is the root of all evil, for being blind,\nit does not see whom it attacks. But it ALWAYS attacks the Son of God, and the\nSon of God is YOU.\n\nGod's Son is indeed in need of comfort, for he knows not what he does,\nbelieving his will is not his own. The Kingdom is his, and yet he wanders\nhomelessly. At home in God he is lonely, and amid all his brothers he is\nfriendless. Would God let this be real, if He did not will to be alone Himself?\nAnd if your will is His, it CANNOT be true of you, BECAUSE it is not true of Him.\nOh my children, if you knew what God wills for you, your joy would be complete!\nAnd what He wills HAS happened, for it was ALWAYS true.\n\nWhen the light comes, and you have said, “God's Will is mine,” you\nwill see such beauty that you will KNOW it is not of you. Out of your joy, you\nwill create beauty in His Name, for YOUR joy could no more be contained than His.\nThe bleak little world will vanish into nothingness, and your heart will be so\nfilled with joy that it will leap into Heaven and into the presence of God. I\ncannot tell you what this will be like, for your hearts are not ready. But I CAN\ntell you, and remind you often, that what God wills for Himself He wills for YOU,\nand what He wills for you IS yours.\n\nThe way is not hard, but it IS very different. Yours is the way of\npain, of which God knows nothing. THAT way is hard indeed, and very lonely. Fear\nand grief are your guests, and they go with you, and abide with you on the way.\nBut the dark journey is not the way of God's Son. Walk in light, and do not see\nthe dark companions, for they are not fit companions for the Son of God, who was\ncreated OF Light and IN Light.\nThe Great Light ALWAYS surrounds you, and shines out FROM you. How can you see\nthe dark companions in a Light such as this? If you see THEM, it is only because\nyou are denying the Light. But DENY THEM INSTEAD, for the Light is here, and the\nway is clear.\n\nGod hides nothing from His Son, even though he would hide himself. Yet\nthe Son of God cannot hide his glory, for God wills him to be glorious, and GAVE\nhim the Light that shines in him. You will never lose your way, for God leads\nyou. When you wander, you but undertake a journey which is not real. The dark\ncompanions, the dark way, are all illusions. Turn toward the Light, for the\nlittle spark in you is part of a Light so great that it can sweep you out of all\ndarkness forever. For your Father IS your Creator, and you ARE like Him. The\nChildren of Light cannot abide in darkness, for darkness is NOT in them.\n\nDo not be deceived by the dark comforters, and never let them enter\nthe mind of God's Son, for they have no place in His temple. When you are\ntempted to deny Him, remember that there ARE no other Gods that you CAN place\nbefore Him, and accept His Will for you in peace. For you CANNOT accept it\notherwise. Only God's Comforter CAN comfort you. In the quiet of His temple, He\nwaits to give you the peace that is yours. GIVE His peace that you may enter the\ntemple, and find it waiting for you. But be holy in the Presence of God, or you\nwill not know that you are there. For what is unlike God cannot enter His Mind,\nbecause it was not in His Thought, and therefore does not belong to Him. And YOUR\nminds must be as pure as His, if you would know what belongs to YOU.\n\nGuard carefully His temple, for He Himself dwells there, and abides in\npeace. You cannot enter God's Presence with the dark companions beside you, but\nyou also cannot enter alone. All your brothers must enter WITH you, for until you\nhave accepted them, YOU cannot enter. For you cannot understand Wholeness unless\nYOU are whole, and no part of the Son can be excluded, if he would know the\nwholeness of his Father.\n\nIn your mind you can ACCEPT the whole Sonship, and bless it with the\nlight your Father gave it. Then you will be worthy to dwell in the temple WITH\nHim, because it is YOUR will not to be alone. God blessed His Son forever. If you\nwill bless him in TIME, you will BE in eternity. Time cannot separate you from\nGod, if you use it on BEHALF of the eternal.",

    "content": "The Inheritance of God's Son\n\nNever forget that the Sonship is your salvation, for the Sonship is\nyour Soul. As God's Creation it is yours, and belonging to you, it is His. Your\nSoul does not need salvation, but your mind needs to learn what salvation IS. You\nare not saved FROM anything, but you ARE saved FOR glory. Glory is your\ninheritance, given your Soul by its Creator, that you might EXTEND it. But if you\nhate part of your own Soul, ALL your understanding is lost, because you are\nlooking on what God creates AS YOURSELF without love. And since what He created\nIS part of Him, you are denying Him His place in His own altar.\n\nCould you try to make God homeless, and know YOU are at home? Can the\nSon deny the Father, WITHOUT believing that the Father has denied HIM? God's laws\nhold ONLY for your protection, and they never hold in vain. What you experience,\nwhen you deny your father, is still for your protection, for the power of your\nwill cannot be lessened without the intervention of God AGAINST it, and any\nlimitation on YOUR power is NOT the Will of God. Therefore, look ONLY to the\npower that God gave you to save you, remembering that it is yours BECAUSE it is\nHis, and join with your brothers in His peace.\n\nThe peace of YOUR Soul lies in its limitlessness. Limit the peace you\nshare, and your own Soul MUST be unknown to you. Every altar to God is part of\nyour Soul, because the Light He created is One with Him. Would you cut a brother\noff from the Light that is yours? You could not do so, if you realized that YOU\nCAN ONLY DARKEN YOUR OWN MIND. As you bring HIM back, so will YOUR mind return.\nThat is the law of God, for the protection of the wholeness of His Son.\n\nONLY YOU CAN DEPRIVE YOURSELF OF ANYTHING. Do not oppose this\nrealization, for it is truly the beginning of the dawn of light. Remember also\nthat the denial of this simple fact takes many forms, and these you must learn to\nrecognize, and oppose steadfastly and WITHOUT EXCEPTION. This is a crucial step\nin the re-awakening. The beginning phases of this reversal are often quite\npainful, for as blame is withdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to\nharbor it within.\n\nIt is difficult, at first, to realize that this is EXACTLY\nthe same thing, for there IS no distinction between within and without. If your\nbrothers are part of YOU, and you blame THEM for your deprivation, you ARE\nblaming yourself. And you cannot blame yourself WITHOUT blaming them.\n\nThat is why blame must be UNDONE, NOT re-allocated. Lay it to\nyourself, and you cannot KNOW yourself, for ONLY THE EGO BLAMES AT ALL. Selfblame\nis therefore ego identification, and as strong an ego defense as blaming\nothers. YOU CANNOT ENTER GOD'S PRESENCE IF YOU ATTACK HIS SON. When His Son lifts\nhis voice in praise of his Creator, he WILL hear the Voice of his Father. But the\nCreator cannot be praised WITHOUT His Son, for their glory is shared, and they\nare glorified together. Christ is at God's altar, waiting to welcome His Son. But\ncome wholly without condemnation, for otherwise you will believe that the door is\nbarred, and you cannot enter.\n\nThe door is NOT barred, and it is impossible for you to be unable to\nenter the place where God would have you be. But love yourself with the love of\nChrist, for so does your Father love you. You CAN refuse to enter, but you CANNOT\nbar the door which Christ holds open. Come unto me who hold it open FOR you, for\nwhile I live, it cannot be shut, and I live forever. God is my Life and YOURS,\nand NOTHING is denied by God to His Son. At God's altar, Christ waits for the\nrestoration of Himself in YOU.\n\nGod knows His Son as wholly blameless as Himself, and He is approached\nthrough the appreciation of His Son. Christ waits for your acceptance of Him as\nYOURSELF, and His Wholeness as YOURS. For Christ is the Son of God, who lives in\nhis Creator, and shines with His glory. Christ is the extension of the love and\nthe loveliness of God, as perfect as his Creator, and at peace with Him.

    "content": "The “Dynamics” of the Ego\n\nNo-one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not\nlooking is the way they are PROTECTED. There is no need to shrink from illusions,\nfor they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's\nthought system, because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since\nyou realize you do not WANT it, you MUST be ready. Let us be very calm in doing\nthis, for we are merely looking honestly for truth. The “dynamics” of the ego\nwill be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to look beyond it,\nsince you HAVE made it real. We will UNDO this error quietly together, and then\nlook beyond it to truth.\n\nWhat is healing, but the removal of all that STANDS IN THE WAY of\nknowledge? And how else can one dispel illusions EXCEPT by looking at them\ndirectly, WITHOUT protecting them? Be not afraid, therefore, for what you will be\nlooking at IS the source of fear, but you have learned surely by now, that FEAR\nIS NOT REAL. We have accepted the fact already that its EFFECTS can be dispelled,\nmerely by denying THEIR reality. The next step is obviously to recognize that\nWHAT HAS NO EFFECTS DOES NOT EXIST.\n\nLaws do not operate in a vacuum, and what leads to nothing HAS NOT\nHAPPENED. If reality is recognized BY ITS EXTENSION, what extends to nothing\nCANNOT be real. Do not be afraid, then, to look upon fear, for it cannot BE seen.\nClarity undoes confusion by definition, and to look upon darkness through light\nMUST dispel it. Let us begin this lesson in “ego dynamics,” by understanding that\nthe term itself does not mean anything. In fact, it contains exactly the\ncontradiction in terms that MAKES it meaningless. “Dynamics” implies the power to\nDO something, and the whole separation fallacy lies in the belief that the ego\nHAS the power to do ANYTHING.\n\nThe ego is fearful BECAUSE you believe this. But the truth is very\nsimple; ALL POWER IS OF GOD. What is NOT of Him has no power to do ANYTHING. When\nwe look at the ego, then, we are NOT considering dynamics, but delusions. We can\nsurely regard a delusional system without fear,\nfor it cannot have any effects if its source is not true. Fear becomes more\nobviously inappropriate if one recognizes the ego's GOAL, which is so clearly\nsenseless that any effort exerted on its behalf is NECESSARILY expended on\nnothing.\n\nThe ego's goal is quite explicitly EGO AUTONOMY. From the beginning,\nthen, its PURPOSE is to be separate, sufficient unto itself, and independent of\nany power EXCEPT ITS OWN. This is WHY it is the symbol of separation. Every idea\nhas a purpose, and its purpose is always the natural extension of what it IS.\nEverything that stems from the ego is the natural outcome of its central belief,\nand the way to undo its RESULTS, is merely to recognize that their SOURCE is NOT\nnatural, being out of accord with your TRUE nature.\n\nWe once said that to will contrary to God is wishful thinking, and not\nreal willing. His Will is One, because the extension of His Will CANNOT be unlike\nITSELF. The real conflict you experience, then, is between the ego's idle wishes\nand the Will of God, WHICH YOU SHARE. Can this BE a real conflict? Yours is the\nindependence of Creation, NOT of autonomy. Your whole creative function lies in\nyour complete dependence on God, Whose function He shares WITH you. By HIS\nwillingness to share it, He becomes as dependent on you, as you are on HIM. Do\nnot ascribe the ego's arrogance to Him, Who wills NOT to be independent of YOU.\nHe has included YOU in HIS Autonomy. Can YOU believe that autonomy is meaningful\nAPART from Him?\n\nThe belief in EGO autonomy is costing you the knowledge of your\ndependence on God, IN WHICH YOUR FREEDOM LIES. The ego sees ALL dependency as\nthreatening, and has twisted even your longing for God into a means of\nestablishing ITSELF. But do not be deceived by ITS interpretation of your\nconflict. The ego ALWAYS attacks on behalf of separation. Believing it HAS the\npower to do this, it does nothing else, because its goal of autonomy\nIS nothing else. The ego is totally confused about reality, BUT IT DOES NOT LOSE\nSIGHT OF ITS GOAL. It is much more vigilant than YOU are, BECAUSE it is perfectly\ncertain of its purpose. YOU are confused, because you do NOT know YOURS.\n\nWhat you must learn to recognize is that the LAST thing the ego wishes\nyou to realize, is THAT YOU ARE AFRAID OF IT. For if the ego gives rise to fear,\nit is DIMINISHING your independence, and WEAKENING your power. Yet its one claim\nto your allegiance is that it can GIVE power to you. Without THIS belief, you\nwould not listen to it at all. How, then, can its existence continue, if you\nrealize that by accepting it, you ARE belittling yourself, and DEPRIVING yourself\nof power?\n\nThe ego can and does allow you to regard yourself as supercilious,\nunbelieving, “light hearted -,” distant, emotionally shallow, callous,\nuninvolved, and even desperate, BUT NOT REALLY AFRAID. MINIMIZING fear, but NOT\nits undoing, is the ego's constant effort, and is indeed the skill at which it is\nVERY ingenious. How can it preach separation WITHOUT upholding it through fear,\nand would you listen to it, if you recognized this IS what it is doing?\n\nYOUR recognition that whatever seems to separate you from God is ONLY\nfear, regardless of the form it takes, and quite apart from HOW THE EGO WANTS TO\nYOU TO EXPERIENCE IT, is therefore the basic ego threat. Its dream of autonomy is\nshaken to its foundation by this awareness. For though you may countenance a\nfalse idea of independence, you will NOT accept the cost of fear, IF YOU\nRECOGNIZE IT. Yet this IS the cost, and the ego CANNOT minimize it. For if you\noverlook love, you are overlooking YOURSELF, and you MUST fear UNreality BECAUSE\nYOU HAVE DENIED YOURSELF.\nBy believing that you have successfully attacked truth, YOU ARE BELIEVING THAT\nATTACK HAS POWER. Very simply, then, YOU HAVE BECOME AFRAID OF YOURSELF. And no\none wills to learn what he believes would DESTROY him.\n\nIf the ego's goal of autonomy COULD be accomplished GOD'S purpose\ncould be DEFEATED, and this IS impossible. Only by learning what fear IS, can you\nfinally learn to distinguish the possible from the impossible, and the false from\nthe true. According to the ego's teaching, ITS goal CAN be accomplished, and\nGOD'S Purpose can NOT. According to the Holy Spirit's teaching, ONLY God's\nPurpose IS accomplishment, and it is ALREADY accomplished.\n\nGod is as dependent on you as you are on Him, because HIS autonomy\nENCOMPASSES yours, and is therefore incomplete WITHOUT it. You can only ESTABLISH\nyour autonomy by identifying WITH Him, and FULFILLING YOUR FUNCTION AS IT EXISTS\nIN TRUTH. The ego believes that to accomplish ITS goal IS happiness. But it is\ngiven YOU to know that GOD'S function IS yours, and happiness CANNOT be found\napart from your joint will. Recognize only that the ego's goal, which you have\npursued quite diligently, has merely brought you FEAR, and it becomes difficult\nto maintain that FEAR is happiness.\n\nUPHELD by fear, this IS what the ego would have you believe. Yet God's\nSon is not insane, and CANNOT believe it. Let him but RECOGNIZE it, and he will\nNOT accept it. For only the insane would choose fear IN PLACE of love, and only\nthe insane could believe that love can be gained by ATTACK. But the sane KNOW\nthat only attack COULD produce fear, from which the love of God COMPLETELY\nprotects them.\n\nThe ego analyzes; the Holy Spirit ACCEPTS. The appreciation of\nwholeness comes ONLY through acceptance, for to analyze MEANS to separate out.\nThe attempt to understand totality by BREAKING IT UP is clearly the\ncharacteristically contradictory approach of the ego to everything. Never forget\nthat the ego believes that power, understanding AND TRUTH lie in separation. And\nto ESTABLISH this belief it MUST attack. Unaware that the belief cannot BE\nestablished, and obsessed with the conviction that separation IS salvation, the\nego attacks everything it perceives, by breaking it up into small and\ndisconnected parts, without meaningful relationships, and thus without meaning.\nThe ego will ALWAYS substitute chaos for meaning, for if separation is salvation,\nharmony is threat.\n\nThe ego's interpretations of the laws of perception are, and would\nHAVE to be, the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit's. The ego FOCUSES ON ERROR,\nand OVERLOOKS TRUTH. It makes real every mistake it perceives, and with\ncharacteristically circular reasoning, concludes that, BECAUSE of the mistake,\nconsistent truth must be meaningless. The next step, then, is obvious. If\nconsistent truth is meaningless, INCONSISTENCY must be true if truth has meaning.\nHolding error clearly in mind, and protecting what it has made real, the ego\nproceeds to the next step in its thought system; that error is real, and TRUTH IS\nERROR.\n\nThe ego makes no attempt to UNDERSTAND this, and it is clearly not\nunderstandable. But the ego does make EVERY attempt to DEMONSTRATE it, and THIS\nit does constantly. Analyzing to ATTACK meaning, the ego DOES succeed in\noverlooking it, and is left with a series of fragmented perceptions IN WHICH IT\nUNIFIES ON BEHALF OF ITSELF. This, then, becomes the universe it perceives and it\nis this universe which, in turn, becomes its demonstration of its own reality.\n\nDo not underestimate the appeal of the ego's demonstrations to those\nwho would listen. Selective perception chooses its witnesses carefully, and its\nwitnesses ARE consistent. The case for insanity IS strong to the insane. For\nreasoning ends at its beginning, and no thought system transcends its source. Yet\nreasoning without meaning CANNOT demonstrate anything, and those who are\nconvinced by it, MUST be deluded. Can the ego teach truly, when it overlooks\ntruth? Can it perceive what it has DENIED? Its witnesses DO attest to its DENIAL,\nbut hardly to WHAT it has denied. The ego looks straight at the Father and does\nnot see Him, for it has denied His Son.\n\nWould YOU remember the Father? Accept His Son and you WILL remember\nHim. Nothing can demonstrate that His Son is unworthy, for nothing can prove that\na lie is true. What you see of His Son through the eyes of the ego is a\ndemonstration that His Son does not exist, yet where the Son is, the Father MUST\nbe. Accept what God does NOT deny, and HE will demonstrate its truth. The\nwitnesses for God stand in His Light and behold what HE created. Their silence is\nthe sign that they have beheld God's Son, and in the Presence of Christ, THEY\nneed demonstrate nothing, for Christ speaks to them of Himself and of His Father.\nThey are silent because Christ speaks to them, and it is His words that THEY\nspeak.\n\nEvery brother you meet becomes a witness for Christ or for the ego,\ndepending on what you perceive in him. Everyone convinces you of WHAT YOU WANT TO\nPERCEIVE, and of the reality of the Kingdom you have chosen for your vigilance.\nEverything you perceive is a witness to the thought-system YOU WANT TO BE TRUE.\nEvery brother has the power to release you, IF YOU WILL TO BE FREE. You cannot",

    "content": "Experience and Perception\n\nIt is impossible not to believe what you see, but it is equally\nimpossible to see what you do NOT believe. Perceptions are built up on the basis\nof experience, and experience leads to beliefs. It is not until BELIEFS are fixed\nthat perceptions stabilize. In effect, then, what you believe you DO see. That is\nwhat I meant when I said, “Blessed are ye who have not seen and still believe,”\nfor those who believe in the resurrection WILL see it. The resurrection is the\ncomplete triumph of Christ over the ego, not by attack, but by transcendence. For\nChrist DOES rise above the ego and all its works, and ascends to the Father and\nHIS Kingdom.\n\nWould you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion? Would you\ncondemn your brothers or free them? Would you transcend YOUR prison and ascend to\nthe Father? For these questions are all the same, and are answered together.\nThere has been much confusion about what perception means, because the same word\nis used both for awareness and for the INTERPRETATION of awareness. Yet you\ncannot BE aware without interpretation, and what you perceive IS your\ninterpretation. This course is perfectly clear. You do not see it clearly because\nyou are interpreting AGAINST it, and therefore do not BELIEVE it. And if belief\ndetermines perception, you do NOT perceive what it means and therefore do not\nACCEPT it.\n\nYet different experiences lead to different beliefs, and with them\ndifferent perceptions. For perceptions are learned WITH beliefs, and experience\nteaches. I am leading you to a new kind of experience which you will become\nless and less willing to deny. Learning of Christ is easy, for to perceive with\nHim involves no strain at all. HIS perceptions are your NATURAL awareness, and it\nis only distortions which YOU introduce that tire you. Let the Christ in you\ninterpret FOR you, and do not try to limit what you see by narrow little beliefs\nwhich are unworthy of God's Son. For until Christ comes into His Own, the Son of\nGod WILL see himself as fatherless.\n\nI am YOUR resurrection and YOUR life. You live in me because you live\nin God. And everyone lives in YOU, as YOU live in everyone. Can you, then,\nperceive unworthiness in a brother and NOT perceive it in yourself? And can you\nperceive it in yourself and NOT perceive it in God? Believe in the resurrection\nbecause it has BEEN accomplished, and it has been accomplished IN YOU. This is as\ntrue now as it will ever be, for the resurrection is the Will of God, Which knows\nno time and no exceptions. But make no exceptions yourself, or you will not\nperceive what has been accomplished FOR you. For we ascend unto the Father\ntogether, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, for such is the\nnature of God's Son as His Father created him.\n\nDo not underestimate the power of the devotion of God's Son, nor the\npower of the god he worships over him. For he places HIMSELF at the altar of his\ngod, whether it be the god he made or the God Who created him. That is why his\nslavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will obey ONLY the god he accepts.\nThe god of the crucifixion demands that he crucify, and his worshippers obey. In\nhis name they crucify THEMSELVES, believing that the power of the Son of God is\nborn of sacrifice and pain. The God of the resurrection demands nothing, for He\ndoes not will to TAKE AWAY. He does not require obedience, for obedience implies\nsubmission. He would only have you learn your OWN will and follow it, not in the\nspirit of sacrifice and submission, but in the gladness of freedom.\n\nResurrection must compel your allegiance gladly because it is the\nsymbol of joy. Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it represents\nwhat YOU want to be. The freedom to leave behind everything that hurts you and\nhumbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon you, but it CAN be offered\nyou through the grace of God. And you can ACCEPT it by His grace, for God IS\ngracious to His Son, accepting him without question as His Own. Who, then, is\nYOUR own? The Father has given you all that is His, and He Himself is yours WITH\nthem. Guard them in their resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in God,\nsafely surrounded by what is yours forever.\n\nYou will not find peace until you have removed the nails from the\nhands of God's Son and taken the last thorn from his forehead. The Love of God\nsurrounds His Son whom the god of the crucifixion condemns. Teach not that I died\nin vain. Teach rather THAT I DID NOT DIE by demonstrating that I LIVE IN YOU. For\nthe UNDOING of the crucifixion of God's Son is the work of the redemption, in\nwhich everyone has a part of equal value. God does not judge His blameless Son.\nHaving given HIMSELF to him, how could it be otherwise?\n\nYou have nailed YOURSELF to a cross and placed a crown of thorns upon\nyour own head. Yet you CANNOT crucify God's Son, for the Will of God cannot die.\nHis Son HAS BEEN redeemed from his own crucifixion, and you cannot assign to\ndeath whom God has given eternal life. The dream of crucifixion still lies heavy\non your eyes, but what you see in dreams is not reality. While you perceive the\nSon of God as crucified you are asleep. And as long as you believe that YOU can\ncrucify him you are only having nightmares. You who are beginning to wake are\nstill aware of dreams and have not yet forgotten them.\n\nForgetting of dreams and the awareness of Christ comes with the\nawakening of others to SHARE your redemption. You will awaken to your own call,\nfor the Call to awake is WITHIN you. If I live in you, you ARE awake. But YOU\nmust see the works I do through you, or you will not perceive that I have done\nthem unto YOU. Do not set limits on what you believe I can do THROUGH YOU, or you\nwill not accept what I can do FOR you. For it is done ALREADY, and unless you\ngive ALL that you have received, you will not know that your Redeemer liveth\nand that YOU have awakened WITH Him. Redemption is recognized ONLY by sharing it.\n\nGod's Son IS saved. Bring only THIS awareness to the Sonship, and you\nwill have a part in the redemption as valuable as mine. For your part must be\nLIKE mine if you learn it of me. If you believe that YOURS is limited, YOU are\nlimiting MINE. There is no order of difficulty in miracles because all of God's\nSons are of equal value, and their equality is their Oneness. The whole power of\nGod is in every part of Him, and nothing contradictory to His Will is either\ngreat or small. What does not exist HAS no size and no measure. To God ALL things\nare possible. And to Christ it is given to be LIKE the Father.",

    "content": "The Problem and the Answer\n\nThe world as YOU perceive it cannot have been created by the Father,\nfor the world is NOT as you see it. God created ONLY the eternal, and everything\nYOU see is perishable. Therefore, there must be another world which you do NOT\nsee. The Bible speaks of a NEW Heaven and a NEW earth, yet this cannot be\nliterally true, for the eternal are not RE-created. To PERCEIVE anew is merely to\nperceive again, implying that before YOU WERE NOT PERCEIVING AT ALL. What, then,\nis the world that awaits your perception WHEN YOU SEE IT? Every loving thought\nthat the Son of God ever had is eternal. Those which his mind perceived in this\nworld are the world's only reality. They are still perceptions, because he still\nbelieves that he is separate, yet they are eternal, because they are loving. And\nBEING loving, they are like the Father, and therefore cannot die.\n\nThe real world can ACTUALLY BE PERCEIVED. All that is necessary is a\nwillingness to perceive nothing ELSE. For if you perceive both good AND evil, you\nare accepting both the false AND the true, AND MAKING NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN\nTHEM. The ego sees SOME good, but never ONLY good. That is WHY its perceptions\nare so variable. It does not reject goodness entirely, for this you could not\naccept, but it always ADDS something that is NOT real TO the real, thus CONFUSING\nILLUSION AND REALITY. For perceptions cannot be partly true. If you believe in\ntruth AND illusion you CANNOT TELL WHICH IS TRUE.\n\nTo establish your PERSONAL autonomy, you tried to create UNLIKE your\nFather, BELIEVING what you made to be capable of BEING unlike Him. Yet everything\nin what you have made that IS true, IS like Him. Only this is the real world, and\nperceiving ONLY this will lead you to the real Heaven because IT WILL MAKE YOU\nCAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING IT. The perception of goodness is not knowledge, but the\ndenial of the OPPOSITE of goodness enables you to perceive a condition in which\nopposites do not exist. And this IS the condition of knowledge. WITHOUT this\nawareness, you have NOT met its conditions, and until you do you will not know\nthat it is yours already.\n\nYou have made many ideas which you have placed between yourselves and\nyour Creator, and these beliefs are the world as YOU perceive it. Truth is not\nabsent here, but it IS obscure. You do not know the difference between what you\nhave made, and what God created, and so you do not know the difference between\nwhat you have made, and what YOU have created. To believe that you can perceive\nthe real world is to believe that you can know yourself. You CAN know God,\nbecause it is His Will to BE known. The real world is all that the Holy Spirit\nhas saved for you, out of what you have made, and to perceive only this is\nsalvation, because it is the recognition that reality is ONLY WHAT IS TRUE.\n\nThis is a very simple course. Perhaps you do not feel that a course\nwhich, in the end, teaches nothing more than that only reality is true is\nnecessary. BUT DO YOU BELIEVE IT? When you have perceived the real world, you\nwill recognize that you did NOT believe it. But the swiftness with which your new\nand ONLY real perception will be translated into knowledge, will leave you only\nan instant to realize that this judgment is true. And then everything you made\nwill be forgotten, the good and the bad, the false and the true. For as Heaven\nand earth become one, even the real world will vanish from your sight. The end of\nthe world is not its destruction, but its TRANSLATION into Heaven. The REINTERPRETATION\nof the world is the transfer of ALL perception to knowledge.\n\nThe Bible tells you to become as little children. Little children\nrecognize that they do not understand what they perceive, and so they ASK WHAT IT\nMEANS. Do not make the mistake of believing that YOU understand what YOU\nperceive, for its meaning IS lost to you. But the Holy Spirit has saved its\nmeaning FOR you, and if you will LET Him interpret it FOR you, He will restore\nwhat you have thrown away. As long as you THINK YOU KNOW its meaning, you will\nsee no need to ask it OF Him. You do not know the meaning of ANYTHING you\nperceive. NOT ONE THOUGHT YOU HOLD IS WHOLLY TRUE.\n\nThe recognition of this is your firm beginning. You are not misguided;\nyou have accepted no guide at all. Instruction in perception is your\ngreat need, FOR YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING. RECOGNIZE this, but do not accept it, for\nunderstanding is your inheritance. Perceptions are learned, and you are not\nwithout a Teacher. But your willingness to learn of Him depends on your\nwillingness to question EVERYTHING you have learned OF YOURSELF, for you who have\nlearned amiss should not be your own teachers. No-one can withhold truth, except\nfrom himself. Yet God will not refuse the answer He GAVE you. Ask, then, for what\nis yours, but which you did NOT make, and do not defend yourself AGAINST truth.\n\nYOU made the problem which God HAS answered. Ask yourselves,\ntherefore, but one simple question; “Do I want the problem or do I want the\nanswer?” Decide for the answer, and you WILL have it, for you will see it as it\nis, and it is yours already. You complain that this course is not sufficiently\nspecific for you to understand it AND USE IT. Yet it has been VERY specific, and\nYOU HAVE NOT DONE WHAT IT SPECIFICALLY ADVOCATES. This is not a course in the\nplay of ideas, but in their PRACTICAL APPLICATION. Nothing could be more specific\nthan to be told very clearly, that if you ask you WILL receive.\n\nThe Holy Spirit will answer EVERY specific problem, as long as you\nbelieve that problems ARE specific. His answer is both many and one, as long as\nyou believe that the One IS many. Realize that YOU ARE AFRAID OF HIS SPECIFICITY,\nfor fear of what you think it will DEMAND of you. Yet only by asking will you\nlearn that nothing that is of God demands ANYTHING of you. God GIVES; He does NOT\ntake. You are refusing to ask, because you believe that asking is TAKING, and you\ndo not perceive it as sharing. The Holy Spirit will give you only what is yours,\nand will take nothing in return. For what is yours IS everything, and you share\nit WITH God. This IS its reality. Would the Holy Spirit, Who wills only to\nRESTORE, be capable of MISinterpreting the question you must ask to learn His\nanswer?\n\nYou HAVE heard the answer, but you have misunderstood the QUESTION.\nYou have believed that to ask for guidance of the Holy Spirit, IS TO ASK FOR\nDEPRIVATION. Little children of God, you do not understand your Father.\nYou believe in a world that takes because you believe that you can get by taking.\nBut BY that perception, you have lost sight of the real world. You are afraid of\nthe world AS YOU SEE IT, but the real world is still yours for the asking. Do not\ndeny it TO yourself, for it can ONLY free you. Nothing of God will enslave His\nSon, whom He created free and whose freedom is protected by HIS Being.\n\nBlessed are you who will ask the truth of God without fear, for only\nthus can you learn that His answer IS the release from fear. Beautiful Child of\nGod, you are asking only for what I promised you. Do you believe I would DECEIVE\nyou? The Kingdom of Heaven IS within you. Believe that the truth is in me, for I\nKNOW that it is in YOU. God's Sons have nothing which they do not share. Ask for\ntruth of any Son of God, and you have asked it of me. No one of us but has the\nanswer in him, to give to anyone who asks it OF him. Ask anything of God's Son,\nand His Father will answer you, for Christ is not deceived in His Father and His\nFather is not deceived in Him.\n\nDo not, then, be deceived in your brother, and see only his loving\nthoughts as his reality, for by denying that his mind is split, YOU WILL HEAL\nYOURS. Accept him as his Father accepts him, and heal him unto Christ, for Christ\nis his healing AND YOURS. Christ is the Son of God Who is in no way separate from\nHis Father, Whose EVERY thought is as loving as the Thought of His Father, by\nwhich He was created. Be not deceived in God's Son, for thereby you MUST be\ndeceived in yourself. And being deceived in yourself you ARE deceived in your\nFather, in Whom no deceit is possible.\n\nIn the real world, there is no sickness, for there is no separation\nand no division. Only loving thoughts are recognized, and because no-one is\nwithout YOUR help, the Help of God goes with YOU everywhere. As you become\nwilling to ACCEPT this Help BY ASKING FOR IT, you will give it BECAUSE YOU WANT\nIT. Nothing will be beyond your healing power, because nothing will be denied\nyour simple request. What problems will not disappear in the presence\nof God's answer? Ask, then, to learn of the reality of your brother BECAUSE THIS\nIS WHAT YOU WILL PERCEIVE IN HIM, and you will see YOUR beauty reflected in HIM.\n\nDo not accept your brother's variable perception of himself, for his\nsplit mind is yours, and you will not accept YOUR healing without his. For you\nshare the real world as you share Heaven, and his healing IS yours. To love\nyourself is to HEAL yourself, and you cannot perceive part of you as sick and\nachieve your OWN goal. Brother, we heal together as we live together, and love\ntogether. Be not deceived in God's Son, for he is one with himself, and One with\nhis Father. Love him who is beloved of His Father, and you will learn of the\nFather's Love for YOU.\n\nIf you perceive offense in a brother, pluck the offense from your\nmind, for you are offended by Christ, and are deceived in Him. HEAL in Christ and\nbe not offended by Him, for there is no offense IN Him. If what you perceive\noffends you, you are offended in YOURSELF, and are condemning God's Son, whom God\ncondemneth not. Let the Holy Spirit remove ALL offense of God's Son against\nhimself and perceive no-one but through HIS guidance, for He would save you from\nALL condemnation. Accept His healing power, and use it for all He sends you, for\nHe wills to heal the Son of God in whom He is not deceived.\n\nChildren perceive terrifying ghosts and monsters and dragons, and they\nare terrified. But if they ask someone they trust for the REAL meaning of what\nthey perceive, and are willing to LET THEIR INTERPRETATIONS GO IN FAVOR OF\nREALITY, their fear goes with them. When a child is helped to translate his\n“ghost” into a curtain, his “monster” into a shadow and his “dragon” into a\ndream, he is no longer afraid, and laughs happily at his own fear. You, my\nchildren, are afraid of your brothers, and of your Father and of YOURSELVES. But\nyou are merely DECEIVED in them.\n\nAsk what they ARE of the Teacher of Reality, and hearing His answer,\nyou too will laugh at your fears and replace them with peace. For fear lies\nnot in reality, but in the minds of children who do not UNDERSTAND it. It is only\ntheir LACK OF UNDERSTANDING that frightens them, and when they learn to perceive\ntruly, they are not afraid. And because of this, they will ask for truth again,\nwhen they are frightened. It is not the REALITY of your brothers, or your Father,\nor yourself which frightens you. You do not know what they ARE, and so YOU\nperceive them as ghosts and monsters and dragons.\n\nASK of their reality from the One Who knows it, and He will tell you\nwhat they are. For you do NOT understand them, and because you are deceived by\nwhat you see, you NEED reality to dispel your fears. Would you not exchange your\nfears for truth if the exchange is yours for the asking? For if God is not\ndeceived in you, you can be deceived only in YOURSELF. But you can learn the\ntruth of yourself of the Holy Spirit, Who will teach you that, as part of God,\ndeceit in YOU is impossible. When you perceive yourself without deceit, you will",

    "content": "The Judgment of the Holy Spirit\n\nThere is but one interpretation of ALL motivation that makes any\nsense, and, because it is the Holy Spirit's judgment, it requires no effort at\nall on your part. Every loving thought is true. EVERYTHING ELSE is an appeal for\nhealing and help. That is what it IS, regardless of the form it takes. Can anyone\nbe justified in responding with anger to a plea for help? No response can BE\nappropriate EXCEPT the willingness to give it TO him, for this and ONLY this is\nwhat he is ASKING for. Offer him anything ELSE, and YOU are assuming the right to\nattack his reality, by interpreting it AS YOU SEE FIT.\n\nPerhaps the danger of this to your OWN mind is not yet fully apparent.\nBut this by no means signifies that it is not perfectly clear. If you maintain\nthat an appeal for help is something ELSE, you will REACT to something else, and\nyour response will be inappropriate to reality as IT is, but NOT to your\nperception OF it. This is poor reality testing by definition. There is nothing to\nprevent you from recognizing ALL calls for help as exactly what they are, EXCEPT\nYOUR OWN PERCEIVED NEED TO ATTACK. It is only THIS that makes you willing to\nengage in endless “battles” with reality, in which you DENY the reality of the\nneed for healing by making IT unreal.\n\nYou would not do this except for your UNWILLINGNESS to perceive\nreality, WHICH YOU WITHHOLD FROM YOURSELF. It is surely good advice to tell you\nnot to judge what you do not understand. No-one with a personal investment is a\nreliable witness, for truth for him has become what he WANTS it to be. If you are\nunwilling to perceive an appeal for help AS WHAT IT IS, it is because YOU are\nunwilling to give help, AND RECEIVE IT. The analysis of the ego's “real”\nmotivation is the modern equivalent of the inquisition. For in both, a brother's\nerrors are “uncovered,” and he is then attacked FOR HIS OWN GOOD. What can this\nbe, BUT projection? For HIS errors lay in the minds of his INTERPRETERS, for\nwhich they punished HIM.\n\nWhenever you fail to recognize a call for help, you are REFUSING help.\nWould you maintain that you do not NEED it? Yet this IS what you are maintaining\nwhen you refuse to recognize a brother's appeal. For only by ANSWERING his\nappeal, can YOU be helped. Deny him YOUR help, and you will NOT perceive God's\nanswer to YOU. The Holy Spirit does NOT need your help in interpreting\nmotivation, but you DO need HIS. ONLY appreciation is an appropriate response to\nyour brother. Gratitude is due him for both his loving thoughts, and his appeals\nfor help, for both are capable of bringing love into YOUR awareness, IF YOU\nPERCEIVE THEM TRULY. And ALL your sense of strain comes from your attempts NOT to\ndo just this.\n\nHow simple, then, is God's plan for salvation. There is but one\nresponse to reality, for reality evokes no conflict at all. There is but one\nTeacher of Reality, Who understands what it is. He does NOT change His mind about\nreality, because REALITY does not change. Although YOUR\ninterpretations of reality are meaningless in your divided state, His remain\nconsistently true. He GIVES them to you because they are FOR you.\n\nDo not attempt to “help” a brother in YOUR way, for you cannot help\nYOURSELVES. But hear his call for the help of God, and you will recognize your\nOWN need for the Father. Your interpretations of your brother's need is your\ninterpretation of YOURS. By giving help, you are ASKING FOR IT. And if you\nperceive but one need in yourself, you WILL be healed. For you will recognize\nGod's answer as you want it to be, and if you want it in truth, it will be truly\nyours. Every appeal you answer in the Name of Christ, brings the remembrance of\nyour Father closer to YOUR awareness. For the sake of YOUR need, then, hear every\ncall for help as what it is, so God can answer YOU.\n\nBy applying the Holy Spirit's interpretation of the reactions of\nothers more and more consistently, you will gain an increasing awareness that HIS\ncriteria are equally applicable to YOU. For to RECOGNIZE fear is not enough to\nescape FROM it, although the recognition IS necessary to demonstrate the NEED for\nescape. The Holy Spirit must still TRANSLATE it into truth. If you were LEFT with\nthe fear, having RECOGNIZED it, you would have taken a step AWAY from reality,\nnot TOWARDS it. Yet we have repeatedly emphasized the need to recognize fear, and\nface it WITHOUT DISGUISE, as a crucial step in the undoing of the ego. Consider\nhow well the Holy Spirit's interpretation of the motives of others will serve you\nthen.\n\nHaving taught you to accept only loving thoughts in others, and to\nregard everything else as an appeal for help, He has taught you that FEAR is an\nappeal for help. This is what RECOGNIZING it really means. If you do NOT PROTECT\nit, HE will re-interpret it. That is the ultimate value TO YOU in learning to\nperceive attack as a call for love. We have learned surely that fear and attack\nare inevitably associated. If ONLY attack produces fear, and if you see attack as\nthe call for help that it IS, the REALITY of fear MUST dawn upon you. For fear IS\na call for love, in unconscious recognition of what has been denied.",

    "content": "The Mechanism of Miracles\n\nFear is a symptom of your deep sense of loss. If, when you perceive it\nin others, you learn to SUPPLY the loss, the basic CAUSE of fear is removed.\nThereby you teach yourself that fear does not exist IN YOU, for you have in\nYOURSELF, the means for removing it, and have DEMONSTRATED this by GIVING it.\nFear and love are the only emotions of which you are capable. One is false, for\nit was made out of denial, and denial DEPENDS on the real belief in what is\ndenied for its OWN existence.\n\nBy interpreting fear correctly, as a POSITIVE AFFIRMATION OF THE\nUNDERLYING BELIEF IT MASKS, you are undermining its perceived usefullness by\nrendering it useless. Defenses which do not work AT ALL are AUTOMATICALLY\ndiscarded. If you raise what fear conceals to CLEAR-CUT, UNEQUIVOCAL PREDOMINANCE,\nfear becomes meaningless. You have denied its power to conceal love,\nwhich was its only purpose. The mask which YOU have drawn across the face of Love\nhas disappeared.\n\nIf you would look upon Love, which IS the world's reality, how could\nyou do better than to recognize, in every defense AGAINST it, the underlying\nappeal FOR it? And how could you better learn of its reality, than by answering\nthe appeal for it by GIVING it? The Holy Spirit's interpretation of fear DOES\ndispel it, for the AWARENESS of truth cannot BE denied. Thus does the Holy Spirit\nreplace fear with love, and translate error into truth. And thus will YOU learn\nof Him how to replace your dream of separation with the fact of unity. For the\nseparation is only the DENIAL of union, and, correctly interpreted, attests to\nyour eternal knowledge that union is true.\n\nMiracles are merely the translation of denial into truth. If to love\noneself is to HEAL oneself, those who are sick do NOT love themselves. Therefore,\nthey are asking for the love that would heal them, but which they are DENYING TO\nTHEMSELVES. If they knew the truth about themselves, they could not be sick. The\ntask of the miracle-worker thus becomes to DENY THE DENIAL OF TRUTH. The sick\nmust heal THEMSELVES, for the truth is IN them. But, having OBSCURED it, the\nlight in ANOTHER mind must shine into theirs, because that light IS theirs.\n\nThe light in them shines as brightly, REGARDLESS of the density of the\nfog that obscures it. If you give no power to the fog to obscure the light, it\nHAS none, for it has power ONLY because the Son of God gave power TO it. He must\nHIMSELF withdraw that power, remembering that all power is of God. YOU CAN\nREMEMBER THIS FOR ALL THE SONSHIP. Do not allow your brother not to remember, for\nhis forgetfullness is YOURS. But YOUR remembering is HIS, for God cannot be\nremembered alone. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN. To perceive the healing of\nyour brother as the healing of yourself, is thus the way to remember God. For you\nforgot your brothers WITH Him, and God's answer to your forgetting is but the way\nto remember.\n\nPerceive in sickness but another call for love, and offer your brother\nwhat he believes he cannot offer HIMSELF. Whatever the sickness, there is but one\nremedy. You will be made whole as you MAKE whole, for to perceive in sickness the\nappeal for health, is to recognize in hatred the call for love. And to give a\nbrother what he REALLY wants, is to offer it unto yourself. For your Father wills\nyou to know your brother AS yourself. Answer HIS call for love, and YOURS is\nanswered. Healing is the love of Christ for His Father, and for HIMSELF.\nSept. , 66\n\nYou have no idea of the intensity of your wish to get rid of each\nother. This does NOT mean that you are not strongly impelled TOWARD each other,\nbut it DOES mean that LOVE IS NOT THE ONLY EMOTION. Because your love has become\nmore in awareness, the conflict can no longer be “settled” by your previous\nattempts to MINIMIZE the fear. The love makes attack untenable, BUT YOU STILL\nFEEL THE FEAR. Instead of trying to resolve it directly, you have a strong\ntendency to TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE LOVE. Yet this is the LAST thing you would\nwant to ESCAPE from. And even if you did, you can escape from everything ELSE,\nbut not from this. Be glad indeed that there IS no escape from salvation.\n\nYou do not realize how much you hate each other. You will not get rid\nof this until you DO realize it, for UNTIL then, you will think you want to get\nrid of EACH OTHER and KEEP THE HATRED. Yet if you are each other's salvation,\nwhat can this mean except that you PREFER attack to salvation? Be glad that\nneither your reality nor your salvation is a matter of your preference, for you\nHAVE much cause for joy. But that the cause is NOT of your making is surely\nobvious. You DO hate and fear each other, and your love, which is very real, is\nTOTALLY obscured by it. How can you know the meaning of love UNLESS it is total?\n\nThis will be a very difficult period for you, but it will not be so\nfor long. You are in danger, but you WILL be helped, and nothing will happen.\nBut you cannot remain in darkness, and this will BE the way out. Look as calmly\nas you can upon hatred, for if we are to deny the denial of truth, we must first\nRECOGNIZE what we are denying. Remember that knowledge PRECEDES denial, and that\nthe separation was a descent from magnitude to littleness. And so the way back\nis to retrace the way to magnitude.\n\nYour hatred is not real, But it is real to you. IT HIDES WHAT YOU\nREALLY WANT. Surely you are willing to look upon what you do NOT want without\nfear, EVEN IF IT FRIGHTENS YOU, if you can thereby get rid of it? For you CANNOT\nescape salvation, and you WILL not escape fear until you WANT salvation. Be not\nafraid of this journey into fear, for it is not your destination. And we will\nwalk through it in safety, for peace is not far, and you will be led in its\nlight.\n\nRemember what we said about the frightening perceptions of little\nchildren, which terrify them because they do not understand them. If they ASK for\nenlightenment, AND ACCEPT IT, their fears vanish. But if they HIDE their\nnightmares, they will KEEP them. It is easy to help an uncertain child, for he\nrecognizes that he does not know what his perceptions mean. But you believe you\nDO know. Little children, you are hiding your heads under the covers of the heavy\nblankets you have laid upon yourselves. You are hiding your nightmares in the\ndarkness of your own certainty, and refusing to open your eyes and LOOK AT THEM.\n\nLet us not save nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for\nChrist, and so they are not fit gifts for YOU. Take off the covers, and look at\nwhat you are afraid of. Only the ANTICIPATION will frighten you, for the reality\nof nothingness cannot be frightening. Let us not delay this, for your dream of\nhatred will not leave you without help, and help is here. Learn to be quiet in\nthe midst of turmoil, for quietness is the END of strife, and this is the journey\nto peace. Look straight at every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is\ninevitable, because it is eternal.\n\nThe goal of love is but your right, and it belongs to you DESPITE your\npreference. YOU STILL WILL WHAT GOD WILLS, and no nightmare can defeat a Child of\nGod in his purpose. For your purpose was given you by God, and you must\naccomplish it, BECAUSE it is His Will. Awake and remember your purpose, for it is\nYOUR will to do so. What has been accomplished FOR you MUST be yours. Do not let\nyour hatred stand in the way of love, for NOTHING can withstand the love of\nChrist for His Father, or His Father's love for Him.\n\nA little while, and you WILL see me. For I am not hidden because you\nare hiding. I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for I awoke FOR\nyou. In MY Resurrection is YOUR release. Our mission is to ESCAPE CRUCIFIXION;\nnot Redemption. Trust in my help, for I did not walk alone, and I will walk with\nyou, as our Father walked with me. Did you not know that I walked with Him in\npeace? And does not that mean that peace goes with US on the journey?\n\nThere is no fear in perfect love. We will but be making perfect TO\nyou, what is ALREADY perfect IN you. You do not fear the UNKNOWN, but the KNOWN.\nYou will not fail in your mission, because I failed not in mine. Give me but a\nlittle trust, in the name of the COMPLETE trust I have in you, and we will easily\naccomplish the goal of perfection together. For perfection IS, and cannot be\ndenied. To deny the denial of perfection is not so difficult as the denial of\ntruth. And what we can accomplish together MUST be believed, when you SEE it as\naccomplished. You who have tried to banish love have not succeeded. But you who\nchoose to banish fear WILL succeed.\n\nThe Lord is with you, but you know it not. Yet your Redeemer\nliveth, and abideth in you in the peace out of which He was created. Would you\nnot exchange THIS awareness for the awareness of your fear? When we have OVERCOME\nfear, not by hiding it, not by minimizing it, not by denying its full import in\nANY way, THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL REALLY SEE. You cannot lay aside the obstacle to\nreal vision without looking upon it, for to lay aside means to judge AGAINST. If\nYOU will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, AND WILL JUDGE TRULY. He cannot shine\naway what YOU keep hidden, for you have not offered it TO Him, and He CANNOT take\nit FROM you.\n\nWe therefore are embarking on an organized, well-structured, and\ncarefully planned program, aimed at learning how to offer to the Holy Spirit\neverything you do NOT want. HE knows what to DO with it. You do NOT know how to\nuse what He knows. Whatever is revealed to Him that is not of God, is gone. But\nyou must reveal it to YOURSELF in perfect willingness, for otherwise His\nknowledge remains useless TO you. Surely He will not fail to help you, since help\nis His ONLY purpose. Do you not have greater reason for fearing the world, as you\nperceive it, than for looking at the cause of fear, and letting it go forever?",

    "content": "The Investment in Reality\n\nI once asked if you were willing to sell all you have, and give to\nthe poor and follow me. This is what I meant: If you had no investment in\nanything in this world, you could teach the poor where THEIR treasure IS. The\npoor are merely those who have invested wrongly, and they are poor indeed! And\nbecause they are in need, it is given to you to help them, since you are among\nthem. Consider how perfectly your lesson would be learned, IF YOU WERE UNWILLING\nTO SHARE THEIR POVERTY. For poverty is lack, and there is but one lack, since\nthere is but one need.\n\nSuppose a brother insists on having you do something you think you do\nnot want to do. The very fact of his insistence should tell you that HE\nBELIEVES SALVATION LIES IN IT. If you insist on refusing, and experience a quick\nresponse of opposition, YOU are believing that YOUR salvation lies in NOT doing\nit. You, then, are making the same mistake that HE is, and are making his error\nreal to both of you. Insistence means INVESTMENT, and what you invest in is\nALWAYS related to your notion of salvation. The question is always two-fold;\nfirst, WHAT is to be saved, and second, how can it BE saved?\n\nWhenever you become angry with a brother, for WHATEVER reason, you\nare believing that the EGO is to be saved, AND TO BE SAVED BY ATTACK. If HE\nattacks, you are agreeing with this belief, and if YOU attack, you are\nreinforcing it. REMEMBER THAT THOSE WHO ATTACK ARE POOR. Their poverty asks for\ngifts, NOT for further impoverishment. You who could help them are surely acting\ndestructively, if you accept their poverty AS YOURS. If you had not invested AS\nTHEY HAD, it would never occur to you to overlook their need.\n\nRECOGNIZE WHAT DOES NOT MATTER, and if your brothers ask you for\nsomething “outrageous,” do it BECAUSE it does not matter. Refuse, and your\nOPPOSITION establishes that it DOES matter to you. It is only you, therefore, who\nhave MADE the request outrageous, for nothing can BE asked OF you, and EVERY\nrequest of a brother is FOR you. Why would you insist in DENYING him? For to do\nso is to deny yourself, and impoverish both. HE is asking for salvation, as YOU\nare. Poverty is of the ego, and never of God. No “outrageous” request CAN be made\nof one who recognizes what is valuable, and wants to accept nothing else.\n\nSalvation is for the mind, and it is attained through peace. This is\nthe only thing that CAN be saved, and the ONLY way to save it. Any response OTHER\nthan love, arises from a confusion about the “what” and the “how” of salvation.\nAnd this is the ONLY answer. Never lose sight of this, and never allow yourself\nto believe, even for an instant, that there is another answer. For you will\nsurely place yourself among the poor, who do not understand that they dwell in\nabundance and that salvation is come.\n\n\nTo identify with the ego is to attack yourself, and MAKE YOURSELF\nPOOR. That is why everyone who identifies with the ego FEELS DEPRIVED. What he\nEXPERIENCES is then depression or anger, but what he DID is to exchange his selflove\nfor self-hate, MAKING HIM AFRAID OF HIMSELF. He does NOT realize this. Even\nif he is fully aware of ANXIETY, he does NOT perceive its source AS HIS OWN EGO\nIDENTIFICATION, and he ALWAYS tries to handle it by making some sort of insane\n“arrangement” with the world. He ALWAYS perceives this world as OUTSIDE HIMSELF,\nfor this is crucial to his adjustment. He does NOT realize that HE MAKES THIS\nWORLD, for there IS no world outside him.\n\nIf only the loving thoughts of God's Son ARE the world's reality, the\nreal world MUST be IN HIS MIND. His insane thoughts, too, must be in his mind,\nbut an INTERNAL conflict of this magnitude he cannot tolerate. For a split mind\nIS endangered, and the recognition that it encompasses COMPLETELY opposed\nthoughts within itself IS intolerable. Therefore, the mind projects the split,\nNOT the reality. EVERYTHING you perceive as the outside world, is merely your\nattempt to maintain your ego identification, for everyone believes that\nidentification is salvation.\n\nBut consider what has happened, for thoughts have consequences to the\nthinker. You are AT ODDS with the world as you perceive it because you think IT\nis antagonistic to you. THIS IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.\nYou have projected outward what IS antagonistic to what is inward, and therefore\nyou would HAVE to perceive it this way. That is why you MUST realize that your\nhatred IS in your mind, and NOT OUTSIDE IT, before you can get rid of it. And why\nyou MUST get rid of it, BEFORE you can perceive the world as it really is.\n\nLong ago we said that God so loved the world that He gave it TO His\nonly-begotten Son. (that whosoever believeth on him should never see death). God\nDOES love the real world, and those who perceive its reality\nCANNOT see the world of death. For death is not OF the real world, in which\neverything is eternal. God gave you the real world in exchange for the one you\nmade, out of your split mind, and which IS the symbol of death. For if you could\nREALLY separate yourselves from the Mind of God, you WOULD die. And the world you\nperceive IS a world of separation.\n\nYou were willing to accept even death to deny your Father. But He\nwould not have it so, and so it is NOT so. You still could not will against Him,\nand that is why you have no control over the world you made. It is NOT a world of\nwill, because it is governed by the desire to be unlike Him. And this desire IS\nNOT WILL. The world you made is therefore totally chaotic, governed by arbitrary\nand senseless “laws,” and without meaning of ANY kind. For it was made out of\nwhat you do NOT want, projected FROM your mind, because you were AFRAID of it.\n\nYet this world is ONLY in the mind of its maker, along with his REAL\nsalvation. Do not believe it is outside of yourself, for only by recognizing\nWHERE it is, will you gain control over it. For you DO have control over your\nmind, for the mind is the mechanism of decision. If you will recognize that ALL\nattack which you perceive, is in your own mind, and NOWHERE ELSE, you will at\nlast have placed its source, and where it began it must end. For in this place\nalso lies salvation. The altar of God, where Christ abideth, is there.\n\nYou have defiled the altar, but NOT the world. But Christ has placed\nthe Atonement on the altar FOR you. Bring your perceptions of the world to this\naltar, for it is the altar to truth. There you will see your vision changed, and\nthere you will learn to see truly. From this place, where God and His Son dwell\nin peace, and where you are welcome, you will look out in peace, and behold the\nworld truly. But to find the place, you must relinquish your investment in the\nworld as YOU have projected it, allowing the Holy Spirit to project the real\nworld TO you, from the altar of God.",

    "content": "Seeking and Finding\n\nThe ego is certain that love is dangerous, and this is ALWAYS its\ncentral teaching. It never PUTS it this way; on the contrary, everyone who\nbelieves that the ego is salvation is intensely engaged in the SEARCH for love.\nYet the ego, though encouraging the search very actively, makes one proviso; - do\nnot FIND it. Its dictates, then, can be summed up simply as, “Seek and do NOT\nfind.” This is the ONE promise that it holds out to you, and the one promise IT\nWILL KEEP. For the ego pursues its goal with fanatic insistence, and its realitytesting,\nthough severely impaired, is completely consistent.\n\nThe search which the ego undertakes is therefore bound to be defeated.\nAnd since it also teaches that IT is your identification, its guidance leads you\nto a journey which MUST end in perceived SELF defeat. For the ego CANNOT love,\nand in its frantic search FOR love, it is seeking WHAT IT IS AFRAID TO FIND. The\nSEARCH is inevitable, because the ego is part of your mind, and because of its\nsource, the ego is not wholly split off, or it could not be believed at all. For\nit is your mind that BELIEVES in it, and gives existence TO it. Yet it is ALSO\nyour mind that has the power to DENY its existence, and you will surely do so\nwhen you realize exactly what the journey it sets you IS.\n\nIt is surely obvious that no-one WANTS to find WHAT WOULD UTTERLY\nDEFEAT HIM. Being UNABLE to love, the ego would be totally inadequate in Love's\npresence, for it could not respond at all. YOU would HAVE to abandon its\nguidance, for it would be quite apparent that it had NOT taught you the response\npattern you NEED. The ego will therefore DISTORT love, and teach you that LOVE\ncalls forth the responses the ego CAN teach. Follow its teaching, then, and you\nwill SEARCH for love, BUT WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT.\n\nBut DO you realize that the ego MUST set you on a journey that cannot\nBUT lead to a sense of futility and depression? To seek and NOT to find is hardly\njoyous. Is this the promise YOU would keep? The Holy Spirit offers you another\npromise, and one that will lead to joy. For\nHIS promise is always, “Seek and you WILL find,” and under HIS guidance you\ncannot BE defeated. His is the journey to ACCOMPLISHMENT, and the goal HE sets\nbefore you He WILL GIVE YOU. For He will never deceive God's Son, Whom He loves\nwith the love of the Father.\n\nYou WILL undertake a journey, because you are not at home in this\nworld. And you WILL search for your home, whether you know where it is or not. If\nyou believe it is OUTSIDE yourself, the search will be futile, for you will be\nseeking where it is NOT. You do not know how to look within yourself, for you DO\nNOT BELIEVE YOUR HOME IS THERE. Yet the Holy Spirit knows it FOR you, and He will\nguide you TO your home, because that is His Mission. As He fulfills HIS mission,\nHe will teach you YOURS. For your mission is the same as His. By guiding your\nBROTHERS home, you are but following HIM.\n\nBehold the Guide your Father gave you, that you might learn you have\neternal life. For death is not your Father's Will nor yours, and whatever is true\nIS the Will of the Father. You pay no price for life, for that was given you, but\nyou DO pay a price for death, and a very heavy one. If death is your treasure,\nyou will sell everything else to purchase it. And you will believe that you\nHAVE purchased it BECAUSE you have sold everything else. BUT YOU CANNOT SELL THE\nKINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Your inheritance can neither be bought NOR sold. There can BE\nno disinherited parts of the Sonship, for God is whole, and all his extensions\nare like Him.\n\nThe Atonement was not the price of your wholeness, but it WAS the\nprice of your AWARENESS of your wholeness. For what you chose to “sell” had to be\nkept FOR you, since you COULD not “buy” it back. Yet YOU must invest in it, not\nwith money, but WITH YOUR SPIRIT. For Spirit is Will, and will IS the “price” of\nthe Kingdom. Your inheritance awaits only the recognition that you have BEEN\nredeemed. The Holy Spirit guides you into Life Eternal, but YOU must relinquish\nyour investment in death, or you will not see it, though it is all around you.",

    "content": "The Sane Curriculum\n\nOnly love is strong because it is UNDIVIDED. The strong do not attack,\nbecause they see no need to do so. BEFORE the idea of attack can enter your mind,\nYOU MUST HAVE PERCEIVED YOURSELF AS WEAK. Because you had attacked yourself, and\nBELIEVED THAT THE ATTACK WAS EFFECTIVE, you behold yourself as weakened. No\nlonger perceiving yourself and all your brothers as equal, AND REGARDING YOURSELF\nAS WEAKER, you attempt to “equalize” the situation YOU HAVE MADE. You use attack\nto do so, because you believe that ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN WEAKENING YOU.\n\nThat is why the recognition of your OWN invulnerability is so\nimportant in the restoration of your sanity. For if you accept your\ninvulnerability, you are recognizing that ATTACK HAS NO EFFECT. Although you have\nattacked yourself, and very brutally, you will demonstrate that NOTHING HAPPENED.\nTherefore, by attacking, you have NOT DONE ANYTHING. Once you realize this, there\nis no longer any SENSE in attack, for it manifestly DOES NOT WORK, it cannot\nPROTECT you. But the recognition of your invulnerability has more than merely\nnegative value.\n\nIf your attacks on yourself FAILED to weaken you, YOU ARE STILL\nSTRONG. You therefore HAVE no need to “equalize” the situation to ESTABLISH your\nstrength. But you will never realize the utter uselessness of attack, EXCEPT by\nrecognizing that your attack on YOURSELF had no effects. For others DO react to\nattack, if they perceive it, and if you ARE trying to attack them, you will be\nunable to avoid interpreting this as reinforcement. The ONLY place where you can\ncancel out ALL reinforcement, is IN YOURSELF. For YOU are always the first point\nof your attack, and if this has never been it HAS no consequences.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's Love is your strength, for yours is divided, and\ntherefore not real. You could not trust your own love, when you have ATTACKED it.\nYou cannot learn of PERFECT love with a split mind, because a split mind HAS MADE\nITSELF A POOR LEARNER. You tried to make the separation eternal because you\nwanted to RETAIN the characteristics of creation, WITH YOUR OWN CONTENT.\n\nCreation is NOT of you, and poor learners need special teaching. You\nhave learning handicaps in a very literal sense. There are areas in your learning\nskills that are so impaired, that you can progress only under constant clear-cut\ndirection, provided by a teacher who can TRANSCEND your limited resources. He\nBECOMES your resource, because OF YOURSELF, you CANNOT learn. The learning\nsituation in which you place yourself IS impossible, and IN this situation, you\nclearly require a special teacher, and a special curriculum.\n\nPoor learners are not good choices for teachers, either for themselves\nor for anyone else. You would hardly turn to THEM to establish the curriculum by\nwhich they can ESCAPE their limitations. If they understood what is BEYOND them,\nthey would not BE handicapped. You do NOT know the meaning of love, and this IS\nyour handicap. Do not attempt to teach YOURSELVES what you do not understand, and\ndo not try to set up curriculum goals, where yours have clearly failed. For YOUR\nlearning goal has been NOT TO LEARN, and this CANNOT lead to successful learning.\n\nYou cannot transfer what you have not learned, and the impairment of\nthe ability to generalize is a crucial learning failure. Would you ask those who\nhave FAILED to learn, what learning aids are FOR? THEY DO NOT KNOW. For if they\ncould INTERPRET the aids correctly, they would have LEARNED from them. We have\nsaid that the ego's rule is, “Seek and do NOT find.” Translated into curricular\nterms, this is the same as saying, “TRY to learn but DO NOT SUCCEED.”\n\nThe result of this curriculum goal is obvious. Every legitimate\nteaching aid, every real instruction, and every sensible guide to learning, WILL\nBE MISINTERPRETED. For they are all for learning FACILITATION, which this strange\ncurriculum goal is AGAINST. If you are trying to learn how NOT to learn, and\nusing the AIM of teaching TO DEFEAT ITSELF, what can you expect BUT confusion?\nThe CURRICULUM does not make any sense.\n\nThis kind of learning has so weakened your mind that you CANNOT love.\nFor the curriculum you have chosen is AGAINST love, and amounts to a course in\nHOW TO ATTACK YOURSELF. A necessary minor, supplementing this major curriculum\ngoal, is in learning how NOT to overcome the split which made this goal\nbelievable. And YOU can NOT overcome it, for all YOUR learning is on its BEHALF.\n\nYet your will speaks against your learning, as your learning speaks\nagainst your will. And so you fight AGAINST learning, and SUCCEED, for that is\nyour will. But you do NOT realize, even yet, that there IS something you DO will\nto learn, and that you CAN learn it, because it IS your will to do so. You who\nhave tried to learn what you do NOT will, should take heart. For though the\ncurriculum you set yourself is depressing indeed, it is merely ridiculous, IF YOU\nLOOK AT IT. Is it POSSIBLE that the way to achieve a goal is NOT TO ATTAIN IT?\n\nResign NOW as your own teachers. THIS resignation will NOT lead to\ndepression. It is merely the result of an honest appraisal of what you have\ntaught yourselves, and of the learning outcomes which have resulted. Under the\nproper learning conditions, which you can neither provide nor understand, you\nwill become excellent learners AND teachers. But it is not so yet, and will not\nBE so until the whole learning situation, as YOU have set it up, is reversed.\n\nYour learning POTENTIAL, properly understood, is limitless, BECAUSE IT\nWILL LEAD YOU TO GOD. You can TEACH the way to Him AND learn it, if you will\nfollow the Teacher Who knows it, and the curriculum for learning it. The\ncurriculum is totally unambiguous, because the goal is NOT divided, and the means",

    "content": "The Vision of Christ\n\nThe ego is trying to teach you how to gain the whole world, and lose\nyour own Soul. The Holy Spirit teaches that you CANNOT lose your Soul and there\nIS no gain in the world, for OF ITSELF, it profits nothing. To invest in\nsomething WITHOUT profit is surely to impoverish yourself, and the overhead is\nhigh. Not only is there no profit in the investment, but the cost TO YOU is\nenormous. For this investment costs you the world's reality, by DENYING YOURS,\nand gives you nothing in return. You CANNOT sell your Soul, but you CAN sell your\nAWARENESS of it.\n\nYou cannot perceive the soul, but you will not KNOW it while you\nperceive anything ELSE as more valuable. The Holy Spirit is your strength because\nHe perceives nothing BUT your soul AS YOU. He is perfectly aware that you do NOT\nknow yourselves, and perfectly aware of how to teach you what you are. BECAUSE He\nloves you, He will gladly teach you what He loves, for He wills to share it.\nRemembering you always, He cannot let you forget your worth. For the Father never\nceases to remind Him of His Son, and He never ceases to remind His Son of the\nFather. God is in your memory BECAUSE of Him.\n\nYou CHOSE to forget your Father, but you did NOT will to do so. And\nTHEREFORE, you CAN decide otherwise. As it was MY decision, so is it YOURS. YOU\nDO NOT WANT THE WORLD. The only thing of value in it is whatever part of it YOU\nlook upon with love. This GIVES it the only reality it will ever have. ITS value\nis NOT in itself, but yours IS in you. As self value comes from self EXTENSION,\nso does the PERCEPTION of self value come from the projection of loving thoughts\noutward.\n\nMake the world real unto YOURSELF, for the real world is the gift of\nthe Holy Spirit, and so it BELONGS to you. Correction is for all who cannot see.\nTo open the eyes of the blind is the Holy Spirit's mission, for He knows that\nthey have not LOST their vision, but merely sleep. He would awaken them from the\nsleep of forgetting, to the remembering of God. Christ's eyes are open, and He\nwill look upon whatever you see with love\nif you accept His vision as yours.\n\nThe Holy Spirit keeps the vision of Christ for every Son of God who\nsleeps. In His sight, the Son of God is perfect, and He longs to share His vision\nWITH you. He will SHOW you the real world, because God GAVE you Heaven. Through\nHim, your Father calls His Son to remember. The awakening of His Son begins with\nhis investment in the REAL world, and BY this, he will learn to REinvest in\nHIMSELF. For reality is one with the Father AND the Son, and the Holy Spirit\nblesses the real world in Their Name.\n\nWhen you have seen this real world, as you will surely do, you WILL\nremember us. But you must learn the cost of sleeping, AND REFUSE TO PAY IT. Only\nthen will you decide to awake. And then the real world will spring to your sight,\nfor Christ has never slept. He is waiting to be seen, for He has never lost sight\nof YOU. He looks quietly on the real world, which He would SHARE with you,\nbecause He knows of the Father's love for Him. And knowing this, He would give\nyou what is yours.\n\nIn perfect peace, He waits for you at His Father's altar, holding out\nthe Father's love to you, in the quiet light of the Holy Spirit's blessing. For\nthe Holy Spirit will lead everyone home to his Father, where Christ waits as his\nSelf. Every Child of God is one in Christ, for his Being is in Christ, as\nChrist's is in God. Christ's love for you is His love for His Father, which He\nknows because He knows His Father's love for Him. When the Holy Spirit has at\nlast led you to Christ, at the altar to His Father, perception fuses into\nknowledge, because perception has become so holy that its transfer to Holiness is\nmerely its natural extension.\n\nLove transfers to love without ANY interference, for the situations\nare identical. Only the ABILITY to make this transfer is the product of learning.\nAs you perceive more and more common elements in ALL situations, the transfer of\nyour training, under the Holy Spirit's guidance increases and becomes\ngeneralized. Gradually, you learn to apply it to everyone and everything, for its\napplicability IS universal. When this has been\naccomplished, perception and knowledge have become so similar that they share the\nunification of the Laws of God. What is One cannot be perceived as separate, and\nthe denial of the separation IS the reinstatement of knowledge.\n\nAt the altar of God, the holy perception of God's Son becomes so\nenlightened that light streams into it, and the Spirit of God's Son shines in the\nMind of the Father, and becomes one with it. Very gently does God shine upon\nHimself, loving the extension of Himself which is His Son. The world has no\npurpose, as it blends into the Purpose of God. For the real world has slipped\nquietly into Heaven, where everything eternal in it has always been. There, the\nRedeemer and the redeemed join in perfect love of God, and of each other. Heaven\nis your home, and being in God, it must ALSO be in you.",

Every law of time and space, of magnitude and mass, of\nprediction and control, is transcended, for what the Holy Spirit enables you to\ndo is clearly beyond ALL of them. Perceiving His RESULTS, you will understand\nwhere He MUST be, and finally KNOW what He is.\n\nYou cannot see the Holy Spirit, but you CAN see His MANIFESTATIONS.\nAnd UNLESS YOU DO, you will not realize He is there. Miracles are His witnesses,\nand speak for his Presence. What you cannot see becomes real to you only through\nthe witnesses who speak FOR it. For you can be AWARE of what you cannot see, and\nit can become compellingly real to you, as its presence becomes manifest THROUGH\nyou. Do His work, for you SHARE in His function. As your function in Heaven is\ncreation, so your function on earth is healing. God shares His function with you\nin Heaven, and the Holy Spirit shares HIS with you on earth.\n\nAs long as you believe you have two functions, so long will you need\ncorrection. For this belief is the DESTRUCTION of peace, a goal in direct\nopposition to the Holy Spirit's purpose. You see what you expect, and you expect\nwhat you invite. Your perception is the result of your invitation, coming to you\nas you sent for it. Whose manifestations would you see? Of whose presence would\nyou be convinced? For you will believe in what you MANIFEST, and as you look out\nso will you see in. Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and your\nperception will reflect the guidance you chose.\n\nI am the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and when you see me, it\nwill be because you have invited Him. For He will send you His witnesses if you\nwill but look upon them. Remember always that you see what you seek, for what you\nseek you WILL find. The ego finds what it seeks, and ONLY that. It does not find\nlove, for that is NOT what it is seeking. But seeking and finding are the same,\nand if you seek for two goals, you will FIND them, but you will RECOGNIZE\nNEITHER. For you will think they are the same, BECAUSE YOU WANT THEM BOTH. The\nmind always strives for integration, and if it is split, and WANTS TO KEEP THE\nSPLIT, it will believe it has ONE goal by MAKING IT ONE.\n\nWe said before that WHAT you project is up to you, but it is NOT up to\nyou WHETHER to project, for projection is a law of mind. Perception IS\nprojection, and you look in BEFORE you look out. As you look IN, you choose the\nguide for seeing, and THEN look out, and behold his witnesses. This is why you\nfind what you seek. What you want IN YOURSELF you will make manifest by\nPROJECTION, and you will accept it FROM the world, because you put it there BY\nwanting it.\n\nWhen you think you are projecting what you do NOT want, it is still\nbecause you DO want it. This leads DIRECTLY to dissociation, for it represents\nthe acceptance of two goals, each perceived IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, separated from\neach other BECAUSE YOU MADE THEM DIFFERENT. The mind then sees a divided world\nOUTSIDE ITSELF, but NOT within. This gives it an illusion of integrity, and\nenables it to believe that IT is pursuing one goal. As long as you perceive the\nworld as split, YOU are not healed. For to be healed is to pursue one goal,\nbecause you have ACCEPTED only one, and WANT but one.\n\nWhen you want ONLY love, you will see nothing else. The contradictory\nnature of the witnesses you perceive is merely the reflection of your conflicting\ninvitations. You have looked upon your minds, and accepted opposition there,\nhaving SOUGHT it there. But do not then believe that the witnesses FOR opposition\nare true for they attest only to your DECISION about reality, returning to you\nthe message you GAVE them. Love is recognized by its messengers. If you make it\nmanifest, its messengers will come to you, because you INVITED them.\n\nThe power of decision is your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of\nthis world. YOU CAN DECIDE TO SEE IT RIGHT. What you MADE of it is NOT its\nreality, for its reality is only what you GAVE it. You cannot REALLY give\nanything BUT love to anyone or anything, nor can you really receive anything else\nFROM them. If you think you have received anything ELSE, it is because you have\nlooked within, and thought you saw the power to GIVE something else WITHIN\nYOURSELF. It was only THIS decision that\ndetermined what you found, for it was the decision OF WHAT YOU SOUGHT.\n\nYou are afraid of me because you looked within, and are afraid of what\nyou saw. Yet you COULD not have seen reality, for the reality of your mind is the\nloveliest of God's Creations. Coming only from God, its power and grandeur could\nonly bring you peace, IF YOU REALLY LOOKED UPON IT. If you are afraid, it is\nbecause you saw something THAT IS NOT THERE. Yet in this same place you could\nhave looked upon me and all your brothers, in the perfect safety of the Mind that\ncreated us. For we are there in the peace of the Father, Who wills to PROJECT His\npeace through YOU.\n\nWhen you have accepted your mission to PROJECT peace, you will FIND\nit. For by MAKING IT MANIFEST you will SEE it. Its holy witnesses will surround\nyou, because you CALLED UPON THEM, and they will come to you. I HAVE heard your\ncall, and I have answered it, but you will not look upon me nor hear the answer\nwhich you sought. But that is only because you do not yet want ONLY that. Yet as\nI become more real to you, you will learn that you DO want only that. And you\nwill see me as you look within, and we will look upon the world as God created it\ntogether. Through the eyes of Christ, ONLY the real world exists, and can BE\nseen.\n\nAs you decide so will you see. And all that you see but witnesses to\nyour decision. When you look within and see me, it will be because you have\ndecided to manifest truth. And as you manifest it, you will see it both without\nAND within, for you will see it without BECAUSE you saw it first within.\nEverything you behold without is a JUDGMENT of what you beheld within. If it is\nYOUR judgment, it will be wrong, for judgment is not your function. If it is the\njudgment of the Holy Spirit, it will be right, for judgment IS His function. You\nshare His function only by judging AS HE DOES, reserving no judgment at all unto\nyourselves. For you will judge AGAINST yourselves, but He will judge FOR you.\n\nRemember, then, that whenever you look without and react unfavorably\nto what you see, you have judged yourself unworthy, and have condemned yourself\nto death. The death penalty is the ego's ultimate goal, for it fully believes\nthat you are a criminal, as deserving of death as God knows you are deserving of\nlife. The death penalty never leaves the ego's mind, for that is what it always\nreserves for you in the end. Wanting to kill you, as the final expression of its\nfeeling for you, it lets you live but to await death. It will torment you while\nyou live, but its hatred is not satisfied until you die. For your destruction is\nthe one end toward which it works, and the only one with which it will be\nsatisfied.\n\nThe ego is not a traitor to God to Whom treachery is impossible. But\nit IS a traitor TO YOU who believe you have been treacherous to your Father. That\nis why the undoing of GUILT is an essential part of the Holy Spirit's teaching.\nFor as long as you feel guilty, you are listening to the voice of the ego, which\ntells you that you HAVE been treacherous to God, AND THEREFORE DESERVE DEATH. You\nwill think that death comes from Him, AND NOT FROM THE EGO, because, by confusing\nyourself WITH the ego, you believe that YOU want death. And from what you want\nGod does NOT save you.\n\nWhen you are tempted to yield to the desire for death, remember that I\nDID NOT DIE. You will realize that this is true when you look within and SEE me.\nWould I have overcome death for myself alone? And would eternal life have been\ngiven me of the Father UNLESS he had also given it to YOU? When you learn to make",

    "content": "Reality and Redemption\n\nDo you REALLY believe that you can kill the Son of God? For the Father\nhas hidden His Son safely within Himself, and kept him far away from your\ndestructive thoughts, but YOU know neither the Father nor the Son because of\nthem. You ATTACK the real world every day and every hour and every minute, and\nyet you are surprised that you cannot SEE it. If you seek love to attack it, YOU\nWILL NEVER FIND IT. For if love is SHARING, how can you find it except through\nITSELF? Offer it and it will come to you, because it is drawn to itself. But\noffer attack and it will remain hidden, for it can live only in peace.\n\nGod's Son is as safe as his Father, for the Son knows his Father's\nprotection and CANNOT fear. His Father's love holds him in perfect peace, and\nneeding nothing, he asks for nothing. But he is far from you whose Self he is,\nfor you chose to attack him, and he disappeared from your sight into his Father.\nHE did not change, but YOU did. For a split mind and all its works were not\ncreated by the Father, and could not live in the knowledge OF Him.\n\nWhen you made what is NOT true visible, what is true became INVISIBLE.\nYet it cannot be invisible in ITSELF, for the Holy Spirit sees it with perfect\nclarity. It IS invisible to you, because you are looking at SOMETHING ELSE. Yet\nit is no more up to you to decide what is visible and what is invisible, than it\nis up to you to decide what reality is. What can be seen is WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT\nSEES. The definition of reality is God's, not yours. HE created it, and He knows\nwhat it is. You who knew have forgotten. And unless He had given you a way to\nremember, you would have condemned yourselves to oblivion.\n\nBecause of your Father's love, you can NEVER forget Him. For no one\ncan forget what God Himself placed in his memory. You can DENY it, but you CANNOT\nLOSE IT. A Voice will answer every question you ask, and a vision will correct\nthe perception of everything you see. For what you have made invisible is the\nonly truth, and what you have not heard is the only answer. For God would reunite\nyou with yourself, and did not abandon you in your seeming distress. You are\nwaiting only for Him, and do not know it. But His memory shines in your minds,\nand cannot BE obliterated. It is no more past than future, being forever always.\n\nYou have but to ask for this memory, and you WILL remember. But the\nmemory of God cannot shine in a mind which has MADE it invisible, and WANTS TO\nKEEP IT SO. For the memory of God can dawn only in a mind that wills to remember,\nand that has relinquished the insane desire to control reality. You who cannot\neven control yourselves, should hardly aspire to control the universe. But look\nupon what you have made of it, and rejoice that it is not so.\n\nSon of God, be not content with nothing. What is not real cannot BE\nseen, and has NO value. God could not offer His Son what has no value, nor could\nHis Son receive it. You were redeemed the instant you thought you had deserted\nHim. Everything you made has never been, and is invisible because the Holy Spirit\ndoes not see it. Yet what He DOES see is yours to behold, and through HIS vision\nYOUR perception is healed. You have made the INvisible the only truth that this\nworld holds. Valuing nothing, you have sought it and found it. By making nothing\nreal to you, you have SEEN it.\n\nBUT IT IS NOT THERE. And Christ is invisible to you BECAUSE OF WHAT\nYOU HAVE MADE VISIBLE TO YOURSELVES. Yet it does not matter how much distance you\nhave tried to interpose between your awareness and Truth. God's Son CAN be seen,\nbecause His Vision is shared. The Holy Spirit looks upon Him, and sees nothing\nelse in you. What is invisible to you is perfect in His sight, and encompasses\nALL of it. He has remembered YOU because He forgot not the Father.\n\nYou looked upon the unreal and found despair. But by SEEKING the\nunreal, what else COULD you find? The UNreal world IS a thing of despair, for it\ncan never be. And you who share God's Being with Him, could never be content\nWITHOUT reality. What God did not give you has no power over you, and the\nattraction of love for love remains irresistible. For it is the function of love\nto unite all things unto itself, and to hold all things together by extending its\nwholeness.\n\nThe real world was given you by God, in loving exchange for the world\nYOU made, and which you SEE. But take it from the hand of Christ, and look upon\nit. ITS reality will make everything ELSE invisible, for beholding it is TOTAL\nperception. And as you look upon it, you will remember that it was always so.\nNothingness will become invisible, for you will at last have seen truly.

    "content": "Guiltlessness and Invulnerability\n\nIf you did not feel guilty, you could not attack. For condemnation is\nthe root of attack. It is the judgment of one mind by another as UNWORTHY of\nlove, and DESERVING of punishment. But herein lies the split. For the mind that\njudges, perceives itself as SEPARATE from the mind being judged, believing that\nby punishing ANOTHER, IT will escape punishment. All this is but the delusional\nattempt of the mind to deny itself, and ESCAPE THE PENALTY OF DENIAL. It is NOT\nan attempt to RELINQUISH denial, but to HOLD ON TO IT. For it is guilt that has\nobscured the Father to you, and it is guilt that has driven you insane. The\nacceptance of guilt into the mind of God's Son was the beginning of the\nseparation, as the acceptance of the Atonement is its end.\n\nThe world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt.\nLook carefully at this world, and you will realize that this is so. For this\nworld is the symbol of punishment, and all the laws which seem to govern it are\nthe laws of death. Children are born into it through pain and in pain. Their\ngrowth is attended by suffering, and they learn of sorrow and separation and\ndeath. Their minds are trapped in their brain, and its powers decline if their\nbodies are hurt. They seem to love, yet they desert, and are deserted. They\nappear to lose what they love, perhaps the most insane belief of all. And their\nbodies wither and gasp and are laid in the ground, and seem to be no more. Not\none of them but has thought that God is cruel.\n\nIf this were the real world, God WOULD be cruel. For no father could\nsubject his children to this as the price of salvation, and be loving. LOVE DOES\nNOT KILL TO SAVE. For if it did, attack WOULD be salvation, and this is the ego's\ninterpretation, NOT God's.\nOnly the world of guilt could demand this, for only the guilty could CONCEIVE of\nit. Adam's “sin” could have touched none of you, had you not believed that it was\nthe FATHER Who drove him out of Paradise. For it is in THAT belief that knowledge\nof the Father was lost, for it is only those who do not understand Him that COULD\nbelieve it.\n\nThis world IS a picture of the crucifixion of God's Son. And until you\nrealize that God's Son CANNOT be crucified, this is the world you will see. But\nyou will NOT realize this, until you accept the eternal fact that GOD'S SON IS\nNOT GUILTY. He DESERVES only love, because he has GIVEN only love. He cannot be\ncondemned, because he has never condemned. The Atonement is the final lesson he\nneed learn, for it teaches him that, never having sinned, HE HAS NO NEED OF\nSALVATION.\n\nLong ago we said that the Holy Spirit shares the goal of all good\nteachers, whose ultimate aim is to make themselves unnecessary, by teaching their\npupils all they know. The Holy Spirit wills ONLY this, for sharing the Father's\nlove for His Son, He wills to remove all guilt from his mind, that he may\nremember his Father in peace. For peace and guilt are antithetical, and the\nFather can BE remembered ONLY in peace. Love and guilt cannot coexist, and to\naccept one is to DENY the other.\n\nGuilt hides Christ from your sight, for it is the denial of the\nblamelessness of God's Son. In this strange world which you have made, the Son of\nGod HAS sinned. How could you SEE him, then? By making HIM invisible, the world\nof retribution rose in the black cloud of guilt which you accepted, and you hold\nit dear. For the blamelessness of Christ is the proof that the ego never was, and\ncan never be. Without guilt the ego HAS no life, and God's Son\nIS without guilt.\n\nAs you look upon yourselves and judge what you do honestly, as you\nhave been asked to do, you may be tempted to wonder how you can be guiltless. But\nconsider this. You are NOT guiltless in time, but IN ETERNITY. You HAVE “sinned”\nIN THE PAST, but there IS no past. Always has no direction. Time seems to go in\none direction, but when you reach its end, it will roll up like a long carpet\nthat has spread along the past behind you, and will disappear. As long as you\nbelieve the Son of God is guilty, you will walk along this carpet, believing that\nit leads to death. And the journey will seem long and cruel and senseless, for so\nit is.\n\nThe journey which the Son of God has set HIMSELF is foolish indeed.\nBut the journey on which his Father sets him is one of release and joy. The\nFather is not cruel, and His Son CANNOT hurt himself. The retaliation which he\nfears, AND WHICH HE SEES, will never touch him, for although he BELIEVES in it,\nthe Holy Spirit KNOWS it is not true. He stands at the end of time, where YOU\nmust be, because He is WITH you. He has ALWAYS undone everything unworthy of the\nSon of God, for such was His mission, given BY God. And what God gives HAS always\nbeen.\n\nYou will see me as you learn the Son of God is guiltless. He has\nalways sought his guiltlessness, and he has FOUND it. For everyone is seeking to\nescape from the prison he has made, and the way to find release is not denied\nhim. Being IN him, he has found it. WHEN he finds it is only a matter of time,\nand time is but an illusion. For the Son of God is guiltless NOW, and the\nbrightness of his purity shines untouched forever in God's Mind. God's Son will\nALWAYS be as he was created. Deny YOUR world, and judge him not. For his eternal\nguiltlessness is in the mind of his Father, and protects him forever.\n\nWhen you have accepted the Atonement for yourselves, you will realize\nthat THERE IS NO GUILT IN GOD'S SON. And ONLY as you look upon him as guiltless,\ncan you understand his Oneness. For the IDEA of guilt brings a belief of\ncondemnation of one by another, projecting separation in place of unity. You can\ncondemn only yourself, and by doing so, you cannot know that you are God's Son.\nFor you have denied the condition of his Being, which is his perfect\nblamelessness. Out of Love he was created, and in Love he abides. Goodness and\nmercy have always followed him, for he has always extended the Love of his\nFather.\n\nAs you perceive the holy companions who travel with you, you will\nrealize that there IS no journey, but only an awakening. The Son of God, who\nsleepeth not, has kept faith with his Father FOR you. There is no road to travel\nON, and no time to travel THROUGH. For God waits not for His Son in time, being\nforever unwilling to be without him. And so it has always been. Let the holiness\nof God's Son shine away the cloud of guilt that darkens your mind, and by\naccepting his purity AS yours, learn of him that it IS yours.\n\nYou are invulnerable BECAUSE you are guiltless. You can hold on to the\npast ONLY through guilt. For guilt establishes that you WILL BE punished for what\nyou have done, and thus depends on one-dimensional time, proceeding from past to\nfuture. No-one who believes this, can understand what ALWAYS means. And therefore\nguilt MUST deprive you of the appreciation of eternity. You are immortal BECAUSE\nyou are eternal, and always MUST be now. Guilt, then, is a way of holding past\nand future in your minds, to ensure the ego's continuity. For if what it HAS\nBEEN WILL BE punished, it's continuity WOULD be guaranteed.\n\nBut the guarantee of your continuity is God's, not the ego's. And\nimmortality is the opposite of time, for time passes away, while immortality is\nconstant. Accepting the Atonement teaches you WHAT IMMORTALITY IS, for by\naccepting your guiltlessness, you learn that the past has never been, and so the\nfuture is needless. The future IN TIME is ALWAYS associated with expiation, and\nONLY guilt could induce a sense of NEED for expiation. Accepting the\nguiltlessness of the Son of God AS YOURS is therefore God's way of reminding you\nof His Son, and what he is in truth. For God has never condemned His Son, and\nbeing guiltless, he IS eternal.\n\nYou cannot dispel guilt by making it real, and THEN atoning for it.\nFor this is the ego's plan, which it offers INSTEAD of dispelling it. The ego\nbelieves in ATONEMENT THROUGH ATTACK, being fully committed to the insane notion\nthat attack IS salvation. And YOU who cherish guilt must ALSO believe it, for how\nelse but by identifying WITH the ego, could you hold dear what you do not want?\n\nThe ego teaches you to attack yourself BECAUSE you are guilty, and\nthis MUST INCREASE the guilt, for guilt is the RESULT of attack. In the ego's\nteaching, then, there IS no escape from guilt. For attack MAKES GUILT REAL, and\nif it is real there IS no way to overcome it. The Holy Spirit dispels it simply\nthrough the calm recognition that it has never been. As He looks upon the\nguiltless Son of God, he KNOWS this is true. And being true for you, you CANNOT\nattack yourself, for WITHOUT guilt, attack is impossible. You, then, ARE saved\nBECAUSE God's Son is guiltless. And being wholly pure, you ARE invulnerable.",

    "content": "Crucifixion by Guilt\n\nThe darkest of your hidden cornerstones holds your belief in guilt\nfrom your own awareness. For in that dark and secret place is the realization\nthat you have betrayed God's Son, by condemning him to death. You do not even\nSUSPECT that this murderous but insane idea lies hidden there. For the ego's\ndestructive urge is so intense, that nothing short of the crucifixion of God's\nSon can ultimately satisfy it. It does not know who the Son of God IS, because it\nis blind. But let it perceive guiltlessness ANYWHERE, and it will try to destroy\nit, because it is afraid.\n\nMuch of the ego's strange behavior is directly attributable to its\ndefinition of guilt. To the ego, THE GUILTLESS ARE GUILTY. Those who do NOT\nattack are its “enemies,” because, by NOT VALUING its interpretation of\nsalvation, they are in an excellent position to LET IT GO. They have approached\nthe darkest and deepest cornerstone in the ego's foundation, and while it can\nwithstand your raising all else to question, it guards this one secret with\nits life, for its existence DOES depend on keeping this secret. And it is this\nsecret that we must look upon calmly, for the ego cannot protect you AGAINST\ntruth, and in ITS presence the ego is dispelled.\n\nIn the calm light of truth, let us recognize that YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE\nCRUCIFIED GOD'S SON. You have not admitted this “terrible” secret, because you\nstill wish to crucify him, IF YOU COULD FIND HIM. But the wish has hidden him\nfrom you, because it is very fearful, AND YOU ARE AFRAID TO FIND HIM. You have\nhandled this wish TO KILL YOURSELF by NOT KNOWING WHO YOU ARE, and identifying\nwith something ELSE. You have projected guilt blindly and indiscriminately, but\nyou have NOT uncovered its source. For the ego DOES want to kill you, and if you\nidentify WITH it, you MUST believe ITS GOAL IS YOURS.\n\nWe once said that the crucifixion is the symbol of the ego. When it\nwas confronted with the REAL guiltlessness of God's Son, it DID attempt to kill\nhim. And the reason it gave was that guiltlessness is blasphemous to God. To the\nego, THE EGO IS GOD, and guiltlessness MUST be interpreted AS THE FINAL GUILT\nWHICH FULLY JUSTIFIES MURDER. You do not yet understand that ALL your fear of\nthis course stems ultimately from this interpretation, but if you will consider\nyour reactions TO it, you will become increasingly convinced that this is so.\n\nThis course has explicitly stated that its goal FOR YOU is happiness\nand peace. Yet you are AFRAID of it. You have been told again and again that it\nwill make you free, yet you react as if it is trying to IMPRISON you. Most of the\ntime you DISMISS it, BUT YOU DO NOT DISMISS THE EGO'S THOUGHT SYSTEM. You HAVE\nseen its results and you STILL lack faith in it. You MUST, then, believe that, by\nNOT learning the course, YOU ARE PROTECTING YOURSELF. And you do NOT realize that\nit is only your guiltlessness that CAN protect you.\n\nThe Atonement has always been interpreted as the release from guilt,\nand this is correct, if it is understood. Yet even when I have interpreted it FOR\nyou, you have rejected it, and have NOT accepted it FOR YOURSELF. You have\nrecognized the futility of the ego and its offerings, but though you do not want\nit, you will not look upon the alternative with gladness. YOU ARE AFRAID OF\nREDEMPTION, and YOU BELIEVE IT WILL KILL YOU. Make no mistake about the depth of\nyour fear. For you believe that, in the presence of truth, you will turn on\nyourself and DESTROY yourself.\n\nLittle children, this is not so. Your “guilty secret” is nothing, and\nif you will but bring it to light, the Light WILL dispel it. And then no dark\ncloud will remain between you and the remembrance of your Father. For you will\nremember His guiltless Son, who did not die because he is immortal. And you will\nsee that you were redeemed WITH him, and have never been separated FROM him.

And you may think that it would be easy enough for\nthe Holy Spirit to show it to you, and dispel it WITHOUT the need for you to\nraise it to awareness yourself. But there is one more complication which you have\ninterposed between yourself and the Atonement, that you do not yet realize. We\nhave said that no one will countenance fear, IF HE RECOGNIZES IT. But in your\ndisordered state, YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF FEAR. You do not LIKE it, but it is NOT\nyour desire to attack which really frightens you. You are not seriously disturbed\nby your hostility. You keep it hidden, because you are MORE afraid of what it\ncovers.\n\nYou could look even upon the ego's darkest cornerstone WITHOUT fear,\nif you did not believe that, WITHOUT THE EGO, you would find, within yourself,\nsomething you fear even more. YOU ARE NOT AFRAID OF CRUCIFIXION. Your real terror\nis of REDEMPTION. Under the ego's dark foundation is the memory of God, and it is\nof THIS that you are really afraid. For this memory would INSTANTLY restore you\nto your proper place, and it is THIS place that you have sought to LEAVE.\n\nYour fear of attack is nothing, compared to your fear of love. You\nwould be willing to look upon your savage wish to kill God's Son, IF YOU DID NOT\nBELIEVE THAT IT SAVES YOU FROM LOVE. For this wish CAUSED the separation. You\nhave protected it, because you do not WANT the separation healed, and you realize\nthat, by REMOVING the dark cloud that obscures it, your love for your Father\nwould IMPEL you to answer His call, and leap into Heaven. You believe that attack\nis salvation, to PREVENT you from this. For still deeper than the ego's\nfoundation, and MUCH stronger than IT will ever be, is your intense and burning\nlove of God, AND HIS FOR YOU.\n\nTHIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO HIDE. In honesty, is it not harder for\nyou to say “I love” than “I hate?” For you associate love with weakness and\nhatred with strength, and your REAL power seems to you as your real weakness. For\nyou could NOT control your joyous response to the call of love if you heard it,\nand the whole world you THINK you control WOULD vanish. The Holy Spirit, then,\nseems to be ATTACKING YOUR FORTRESS, for you would SHUT OUT GOD, and He does not\nwill to BE excluded.\n\nYou have built your whole insane belief system, because you think you\nwould be HELPLESS in God's Presence. And you would SAVE yourself from His love,\nbecause you think it would crush you into nothingness. You are afraid it would\nsweep you AWAY from yourself, AND MAKE YOU LITTLE. For you believe that magnitude\nlies in defiance, and attack is grandeur. YOU THINK YOU HAVE MADE A WORLD THAT\nGOD WOULD DESTROY. And by loving Him, WHICH YOU DO, you would throw this world\naway, WHICH YOU WOULD.\n\nTherefore, you have used the world to COVER YOUR LOVE, and the deeper\nyou go into the blackness of the ego's foundation, the CLOSER you come to the\nLove that is hidden beneath it. AND IT IS THIS THAT FRIGHTENS YOU. You can accept\ninsanity, BECAUSE YOU MADE IT. But you cannot accept love, BECAUSE YOU DID NOT.\nYou would rather be slaves of the crucifixion, than Sons of God in redemption.\nFor your INDIVIDUAL death is more valued than your living Oneness, and what is\nGIVEN you, is not so dear as what you MADE. You are more afraid of God than of\nthe ego, and love cannot enter where it is not welcome. But hatred CAN, for it\nenters of ITS will, and cares not for YOURS.\n\nThe reason you must look upon your delusions, and not keep them\nhidden, is that THEY DO NOT REST ON THEIR OWN FOUNDATION. In concealment, they\nAPPEAR to do so, and thus they seem to be SELF-SUSTAINED. THIS is the fundamental\nillusion on which they rest. For BENEATH them, and concealed as long as THEY are\nhidden, is the loving mind that THOUGHT it made them in anger. And the pain in\nthis mind is so apparent, when it is uncovered, that its need of healing cannot\nBE denied. Not all the tricks and games that you have offered it can heal it,\nfor HERE is the REAL crucifixion of God's Son.\n\nAnd yet he is NOT crucified. For here is both his pain AND his\nhealing, for the Holy Spirit's vision is merciful, and His remedy is quick. Do\nnot HIDE suffering from His sight, but bring it gladly TO Him. Lay before His\neternal sanity ALL your hurt, and LET Him heal you. Do not leave any spot of pain\nhidden from His Light, and search your minds carefully for any thoughts which you\nmay fear to uncover. For He will heal every little thought that you have kept to\nhurt you, and cleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God.\n\nBeneath all your grandiosity, which you hold so dear, is your real\ncall for help. For you call for love to your Father, as your Father calls you to\nHimself. In that place, which you have hidden, you will only to unite with the\nFather, in loving remembrance of Him. You will find this place of truth as you\nsee it in your brothers, for though they may deceive themselves, like you they\nlong for the grandeur that is in them. And perceiving it you will WELCOME it, and\nit will be yours. For grandeur is the RIGHT of God's Son, and no illusions can\nsatisfy him, or save him from what he IS.\n\nOnly his love is real, and he will be content ONLY with his reality.\nSave him from his illusions, that you may accept the magnitude of your Father in\npeace and joy. But exempt no one from your love, or you will be hiding a dark\nplace in your minds, where the Holy Spirit is not welcome. And you will exempt\nYOURSELF from His healing power, for by not offering total love, YOU will not be\nhealed completely. And healing must be as complete as fear, for love cannot enter\nwhere there is one spot of fear to mar its welcome.\n\nYou who prefer specialness to sanity could not obtain it in your right\nminds. You were at peace until you asked for special favor, and God did not give\nit. For the request was alien to Him, and you could not ask this of a Father who\ntruly loved His Son. Therefore, you made of Him an UNloving father, demanding of\nHim what only such a father COULD give. And the peace of God's Son was shattered,\nfor he no longer understood his Father. He feared what he had made, but still\nmore did he fear his REAL Father, having attacked his glorious equality WITH Him.\n\nIn peace he needed nothing, and asked for nothing. In war he DEMANDED\neverything, and FOUND nothing. For how could the gentleness of love respond to\nhis demands, EXCEPT by departing in peace, and returning to the Father? If the\nSon did not wish to REMAIN in peace, he could not remain at all. For a darkened\nmind cannot live in the light, and it must seek a place of darkness, where it can\nbelieve it is where it is NOT. God did not ALLOW this to happen. But you DEMANDED\nthat it happen, and therefore believed that it was so.\n\nTo SINGLE OUT is to MAKE ALONE, and thus MAKE LONELY. God did not do\nthis to you. Could He SET YOU APART, KNOWING that your peace lies in His Oneness?\nHe denied you only your request for pain, for suffering is not of His creation.\nHaving GIVEN you creation, He could not take it FROM you. He could but answer\nyour insane request with a sane answer, which would abide with you in your\ninsanity. AND THIS HE DID. No-one who hears His answer but will give up insanity.",

    "content": "Healing and Time\n\nAnd now the reason why you are afraid of this course should be\napparent. For this is a course on love, because it is about YOU. You have been\ntold that your function in this world is healing, and your function in Heaven is\ncreating. The ego teaches that your function on earth is destruction, and that\nyou have no function AT ALL in Heaven. It would thus destroy you here, and bury\nyou here, leaving you no inheritance except the dust out of which it thinks you\nwere made. While it is reasonably satisfied with you, as its reasoning goes, it\noffers you oblivion. When it becomes overtly savage, it offers you hell.\n\nYet neither oblivion nor hell is as unacceptable to you as Heaven. For\nyour definition of Heaven IS hell and oblivion, and the REAL Heaven is the\ngreatest threat you think you COULD experience. For hell and oblivion are ideas\nwhich YOU made up, and you are bent on DEMONSTRATING their reality, TO ESTABLISH\nYOURS. If THEIR reality is questioned, you believe that YOURS is. For you believe\nthat ATTACK established your reality, and that your DESTRUCTION is the final\nproof THAT YOU WERE RIGHT.\n\nUnder the circumstances, would it not be MORE DESIRABLE to have been\nwrong, even apart from the fact that you WERE wrong? For while it could perhaps\nbe argued that death suggests there WAS life, no one would claim that it proves\nthere IS life. And even the PAST life, which death might indicate, could only\nhave been futile if it must come to this, and NEEDS this to prove that it WAS.\nYou question Heaven, but you do NOT question this. You could heal and be healed,\nif you DID question it. And even though you know not Heaven, might it not be more\ndesirable than death? You have been as selective in your questioning as in your\nperception. An open mind is more honest than this.\nOct. , 1966\n\nThe ego has a very strange notion of time, and it is with this notion\nthat the questioning might well begin. The ego invests heavily in the past, and\nin the end, believes that the past is the ONLY aspect of time that is meaningful.\nYou will remember that we said its emphasis on guilt enables it to ensure its\ncontinuity, by MAKING THE FUTURE LIKE THE PAST, and thus AVOIDING the present. By\nthe notion of PAYING FOR the past in the future, the past becomes the DETERMINER\nof the future, making THEM continuous, WITHOUT an intervening present. For the\nego uses the present ONLY as a brief transition TO the future, in which it brings\nthe past TO the future, BY INTERPRETING THE PRESENT IN PAST TERMS.\n\nNOW has no meaning to the ego. The present merely reminds it of PAST\nhurts, and it reacts to the present AS IF it were past. For the ego cannot\ntolerate RELEASE from the past, and though it is no more, the ego tries to\npreserve its IMAGE by responding as if it were present. Thus, it dictates\nreactions to those you meet NOW from a PAST reference point, obscuring their\nPRESENT reality. In effect, if you FOLLOW its dictates, you will react to your\nbrothers as though they were SOMEONE ELSE, and this will surely prevent you from\nperceiving them AS THEY ARE. And you will receive messages from them out of your\nOWN past because, by making it real in the present, you are forbidding yourself\nto LET IT GO. You thus DENY yourself the message of release that every brother\noffers you NOW.\n\nThe shadowy figures from the past are precisely what you must ESCAPE.\nFor they are not real, and have no hold over you, unless YOU bring them WITH you.\nThey carry the spots of pain in your minds, directing you to attack in the\npresent, in retaliation for a past that is no more. AND THIS DECISION IS ONE OF\nFUTURE PAIN. For unless you learn that PAST pain is delusional, you are choosing\na future of delusions, and losing the endless opportunities which you COULD find\nfor release in the present. For the ego would PRESERVE\nyour nightmares, and PREVENT you from awaking, and understanding that THEY are\npast.\n\nWould you RECOGNIZE a holy encounter, if you are merely perceiving it\nas a meeting with your OWN past? For you are meeting no one, and the SHARING of\nsalvation, WHICH MAKES THE ENCOUNTER HOLY, is excluded from your sight. The Holy\nSpirit teaches that you always meet YOURSELF, and the encounter is holy because\nYOU are. The ego teaches that you always encounter your PAST, and because your\ndreams WERE not holy, the future CANNOT be, and the present is without meaning.\nIt is evident that the Holy Spirit's perception of time is the exact opposite of\nthe ego's. And the reason is equally clear, for they perceive the GOAL of time as\ndiametrically opposed.\n\nThe Holy Spirit interprets time's PURPOSE as rendering the need for it\nUNNECESSARY. Thus does He regard the function of time as temporary, serving only\nHis teaching function, which is temporary by definition. HIS emphasis is\ntherefore on the ONLY aspect of time which CAN extend to the infinite. For NOW is\nthe closest approximation of eternity that this world offers. And it is in the\nREALITY of now, without past OR future, that the beginning of the appreciation of\neternity lies. For only now is HERE, and IT presents the opportunities for the\nholy encounters, in which salvation can be found.\n\nThe ego, on the other hand, regards the function of time as one of\nextending itself IN PLACE of eternity. For, like the Holy Spirit, the ego\ninterprets the goal of time as its own. The continuity of past and future, UNDER\nITS DIRECTION, is the only purpose it perceives in time, and it closes over the\npresent, so that no gap in the EGO'S continuity can occur. ITS continuity, then,\nwould KEEP you in time, while the Holy Spirit would release you FROM it. And it\nis HIS interpretation of the means of salvation that you must learn to accept, if\nyou would share His goal of salvation FOR you.\n\nYou, too, will interpret the function of time as you interpret yours.\nIf you accept your function in the world of time AS HEALING, you will emphasize\nONLY the aspect of time in which healing can occur. For healing CANNOT be\naccomplished in the past, and MUST be accomplished in the present to RELEASE the\nfuture. THIS interpretation ties the future to the present, and EXTENDS THE\nPRESENT, rather than the past. But if you interpret your function as DESTRUCTION,",

    "content": "The Two Emotions\n\nWe have said that you have but two emotions, love and fear. One is\nchangeless but continually exchanged, being offered BY the eternal TO the\neternal. In this exchange it is extended, for it INCREASES as it is given. The\nother has many forms, for the content of INDIVIDUAL illusions differs greatly.\nBut they have one thing in common; they are all insane. They are made of sights\nwhich are NOT seen, and sounds which are NOT heard. They make up a PRIVATE world\nwhich CANNOT be shared. For they are meaningful ONLY to their maker, and so they\nhave no meaning at all. In this world their maker moves alone, for only HE\nperceives them.\n\nEach one peoples his world with figures from his INDIVIDUAL past, and\nit is because of this that private worlds DO differ. But the figures that he sees\nwere NEVER real, for they are made up ONLY of his REACTIONS to his brothers, and\ndo NOT include their reactions to HIM. Therefore he does not see that he made\nthem, and that they ARE NOT WHOLE. For these figures HAVE NO WITNESSES, being\nperceived in one SEPARATE mind only.\n\nIt is THROUGH these strange and shadowy figures that the insane relate\nto their insane world. For they SEE only those who remind them of these images,\nand it is to THEM that they relate. Thus do they communicate with those who ARE\nNOT THERE, and it is THEY who answer them. And no-one hears their answer save him\nwho called upon them, and he ALONE believes they answered him. Projection MAKES\nperception, and you CANNOT see beyond it. Again and again have men attacked each\nother, because they saw IN THEM a shadow figure in their private world.\n\nAnd thus it is that you MUST attack yourself first. For what you\nattack is NOT in others. Its ONLY reality is in your OWN mind, and by attacking\nothers, you are literally attacking WHAT IS NOT THERE. The delusional can be very\ndestructive, for they do not recognize they have condemned THEMSELVES. They do\nnot wish to die, YET THEY WILL NOT LET CONDEMNATION GO. And so they SEPARATE into\ntheir private world, where everything is disordered, and where what is within,\nappears to be without. Yet what IS within they do NOT see, for the REALITY of\ntheir brothers they CANNOT see.\n\nYou have but two emotions, yet in your private world, you react to\neach of them AS THOUGH IT WERE THE OTHER. For love cannot abide in a world apart,\nwhere, when it comes, it is not recognized. If you see your own hatred AS your\nbrother, you are not seeing HIM. Everyone draws nigh unto what he loves, and\nrecoils from what he fears. And you react with fear to love, and draw AWAY from\nit. But fear ATTRACTS you, and believing it is love, you call it to yourself.\nYour private world is filled with the figures of fear you have invited into it.\nAnd all the love your brothers offer you, YOU DO NOT SEE.\n\nAs you look with open eyes upon your world, it MUST occur to you that\nyou have withdrawn into insanity. For you see what is not there, and hear what is\nsoundless. Your behavioral MANIFESTATIONS of emotions are the OPPOSITE of what\nthe emotions ARE. You communicate with no-one, and you are as isolated from\nreality, as if you were ALONE in all the universe. In your madness, you OVERLOOK\nREALITY COMPLETELY, and you see ONLY YOUR SPLIT MIND everywhere you look. God\ncalls you and you do not hear, for you are preoccupied with your own voice. And\nthe vision of Christ is not in your sight, for you look upon yourself ALONE.\n\nLittle children, would you offer THIS to your Father? For if you offer\nit to yourself, you ARE offering it to Him. And He will NOT return it, for it is\nunworthy of you BECAUSE it is unworthy of Him. But He WOULD release you\nfrom it, and set you free. His sane answer tells you that what you have offered\nYOURSELF is NOT true, but HIS offering TO you has never changed. You who know not\nwhat you do, CAN learn what insanity IS, and look beyond it. It is GIVEN you to\nlearn how to DENY insanity, and come forth from your private world in peace.\n\nAnd you will see all that you denied in your brothers, BECAUSE you\ndenied it in yourself. For you will love them, and by drawing nigh unto them, you\nwill draw them to YOURSELF, perceiving them as witnesses to your reality, which\nyou share with GOD. For I am WITH them, as I am with YOU. And we will draw them\nfrom their private world, for as we are united, so would we unite with them. The\nFather welcomes all of us in gladness, and gladness is what WE would offer Him.\nFor every Son of God is given you, to whom God gave HIMSELF. And it is God Whom\nyou must offer them, to recognize His gift to YOU.\n\nVision depends on light, and you CANNOT see in darkness. Yet in the\ndarkness, in the private world of sleep, you SEE in dreams, although your eyes\nare closed. And it is here that WHAT you see YOU MADE. But let the DARKNESS go,\nand ALL you made YOU WILL NO LONGER SEE, for sight of IT depends upon DENYING\nvision. But from denying vision, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT YOU CANNOT SEE. Yet this\nis what denial DOES, for BY it you ACCEPT insanity, believing you can make a\nprivate world, AND RULE YOUR OWN PERCEPTION. But FOR this, light MUST be\nexcluded. Dreams disappear when light has come, AND YOU CAN SEE.\n\nDo not seek vision through YOUR eyes. For you MADE your way of seeing,\nthat you might see in darkness, and in this you ARE deceived. BEYOND this\ndarkness, and yet still WITHIN you, is the vision of Christ, Who looks on all in\nlight. YOUR vision comes from fear, as His from Love. And He sees FOR you, as\nyour witness to the real world. He is the Holy Spirit's\nMANIFESTATION, looking always on the real world, and calling forth its witnesses,\nand drawing them unto YOU. For He loves what He sees within you, and He would\nEXTEND it. And He will not return unto the Father, until He has extended your\nperception even unto Him. And there perception is no more, for He has RETURNED\nyou to the Father WITH Him.\n\nYou have but two emotions, and one you made and one was GIVEN you.\nEach is a WAY OF SEEING, and different worlds arise from their different visions.\nSee through the vision that is GIVEN you, for through Christ's vision He beholds\nHimself. And seeing what He is, He knows His Father. Beyond your darkest dreams,\nHe sees God's guiltless Son within you, shining in perfect radiance, which is\nundimmed by your dreams. And this YOU will see, as you look with Him. For His\nvision is His gift of love to you, given Him of the Father FOR you.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the light in which Christ stands revealed. And all\nwho would behold Him can see Him, for they have ASKED for light. Nor will they\nsee Him ALONE, for He is no more alone than THEY are. Because they SAW the Son,\nthey have risen IN Him to the Father. And all this will they understand, because\nthey looked within, and saw, beyond the darkness, the Christ in them, and\nRECOGNIZED Him. In the sanity of His vision, they looked upon themselves with\nlove, seeing themselves as the Holy Spirit sees them. And WITH this vision of the\ntruth in THEM, came all the beauty of the world to shine upon them.",

    "content": "Finding the Present\n\nTo perceive truly is to be aware of ALL reality, through the awareness\nof your own. But for this, NO illusions can rise to meet your sight, for ALL\nreality leaves no room for ANY error. This means that you perceive a brother only\nAS YOU SEE HIM NOW. His past has NO reality in the present, and you CANNOT see\nit. Your past reactions TO him are also NOT THERE, and if it is to these that you\nreact NOW, you see but an image of him that you made and cherish INSTEAD of him.\nIn your questioning of delusions, ask yourself if it is REALLY sane to perceive\nWHAT WAS NOW. If you remember the PAST as you look upon him, you will be unable\nto perceive the reality that is NOW.\n\nYou consider it “natural” to use your PAST experience as the reference\npoint from which to JUDGE the present. Yet this is UNnatural, because it is\ndelusional. When you have learned to look upon everyone with NO REFERENCE AT ALL\nto the past, either his OR yours as you perceived it, you will be able to learn\nFROM WHAT YOU SEE NOW. For the past can cast no shadow to darken the present,\nUNLESS YOU ARE AFRAID OF LIGHT. And ONLY if you are, would you choose to bring\nthis darkness WITH you, and by holding it in your minds, see it as a dark cloud\nthat shrouds your brothers, and conceals their reality from your sight.\n\nTHIS DARKNESS IS IN YOU. The Christ revealed to you NOW has no past,\nfor He is changeless. AND IN HIS CHANGELESSNESS LIES YOUR RELEASE. For if He is\nas He was created, there IS no guilt in Him. No cloud of guilt has risen to\nobscure Him, and He stands revealed in everyone you meet, because you see Him\nthrough HIMSELF.\nTo be born again is to let the PAST go, and LOOK WITHOUT CONDEMNATION UPON THE\nPRESENT. For the cloud which obscures God's Son to you IS the past, and if you\nwould have it past AND GONE, you must NOT SEE IT NOW. And if you see it now in\nyour delusions, it has NOT gone from you, although it is not there.\n\nTime can release as well as imprison, depending on whose\ninterpretation of it you use. Past, present, and future are not continuous,\nUNLESS YOU FORCE CONTINUITY ON THEM. You can PERCEIVE them as continuous, and\nmake them so FOR YOU. But do not be deceived, and then believe that this is how\nit IS, for to believe that reality is what you would HAVE it be, according to\nYOUR use for it, IS delusional. You would DESTROY time's continuity by breaking\nit into past, present, and future, FOR YOUR OWN PURPOSES. You would anticipate\nthe future on the basis of your PAST experience and plan for it accordingly. And\nby so doing, you are ALIGNING past and future, and not allowing the miracles,\nwhich could intervene BETWEEN them, to free you to be born again.\n\nThe miracle enables you to see your brother WITHOUT his past, and so\nperceive him as born again. His errors ARE all past, and by perceiving him\nWITHOUT them, you are RELEASING him. And since his past is yours, you SHARE in\nthis release. Let no dark cloud out of YOUR past obscure him from you, for truth\nlies ONLY in the present, and you WILL find it if you seek it there. You have\nlooked for it where it is NOT, and therefore have not found it. Learn, then, to\nseek it where it IS, and it WILL dawn on eyes that see. Your past was made in\nanger, and if you use it to ATTACK the present you will NOT SEE the freedom that\nthe present holds.\nJudgment and condemnation are BEHIND you, and unless you bring them WITH you, you\nWILL see that you are free of them.\n\nLook lovingly upon the present, for it holds the ONLY things that are\nforever true. All healing lies within it, because ITS continuity is real. It\nextends to ALL aspects of consciousness AT THE SAME TIME, and thus enables them\nto REACH EACH OTHER. The present is before time WAS, and WILL BE when time is no\nmore. In it is everything that is eternal, and they ARE one. THEIR continuity is\ntimeless, and their communication is unbroken, for they are NOT SEPARATED by the\npast. Only the past CAN separate, and IT is nowhere.\n\nThe present offers you your brothers in the light that would unite you\nWITH them, and free YOU from the past. Would you, then, hold the past AGAINST\nthem? For if you do, you are choosing to remain in the darkness THAT IS NOT\nTHERE, and refusing to accept the light that is offered you. For the light of\nperfect vision is freely given, as it is freely received, and can be accepted\nonly WITHOUT LIMIT. In this one, still dimension of time, which does not change,\nand where there is no sight of what you were, you look at Christ, and call His\nwitnesses to shine on you, BECAUSE YOU CALLED THEM FORTH. And THEY will not deny\nthe truth in you, because you looked for it in them, and FOUND it there.\n\nNow is the time for salvation, for NOW is the release from time. Reach\nout to all your brothers, and touch them with the touch of Christ. In timeless\nunion WITH them is YOUR continuity, unbroken because it is wholly shared. God's\nguiltless Son is ONLY light. There is no darkness in him ANYWHERE, for he is\nwhole.\nCall all your brothers to witness to his wholeness, as I am calling you to join\nwith me. Every voice has a part in the song of redemption, the hymn of gladness\nand thanksgiving for the light, to the Creator of Light. The holy light that\nshines forth from God's Son is the witness that his light is of his Father.\n\nShine on your brothers in remembrance of your Creator, and you WILL\nremember Him, as you call forth the witnesses to His creation. Those whom you\nheal bear witness to YOUR healing, for in THEIR wholeness you will see your own.\nAnd as your hymns of praise and gladness rise to your Creator, He will return\nyour thanks, in His clear answer to your call. For it can never be that His Son\ncalled upon Him, and remained unanswered. His call to you is but your call to\nHim. And in Him you are answered by His peace.\n\nChildren of Light, you know not that the Light is in you. And you will\nfind it through its witnesses. For having given light to them, THEY WILL RETURN\nIT. Everyone you see IN light brings YOUR light closer to your OWN awareness.\nLove always leads to love. The sick, who ASK for love, are grateful for it, and\nin their joy, they shine with holy thanks. And this they offer you, who GAVE them\njoy. They are your guides to joy, for having received it OF you, they would keep\nit. You have established them as guides to peace, for you have made it manifest\nin them. And SEEING it, its beauty calls you home.\n\nThere is a light which this world cannot give. Yet YOU can give it, as\nit was given YOU. And AS you give it, it shines forth to call you FROM the world,\nand follow it. For this light\nwill attract you as nothing in this world can do. And you will lay aside the\nworld and find another. This other world is bright with love WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN\nIT. And here will everything remind you of your Father and his holy Son. Light is\nunlimited, and spreads across this world in quiet joy. All those you brought WITH\nyou will shine on you, and you will shine on them in gratitude, because they\nbrought you here. Your light will join with theirs, in power so compelling, that\nit will draw the others out of darkness as you look on them.\n\nAwaking unto Christ is following the laws of love OF YOUR FREE WILL,\nand out of quiet recognition of the truth in them. The attraction of light must\ndraw you willingly, and willingness is signified by GIVING. Those who accept love\nOF you, become your willing witnesses to the love you gave them, and it is THEY\nwho hold it out to YOU. In sleep you are alone, and your awareness is narrowed to\nyourself. And that is why the nightmares come. You dream of isolation, BECAUSE\nyour eyes are closed. You do not SEE your brothers, and, in the darkness, you\ncannot look upon the light you GAVE to them.\n\nAnd yet the laws of love are not suspended because you sleep. And you\nhave followed them through all your nightmares, and have been faithful in your\ngiving, for you were NOT alone. Even in sleep has Christ protected you, ensuring\nthe real world FOR you when you wake. In YOUR name He has given FOR you, and\ngiven YOU the gifts He gave. God's Son is still as loving as his Father.\nContinuous WITH his Father, he has no past APART from Him. So he has never ceased",

    "content": "Attainment of the Real World\n\nSit quietly and look upon the world you see, and tell yourself, “The\nreal world is not like this. It has no buildings, and there are no streets where\npeople walk alone and separately. There are no stores where people buy an endless\nlist of things they do not need. It is not lit with artificial light, and night\ncomes not upon it. There is no day that brightens and grows dim. There is no\nloss. Nothing is there but shines, and shines forever.” This world you see MUST\nBE DENIED, for sight of it is costing you a different kind of vision. YOU CANNOT\nSEE BOTH WORLDS, for each of them involves a different kind of seeing, and\ndepends on what you cherish. The sight of one is possible because you have denied\nthe other.\n\nBoth are not true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the\namount to which you hold it dear. And yet their power is NOT the same, because\ntheir real attraction to you is unequal. You do not really want the world you\nsee, for it has disappointed you since time began. The homes you built have never\nsheltered you. The roads you made have led you nowhere, and no city that you\nbuilt has withstood the crumbling assault of time. Nothing you made but has the\nmark of death upon it. Hold it not dear, for it is old and tired, and ready to\nreturn to dust, even as you made it.\n\nThis aching world has not the power to touch the living world at all.\nYou could not give it that, and so, although you turn in sadness from it, you\ncannot find in it the road that leads AWAY from it into another world. Yet the\nREAL world HAS the power to touch you even here BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT. And what you\ncall with love WILL come to you. LOVE ALWAYS ANSWERS, being unable to deny a call\nfor help, or not to hear the cries of pain that rise to it, from every part of\nthis strange world you made, but do not want. The only effort you need make, to\ngive this world away in glad exchange for what you did NOT make is willingness to\nlearn THE ONE YOU MADE IS FALSE.\n\nYou HAVE been wrong about the world, because you have misjudged\nYOURSELF. From such a twisted reference point, what COULD you see? All vision\nstarts WITH THE PERCEIVER, who judges what is true and what is false. And what he\njudges false, HE DOES NOT SEE. You who would judge reality CANNOT see it, for\nwhenever judgment enters, reality has slipped away. The out of mind is out of\nsight, because what is denied is THERE, but is not recognized. Christ is still\nthere, although you know Him not. His Being does NOT depend upon your\nrecognition. He lives within you in the quiet present, and waits for you to leave\nthe past behind, and enter into the world He holds out to you in love.\n\nNo-one in this distracted world but has not seen some glimpses of the\nother world about him. But while he still lays value on his own, he will DENY the\nvision of the other world, maintaining that he loves WHAT HE LOVES NOT, and\nfollowing not the road that love points out. Love leads so gladly! And as you\nfollow Him, YOU will rejoice that you have found His company, and learned of Him\nthe joyful journey home. You wait but for YOURSELF. To give this sad world over,\nand exchange your errors for the peace of God, is but YOUR will. And Christ will\nALWAYS offer you the Will of God, in recognition that you share it WITH Him.\n\nIt is God's Will that nothing touch His Son except Himself, and\nnothing else comes nigh unto him. He is as safe from pain as God Himself, Who\nwatches over him in everything. The world about him shines with love, because God\nplaced him in Himself where pain is not, and love surrounds him without end or\nflaw. Disturbance of his peace can never be. In perfect sanity he looks on love,\nfor it is all about him, and within him. He MUST deny the world of pain, the\ninstant he perceives the arms of love around him. And from this point of safety,\nhe looks quietly about him, and recognizes that the world is one with him.\n\nThe peace of God passeth your understanding ONLY in the past. Yet\nhere it IS, and you CAN understand it NOW. God loves His Son forever, and His Son\nRETURNS his Father's love forever. The real world is the way that leads you to\nremembrance of this one thing that is wholly true, and wholly YOURS. For all else\nyou have LENT yourself in time, and it WILL fade. But this one thing is ALWAYS\nyours, being the gift of God unto His Son. Your ONE reality was GIVEN you, and BY\nit God created you as one with Him.\n\nYou will first DREAM of peace, and THEN awaken to it. Your first\nexchange of what you made for what, you want is the exchange of nightmares for\nthe happy dreams of love. In these lie your true perceptions, for the Holy Spirit\ncorrects the world of dreams, where ALL perception is. Knowledge needs NO\ncorrection. Yet the dreams of love lead UNTO knowledge. In them you see nothing\nfearful, and BECAUSE of this they are the welcome that you OFFER knowledge. Love\nwaits on welcome, NOT on time, and the real world is but your welcome of what\nalways was. Therefore the call of joy is in it, and your glad response is your\nawakening to what you have NOT lost. Praise, then, the Father for the perfect\nsanity of His most holy Son.\n\nYour Father knoweth that you have need of nothing. In Heaven this is\nso, for what could you need in eternity? In YOUR world you DO need things,\nbecause it is a world of scarcity in which you find yourself BECAUSE you are\nlacking. But CAN you find yourself in such a world? Without the Holy Spirit, the\nanswer would be no. But BECAUSE of Him, the answer is a joyous YES. As mediator\nbetween the two worlds, He knows what you have need of, and WHICH WILL NOT HURT\nYOU. Ownership is a dangerous concept, if it is left to you. The ego wants to\nHAVE things for salvation, for possession is its law. Possession for its OWN sake\nis the ego's fundamental creed, a basic cornerstone in the churches that it\nbuilds unto itself. And at ITS altar, it demands you lay ALL of the things it\nbids you get, leaving you no joy in them.\n\nEVERYTHING that the ego tells you that you need will hurt you. For,\nalthough it urges you again and again to GET, it LEAVES you nothing, for what you\nget it will DEMAND of you. And even from the very hands that grasped it, it will\nbe wrenched and hurled into the dust. For where the ego sees salvation IT SEES\nSEPARATION, and so you lose whatever you have gotten in its name. Therefore, ask\nnot of yourselves what you need, FOR YOU KNOW NOT, and your advice unto yourself\nWILL hurt you. For what YOU think you need will merely serve to tighten up your\nworld AGAINST the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this\nworld can REALLY hold for you.\n\nOnly the Holy Spirit KNOWS what you need. For HE will give you all\nthings that do NOT block the way to light. And what else COULD you need? In time,\nHe gives you all the things that you need have, and will renew them as long as\nyou have need of them. He will take nothing FROM you, as long as you have ANY\nneed of it. And yet He knows that EVERYTHING you need is temporary, and need but\nlast until you step aside from ALL your needs, and learn that all of them HAVE\nBEEN fulfilled. Therefore, He has no investment in the things that He supplies,\nexcept to make certain that you will NOT use them on behalf of lingering in time.\nHe knows that you are not at home there, and He wills no delay to wait upon your\njoyous homecoming.\n\nLeave, then, your needs to Him. He will supply them, with no\nemphasis at all upon them. What comes to you of Him comes safely, for He will\nensure it never can become a dark spot, hidden in your mind, and kept to hurt\nyou. Under His guidance, you will travel light and journey lightly, for His sight\nis ever on the journey's end, which is His goal. God's Son is not a traveler\nthrough OUTER worlds. However holy his perception may become, no world OUTSIDE\nhimself holds his inheritance. Within HIMSELF he HAS no needs, for light needs\nnothing but to shine in peace. And from ITSELF, to let the rays extend in quiet\nto infinity.\n\nWhenever you are tempted to undertake a foolish journey that would\nlead AWAY from light, remember what you REALLY want, and say, “The Holy Spirit\nleads me unto Christ, and where else would I go? What need have I but to awake in Him?”\nThen follow Him in joy, with faith that He will lead you safely through all the\ndangers to your peace of mind that this world sets before you. Kneel not before\nthe altars to sacrifice, and seek not what you will surely lose. Content\nyourselves with what you will as surely KEEP, and be not restless, for you\nundertake a quiet journey to the peace of God, where He would have you be in\nquietness.\n\nIn me, you have ALREADY overcome EVERY temptation that would hold you\nback. We walk together on the way to quietness that is the gift of God. Hold me\ndear, for what EXCEPT your brothers CAN you need? We will restore to you the\npeace of mind that we MUST find together. The Holy Spirit will teach you to\nawaken unto us, and to yourself. THIS is the only REAL need to be fulfilled in\ntime. Salvation FROM the world lies ONLY here. My peace I GIVE you. TAKE it of\nme, in glad exchange for all the world has offered but to TAKE AWAY. And we will\nspread it, like a veil of light, across the world's sad face, in which we hide\nour brothers FROM the world, and it from them.\n\nWe cannot sing redemption's hymn alone. My task is not completed 'til\nI have lifted every voice with mine. And yet it is NOT mine, for as it is my gift\nto you, so was it the Father's gift to me, given me through His Spirit. The sound\nof it will banish sorrow from the mind of God's most holy Son, where it cannot\nabide. Healing in time IS needed, for joy cannot establish its eternal reign\nwhere sorrow dwells. You dwell not here, but in eternity. You travel but in\ndreams, while safe at home. Give thanks to every part of you that you have taught\nhow to REMEMBER you. Thus does the Son of God give thanks unto his Father for his\npurity.",

HE TEACHES THAT THE PAST DOES NOT EXIST, a fact which\nbelongs to the sphere of knowledge, and which therefore NO-ONE IN THE WORLD\nKNOWS. It would indeed be impossible to BE in the world with this knowledge. For\nthe mind that knows this unequivocally, knows also that it dwells in eternity,\nand utilizes no perception at all. It therefore does not consider WHERE it is,\nbecause the concept “where” does not mean anything to it. It knows that it is\nEVERYWHERE, just as it has EVERYTHING and FOREVER.\n\nThe very real difference between perception and knowledge becomes\nquite apparent, if you consider this: there is NOTHING partial about knowledge.\nEvery aspect is whole, and therefore NO ASPECT IS SEPARATE. YOU are an aspect of\nknowledge, being in the Mind of God, Who KNOWS you. All knowledge MUST be yours,\nfor in you IS all knowledge. Perception, at its loftiest, is NEVER complete.

    "content": "The Role of Healing\n\nPerfect perception, then, has many elements IN COMMON with knowledge,\nmaking transfer TO it possible. Yet the last step must be taken by God, because\nthe last step in your redemption, which SEEMS to be in the future, WAS\naccomplished by God in your creation. The separation has NOT interrupted it.\nCreation cannot BE interrupted. The separation is merely a faulty formulation of\nreality, WITH NO EFFECT AT ALL. The miracle, without a function in Heaven, IS\nneedful here. ASPECTS of reality can still be seen, and they will replace aspects\nof UNREALITY. Aspects of reality can be seen IN EVERYTHING and EVERYWHERE. Yet\nonly God can gather them together by crowning them AS ONE with the final gift of\neternity.\n\nApart from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit has no function. He\nis not separate from either, being in the mind of both, and knowing that Mind is\none. He is a thought of God, and God has GIVEN Him to you, because He has NO\nthoughts He does not share. His message speaks of timelessness in time, and that\nis why Christ's vision looks on everything with love. Yet even Christ's vision is\nnot His reality. The golden ASPECTS of reality, which spring to light under His\nloving gaze, are partial glimpses of the Heaven that lies beyond them.\n\nThis is the miracle of creation; THAT IT IS ONE FOREVER. Every miracle\nyou offer to the Son of God, is but the true perception of one ASPECT of the\nwhole. Though every aspect IS the whole, you cannot KNOW this, until you SEE that\nevery aspect IS THE SAME, perceived in the SAME light; and THEREFORE one.\nEveryone seen WITHOUT the past thus brings you nearer to the end of time, by\nbringing healed and healing sight into the darkness, and ENABLING THE WORLD TO\nSEE. For light must come into the darkened world, to make Christ's vision\npossible even here. Help Him to give His gift of light to all who think they\nwander in the darkness, and let Him gather them into His quiet sight that makes\nthem one.\n\nThey are all the same; all beautiful, and equal in their holiness. And\nHe will offer them unto His Father, as they were offered unto Him. There is ONE\nmiracle, as there is ONE reality. And every miracle you do contains them all, as\nevery aspect of reality you see blends quietly into the one reality of God. The\nonly miracle that ever was, is God's most holy Son, created in the One Reality\nthat is his Father. Christ's vision is His gift to you. His Being is His Father's\ngift to Him.\n\nBe you content with healing, for Christ's gift you CAN bestow, and\nyour Father's gift you CANNOT lose. Offer Christ's gift to everyone and\neverywhere. For miracles, offered the Son of God through the Holy Spirit, attune\nYOU to reality. The Holy Spirit knows your part in the redemption, and who are\nseeking you, and where to find them. Knowledge is far beyond your individual\nconcern. You who are part of it, and all of it, need only realize that it is of\nthe Father, NOT of you. Your role in the redemption LEADS you to it, by reestablishing\nits oneness in your minds.\n\nWhen you have seen your brothers as yourself, you will be RELEASED to\nknowledge, having learned to FREE yourself, of Him who knows of freedom. Unite\nwith me, under the holy banner of His teaching, and, as we grow in strength, the\npower of God's Son will move in us, and we will leave no-one untouched and no-one\nleft alone. And suddenly, time will be over, and we will all unite in the\nEternity of God the Father. The holy light you saw OUTSIDE yourself, in every\nmiracle you offered to your brothers, will be RETURNED to you. And, KNOWING that\nthe light is IN you, YOUR creations will be there WITH you, as you are in your\nFather.\n\nAs miracles in this world join you to your brothers, so do your\ncreations establish your fatherhood in Heaven. YOU are the witnesses to the\nFatherhood of God, and He has given you the power to create the witnesses to\nYOURS, which is as HIS. Deny a brother here, and you deny the witnesses to your\nfatherhood in Heaven. The miracle which God created is perfect, as are the\nmiracles which YOU created in His Name. They need no healing, nor do you, when\nyou know THEM.\n\nBut in this world, your perfection is unwitnessed. God knows it, but\nYOU do not, and so you do not SHARE His witness TO it. Nor do you witness unto\nHim, for reality is witnessed to as one. God waits your witness to His Son, and\nto Himself. The miracles you do on earth are lifted up to Heaven, and to Him.",

    "content": "The Shadow of Guilt\n\nGuilt remains the only thing that hides the Father, FOR GUILT IS THE\nATTACK UPON HIS SON. The guilty ALWAYS condemn, and HAVING done so, they WILL\ncondemn, linking the future to the past, as is the ego's law. Fidelity unto this\nlaw lets no light in, for it DEMANDS fidelity to darkness, and FORBIDS awakening.\nThe ego's laws are strict, and breaches are severely punished. Therefore, give no\nobedience to its laws, for they ARE laws of punishment. And those who follow them\nbelieve that THEY are guilty, and so they MUST condemn. Between the future and\nthe past, the laws of God must intervene, if you would free yourselves. Atonement\nstands between them, like a lamp that shines so brightly, that the chain of\ndarkness, in which you bound yourselves will disappear.\n\nRelease from guilt is the ego's whole undoing. MAKE NO-ONE FEARFUL,\nfor his guilt is yours, and, by obeying the ego's harsh commandments, you bring\nits condemnation on yourself, and you will not escape the punishment it offers\nthose who obey it. The ego rewards fidelity to it with pain, for faith in it IS\npain. And faith can be rewarded only in terms of the belief in which the faith\nwas placed. Faith MAKES the power of belief, and WHERE it is invested, determines\nits reward. For faith is ALWAYS given what is treasured, and what is treasured IS\nreturned to you.\n\nThe world can give you ONLY what you gave it, for being nothing but\nyour own projection, it HAS no meaning apart from what you found in it, and\nplaced your faith in. Be faithful unto darkness, and you will NOT see, because\nyour faith WILL be rewarded as you GAVE it. You WILL accept your treasure,\nand if you place your faith in the past, the future WILL be like it. Whate'er you\nhold as dear YOU THINK IS YOURS. The power of your VALUING will make it so.\n\nAtonement brings a re-evaluation of EVERYTHING you cherish, for it is\nthe means by which the Holy Spirit can SEPARATE the false and true, which you\nhave accepted into your minds WITHOUT DISTINCTION. Therefore, you cannot value\none without the other, and guilt has become AS TRUE FOR YOU AS INNOCENCE. You do\nNOT believe the Son of God is guiltless, because you see the past, and see HIM\nnot. When you condemn a brother, you are saying, “I who WAS guilty choose to\nREMAIN so.” You have denied HIS freedom, and by so doing, you have denied the\nwitness unto YOURS. You could as easily have FREED him from the past, and lifted\nfrom his mind the cloud of guilt that binds him TO it. And in HIS freedom would\nhave been your OWN.\n\nLay not his guilt upon him, for HIS guilt lies in his secret that HE\nthinks that HE has done this unto YOU. Would you then teach him that he is RIGHT\nin his delusion? The idea that the guiltless Son of God can attack himself, and\nMAKE him guilty, IS insane. In ANY form, in ANYONE, BELIEVE THIS NOT. For sin and\ncondemnation are the same, and the belief in one is faith in the other, calling\nfor punishment INSTEAD of love. NOTHING can justify insanity, and to call for\npunishment UPON YOURSELF, MUST be insane.\n\nSee no-one, then, as guilty, and you will affirm the truth of\nguiltlessness UNTO YOURSELF. In every condemnation that you offer the Son of God,\nlies the conviction of your OWN guilt.\nIf you would have the Holy Spirit make YOU free of it, accept His offer of\nAtonement for ALL your brothers. For so you learn that IT IS TRUE FOR YOU.\nRemember always that it is impossible to condemn the Son of God IN PART. Those\nwhom you see as guilty, become the witnesses to guilt IN YOU, and you WILL see it\nthere, for it IS there, until it is undone. Guilt is ALWAYS in your OWN mind,\nWHICH HAS CONDEMNED ITSELF. Project it not, for while you do, it cannot BE\nundone. With everyone whom you release from guilt, great is the joy in Heaven,\nwhere the witnesses to your fatherhood rejoice.\n\nGUILT MAKES YOU BLIND. For while you see one spot of guilt within you,\nYOU WILL NOT SEE THE LIGHT. And by projecting it, the WORLD seems dark, and\nshrouded in your guilt. You throw a dark veil over it, and cannot see it, BECAUSE\nYOU CANNOT LOOK WITHIN. You are afraid of what you would see there, but it is NOT\nthere. THE THING YOU FEAR IS GONE. If you would look within, you would see only\nthe Atonement, shining in quiet and in peace, upon the altar to your Father. Do\nnot be afraid to look within. The ego tells you all is black with guilt within\nyou, and bids you NOT TO LOOK. Instead, it bids you look upon your brothers, AND\nSEE THE GUILT IN THEM.\n\nYet this you cannot do, WITHOUT REMAINING BLIND. For those who see\ntheir brothers dark, and guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too\nafraid to look upon the light within. Within you is NOT what you believe is\nthere, and what YOU put your faith in. Within you is the holy sign of perfect\nfaith YOUR FATHER has in you. HE does not value you as you do. He knows Himself,\nand knows the truth IN YOU. He knows THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE, for He knows not of\ndifferences. Can YOU see guilt where God KNOWS there is perfect innocence? You\ncan DENY His knowledge, but you CANNOT change it. Look, then, upon the light He\nplaced within you, and learn that what you feared was there HAS BEEN replaced\nwith love.",

    "content": "Release and Restoration\n\nYou are accustomed to the notion that the mind can see the source of\npain where it is not. The doubtful service of displacement is to hide the REAL\nsource of your guilt, and KEEP from your awareness the full perception THAT IT IS\nINSANE. Displacement ALWAYS is maintained by the illusion that the source, from\nwhich attention is diverted, MUST BE TRUE. And MUST BE FEARFUL, or you would not\nhave displaced the guilt onto what you believed to be LESS fearful. You are\ntherefore willing, with little opposition, to look upon all sorts of “sources”\nunderneath awareness, provided that they are not the deeper source, to which they\nbear no real relationship at all. Insane ideas HAVE no real relationships, for\nthat is why they ARE insane.\n\nNo real relationship can rest on guilt, or even hold one spot of it,\nto mar its purity. For all relationships which guilt has touched, are used but to\navoid the person AND the guilt. What strange relationships you have made for this\nstrange purpose! And you forgot that real relationships are holy, and cannot be\nused by YOU at all. They are used ONLY by the Holy Spirit, and it is that that\nMAKES them pure. If you displace YOUR guilt upon them, the Holy Spirit cannot use\nthem. For, by pre-empting FOR YOUR OWN ends what you should have given HIM, he\ncannot use them unto YOUR release. No-one who would unite in ANY way, with\nANYONE, for his OWN salvation will find it in that strange relationship. It is\nnot shared, and so it is not real.\n\nIn any union with a brother, in which you seek to lay YOUR guilt upon\nhim, or share it WITH him, or perceive his own, YOU WILL FEEL GUILTY. Nor will\nyou find satisfaction and peace with him, because your union with him IS NOT\nREAL. You will see guilt in that relationship, BECAUSE YOU PUT IT THERE. It is\ninevitable that those who suffer guilt WILL attempt to displace it, because they\nDO believe in it. Yet, though they suffer, they will not look within, AND LET IT\nGO. They cannot know they love, and cannot understand WHAT LOVING IS. Their main\nconcern is to perceive the source of guilt\nOUTSIDE themselves, BEYOND their own control.\n\nWhen you maintain that YOU are guilty, but the source LIES IN THE\nPAST, you are NOT looking inward. The past is NOT in you. Your weird associations\nto it HAVE no meaning in the present. Yet you let them stand BETWEEN you and your\nbrothers, with whom you find no REAL relationships at all. Can you EXPECT to use\nyour brothers as a means to solve the past, and still to see them as they really\nARE? Salvation is not found by those who use their brothers to resolve problems\nWHICH ARE NOT THERE. You wanted not salvation in the past. Would you impose your\nidle wishes on the present, and hope to find salvation NOW?\n\nDetermine, then, to be NOT as you were. Use no relationship to hold\nyou to the past, but with each one, each day, be born again. A minute, even less,\nwill be enough to free you from the past, and give your mind in peace over to the\nAtonement. When everyone is welcome to you as you would have YOURSELF be welcome\nto your Father, you will see no guilt in you. For you will have ACCEPTED the\nAtonement, which shone within you all the while you dreamed of guilt, and would\nnot look within and SEE it.\n\nAs long as you believe that guilt is justified in ANY way, in ANYONE,\nWHATEVER he may do, you will not look within, where you would ALWAYS find\nAtonement. The end of guilt will never come as long as you believe THERE IS A\nREASON FOR IT. For you must learn that guilt is ALWAYS totally insane, and HAS no\nreason. The Holy Spirit seeks not to dispel REALITY. If GUILT were real,\nATONEMENT would not be. The purpose of Atonement is to dispel illusions, NOT to\nestablish them as real, and THEN forgive them. The Holy Spirit does not KEEP\nillusions in your mind to frighten you, and show them to you fearfully, to\ndemonstrate what He has saved you FROM.\n\nWHAT HE HAS SAVED YOU FROM IS GONE. Give NO reality to guilt, and see\nNO reason for it. The Holy Spirit does what God would have Him do, and has ALWAYS\ndone so. He has SEEN separation, but KNOWS of union. He TEACHES healing, but He\nalso KNOWS of creation. He would have you see and teach as He does, and through\nHim. But what He knows, you do NOT know, though it is yours. NOW it is given you\nto heal and teach, to make what WILL BE, now. As yet it is NOT now. The Son of\nGod believes that he is lost in guilt, alone in a dark world, where pain is\npressing everywhere upon him, FROM WITHOUT. When he has looked within, and seen\nthe radiance there, he will remember how much his Father loves him. And it will\nseem incredible that he had ever thought his Father loved him not, and looked\nupon him as condemned.\n\nThe moment that you realize GUILT IS INSANE, WHOLLY unjustified, and\nWHOLLY without reason, you will NOT fear to look upon Atonement, and ACCEPT IT\nWHOLLY. You who have been unmerciful unto yourselves, do not remember your\nFather's love. And, looking without mercy upon your brothers, you do not remember\nhow much YOU love HIM. Yet it is forever true. In shining peace within you, is\nthe perfect purity in which you were created. Fear not to look upon the lovely\ntruth in you. Look THROUGH the cloud of guilt that dims your vision, and look\nPAST darkness, to the holy place where you will see the light.\n\nThe altar to your Father is as pure as He Who raised it to Himself.\nNothing can keep FROM you what Christ would have you see. His will is like His\nFather's, and He offers mercy to every Child of God, as He would have YOU do.\nRELEASE from guilt, as you would BE released. There is no other way to look\nwithin, and see the light of love shining as steadily, and as surely, as God\nHimself has always loved His Son. AND AS HIS SON LOVES HIM. There is no fear in\nlove, for love is guiltless. You who have ALWAYS loved your Father can have no\nfear, for ANY reason, to look within, and see your holiness.\n\nYou CANNOT be as you believed you WERE. Your guilt is without reason,\nbecause it is not in the Mind of God, where YOU are. And this IS reason, which the Holy Spirit would RESTORE to you. He would remove ONLY\nillusions. All else He would have you see. And in Christ's vision He would show\nyou the perfect purity that is forever within God's Son. You cannot enter into\nREAL relationship with ANY of God's Sons, unless you love them all, and EQUALLY.\nLove is not special. If you single out PART of the Sonship for your love, you are\nimposing guilt on ALL your relationships, and MAKING them unreal.\n\nYou can love ONLY as God loves. Seek not to love UNLIKE Him, for there\nIS no love apart from His. Until you recognize that this is true, you will have\nno idea WHAT LOVE IS LIKE. No-one who condemns a brother, can see HIMSELF as\nguiltless in the peace of God. If he IS guiltless and in peace, AND SEES IT NOT,\nhe IS delusional, and has NOT looked upon himself. To him I say, “Behold the Son\nof God, and look upon his purity, and be still. In quiet, look upon his holiness,\nand offer thanks unto his Father, that no guilt has ever touched him.”\n\nNo illusion that you have ever held against him, has touched his\ninnocence in any way. His shining purity, wholly untouched by guilt, and wholly\nloving, is bright within you. Let us look upon him together, and love him. For in\nour love of him IS your guiltlessness. But look upon yourself, and gladness and\nappreciation for what you will see, will banish guilt forever. I thank You,\nFather, for the purity of Your most holy Son, whom Thou hast created guiltless\nforever.\n\nLike you, my faith and my belief are centered on what I treasure. The\ndifference is that I love ONLY what God loves WITH me, and, because of this, I\ntreasure you beyond the value that you set on yourselves, even unto the worth\nthat God has placed upon you. I love all that He created. And all my faith and my\nbelief I offer unto it. My faith in you is strong as all the love I give my\nFather. My trust in you is without limit, and without the fear that you will hear\nme not. I thank the Father for your loveliness, and for the many gifts that you\nwill let me offer to the Kingdom, in honor of its wholeness that is of God.\n\nPraise be unto you, who make the Father One with His Own Son. Alone we\nare all lowly, but together, we shine with brightness so intense, that none of us\nalone can even think on it. Before the glorious radiance of the Kingdom, guilt\nmelts away, and, transformed into kindness, will never more be what it was. Every\nreaction that you experience will be so purified, that it is fitting as a hymn of\npraise unto your Father. See only praise of Him in what He has created, for He\nwill never cease His praise of YOU. United in this praise, we stand before the\ngates of Heaven, where we will surely enter, in our blamelessness. God loves you.\nCould I, then, lack faith in you, and love Him perfectly?\n\nForgetfullness and sleep, and even death, become the ego's best advice\nfor how to deal with the perceived and harsh intrusion of guilt on peace. Yet no one\nsees himself in conflict, and ravaged by a cruel war, unless he believes that\nBOTH “opponents” in the war are real. Believing this, he must escape, for such a\nwar would surely end his peace of mind, and so destroy him. But if he could but\nrealize the war is between forces that are real and UNREAL powers, he could look\nupon himself, and SEE his freedom. No-one finds himself ravaged and torn in\nendless battles, which he HIMSELF perceives as wholly without meaning.\n\nGod would not have His Son embattled, and so His Son's imagined\n“enemy,” which he made, is TOTALLY unreal. You are but trying to escape a bitter\nwar from which you HAVE escaped. The war is gone. For you have heard the hymn of\nfreedom, rising unto Heaven. Gladness and joy belong to God for your release,\nbecause YOU made it not. But, as you made not freedom, so you made not a war that\ncould ENDANGER freedom. Nothing destructive ever was, or will be. The war, the\nguilt, the past, are gone as one, into the unreality from whence they came.",

It is WHOLLY of value. It can\nmerely be appreciated OR NOT. To value it partially is NOT TO KNOW ITS VALUE. In\nHeaven is everything God values, and nothing else. Heaven is perfectly\nunambiguous. Everything is clear and bright, and calls forth ONE response. There\nis no darkness, and there is no contrast. There is no variation. There is no\ninterruption. There is a sense of peace so deep, that no dream in this world has\never brought even a dim imagining of what it is.\n\nNothing in this world can give this peace, for nothing in this world\nis wholly shared. Perfect perception can merely show you what is CAPABLE of being\nwholly shared. It can also show you the RESULTS of sharing, while you still\nremember the results of NOT sharing. The Holy Spirit points quietly to the\ncontrast, knowing that you will finally let Him judge the difference FOR you,\nallowing Him to demonstrate which MUST be true. He has perfect faith in your\nfinal judgment because He knows that HE WILL MAKE IT FOR YOU. To doubt this would\nbe to doubt that His mission will be fulfilled. How is this possible, when His\nmission is of God?\n\nYou whose minds are darkened by doubt and guilt, remember this; God\ngave the Holy Spirit TO you, and gave HIM the mission to REMOVE all doubt, and\nevery trace of guilt, that His dear Son has laid upon himself. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE\nTHAT THIS MISSION FAIL.\nNothing can prevent what God would HAVE accomplished from accomplishment.\nWhatever your reactions to the Holy Spirit's voice may be, whatever voice you\nchoose to listen to, whatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God's Will IS\ndone. You WILL find the peace in which He has established you, because HE does\nNOT change His Mind. He is invariable as the peace in which you dwell, and of\nwhich the Holy Spirit reminds you.\n\nYou will not remember change and shift in Heaven. You have need of\ncontrast only here. Contrast and differences are necessary teaching aids, for by\nthem you learn what to avoid, and what to seek. When you have LEARNED this, you\nwill find the answer that makes the need for ANY differences disappear. Truth\ncomes of its OWN will, unto its own. When you have learned that you BELONG to\ntruth, it will flow lightly over you, without a difference of ANY kind. For you\nwill NEED no contrast to help you realize that THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, and ONLY\nthis.\n\nFear not the Holy Spirit will fail in what your Father has given Him\nto do. THE WILL OF GOD CAN FAIL IN NOTHING. Have faith in only this one thing,\nand it will be sufficient; God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you\nFROM it, or IT from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your\nblackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God\nwills for you. The Holy Spirit WILL restore your sanity, because insanity is NOT\nthe Will of God. If that suffices Him, it is enough for you. You will NOT keep\nwhat God would have removed, because it breaks communication with you, with whom\nHe would communicate. His voice WILL be heard.\n\nThe communication link which God Himself placed within you, joining\nyour minds with His, CANNOT be broken. You may believe you WANT it broken, and\nthis belief DOES interfere with the deep peace, in which the sweet and constant\ncommunication which God would SHARE with you, is known. Yet His channels of\nreaching out CANNOT be wholly closed, and separated FROM Him. Peace will be\nyours, because His peace still flows to you, from Him Whose Will IS peace. YOU\nHAVE IT NOW. The Holy Spirit will teach you how to USE it, and by PROJECTING it,\nto learn that it IS in you.\n\nGod willed you Heaven, and will ALWAYS will you nothing else. The Holy\nSpirit knows ONLY of His Will. There is NO chance that Heaven will not be yours,\nfor God is sure, and what He wills is sure as He is. You will learn salvation,\nbecause you will learn HOW TO SAVE. It will not be possible to EXEMPT YOURSELF\nfrom what the Holy Spirit wills to teach you. Salvation is as sure as God. His\ncertainty suffices. Learn that even the darkest nightmare that disturbed the mind\nof God's sleeping Son, holds no power over him. He WILL learn the lesson of\nawaking. God watches over him, and light surrounds him.\n\nCan God's Son lose himself in dreams, when God has placed WITHIN him\nthe glad call to awaken and be glad? He cannot separate himself from what is IN\nhim. His sleep will not withstand the call to wake. The mission of redemption\nwill be fulfilled, as surely as the Creation will remain unchanged throughout\nEternity. You do NOT have to know that Heaven is yours, to MAKE it so. It IS so.\nBut the will of God must be accepted AS your will, to KNOW it. The Holy Spirit\nCANNOT fail to undo FOR you everything\nthat you have learned, that teaches you what is NOT true must be RECONCILED with\ntruth. This is the reconciliation which the ego would substitute for your\nreconciliation unto sanity and unto peace.\n\nThe Holy Spirit has a very different kind of reconciliation in His\nmind for you, and one which HE WILL EFFECT, as surely as the ego will NOT effect\nwhat it attempts. Failure is of the ego, NOT of God. From Him you CANNOT wander,\nand there is no possibility that the plan the Holy Spirit offers to everyone, for\nthe salvation OF everyone, will not be perfectly accomplished. You WILL be\nreleased, and you will NOT remember anything you made that was not created FOR",

    "content": "The Testimony of Miracles\n\nYes, you are blessed indeed. But in this world, you do not know it.\nYet you have the means for LEARNING it, and SEEING it quite clearly. The Holy\nSpirit uses logic as easily, and as well, as does the ego, except that HIS\nconclusions are NOT insane. They take a direction EXACTLY opposite, pointing as\nclearly to Heaven as the ego points to darkness and to death. We have followed\nmuch of the ego's logic, and have seen its logical conclusions. And HAVING seen\nthem, we have realized that they can NOT be seen but in delusions. For there\nalone their SEEMING clearness SEEMS TO BE CLEARLY SEEN. Let us now turn AWAY from\nthem, and follow the simple logic, by which the Holy Spirit teaches you the\nsimple conclusions that speak for truth, and ONLY truth.\n\nIf you are blessed and do not know it, you need to learn it MUST be\nso. The KNOWLEDGE is not taught, but its conditions MUST be acquired, for it is\nTHEY that have been thrown away. You CAN LEARN to bless, and CANNOT give WHAT YOU\nHAVE NOT. If, then, you OFFER blessing, it MUST have come FIRST TO YOURSELF. And\nyou must also have ACCEPTED IT AS YOURS, for how else could you GIVE IT AWAY?\nThis is WHY your miracles offer YOU the testimony that YOU are blessed. If what\nyou offer IS complete forgiveness, you MUST have LET GUILT GO, accepting the\nAtonement for yourself, and learning you ARE guiltless. How could you learn what\nhas been done for you, BUT WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW, unless you do what you would\nHAVE to do, if it HAD BEEN done unto you?\n\nINDIRECT proof of truth is needed in a world made of denial, and\nwithout direction. You will perceive the need for this, if you will realize that\nto DENY is the decision NOT to know. The logic of the world MUST therefore lead\nto nothing, for its GOAL is nothing. If you decide to have and give and BE\nnothing except a dream, you MUST direct your thoughts unto oblivion. And if you\nhave and give and are EVERYTHING, and ALL THIS HAS BEEN DENIED, your thought\nsystem is closed off, and wholly separated from the truth.\nThis IS an insane world, and do not underestimate the actual extent of its\ninsanity. There is no area of your perception that it has not touched, and your\ndream IS sacred to you.\n\nThat is why God placed the Holy Spirit IN you, where YOU placed the\ndream. Seeing is ALWAYS outward. Were your thoughts wholly of YOU, the thought system\nwhich YOU have made, WOULD be forever dark. The thoughts which the mind of\nGod's Son projects, HAVE all the power that he gives them. The thoughts he shares\nwith God are BEYOND his belief, but those HE made ARE his beliefs. And it is\nTHESE, and NOT the truth, that he has chosen to defend and love. They will not be\ntaken from him. But they CAN be given up BY him, for the Source of their undoing\nis IN him. There is NOTHING in the world to teach him that the logic of the world\nis totally insane, and leads to nothing. But in him who MADE this insane logic,\nthere is One Who KNOWS it leads to nothing, for He knows of EVERYTHING.\n\nAny direction which will lead you where the Holy Spirit leads you NOT,\ngoes nowhere. Anything you deny, which He knows to be true, you have denied\nYOURSELF, and He must therefore teach you NOT to deny it. Undoing IS indirect, as\nDOING is. You were created ONLY to create, neither to see NOR do. These are but\nINDIRECT expressions of the will to live, which has been blocked by the\ncapricious and unholy whim of death and murder, that your Father shared not WITH\nyou. You have set yourselves the task of sharing what can NOT be shared. And\nwhile you think it possible to LEARN to do this, you will NOT believe all that IS\npossible to learn to do.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, therefore, must begin His teaching, by showing you\nwhat you can NEVER learn. His MESSAGE is not indirect, but He must introduce the\nsimple truth into a thought-system which has become so\ntwisted and so complex, that you CANNOT SEE that it means nothing. HE merely\nlooks at its foundation, and DISMISSES it. But YOU, who CANNOT undo what you have\nmade, nor escape the heavy burden of it's dullness that lies upon your minds,",

    "content": "The Happy Learner\n\nThe Holy Spirit needs a happy learner, in whom His mission can be\nhappily accomplished. You who are steadfastly devoted to misery, MUST first\nrecognize that you ARE miserable and NOT happy. The Holy Spirit cannot teach\nWITHOUT this contrast, for you believe that misery IS happiness. This has so\nconfused you, that you have undertaken to learn to do what you can NEVER do,\nbelieving that, UNLESS you learn it, you will NOT be happy. You do NOT realize\nthat the foundation on which this most peculiar learning goal depends, means\nABSOLUTELY NOTHING. This DOES make sense to you.\n\nHave faith in nothing, and you will FIND the treasure that you sought.\nBut you will add another burden to your mind, ALREADY burdened, or you would NOT\nhave sought another. You will believe that NOTHING IS OF VALUE, and will VALUE\nit. A little piece of glass, a speck of dust, a body, or a war, are one to you.\nFor if you value ONE thing made of nothing, you HAVE believed that nothing CAN be\nprecious, and that you CAN learn how to make the UNtrue true. The Holy Spirit,\nSEEING where you are, but KNOWING you are elsewhere, begins His lesson in\nsimplicity with the fundamental teaching that TRUTH IS TRUE. This is the hardest\nlesson you will ever learn, and in the end, the ONLY one.\n\nSimplicity is very difficult for twisted minds. Consider all the\ndistortions you have made of nothing; all the strange forms and feelings, and\nactions and reactions, that you have woven out of it. Nothing is so alien to you\nas the simple truth and nothing are you LESS inclined to listen to. The contrast\nbetween what is true, and what is not, is PERFECTLY apparent, yet you do NOT see\nit. The simple and the obvious are NOT apparent to those who would make palaces\nand royal robes of nothing, believing they are kings with golden crowns BECAUSE\nof them. All this the Holy Spirit sees, and teaches, simply, that ALL THIS IS NOT\nTRUE.\n\nTo these unhappy learners, who would teach themselves nothing, and\ndelude themselves into believing that it is NOT nothing, the Holy Spirit says,\nwith steadfast quietness, “The truth is true. Nothing else matters, nothing else\nis real, and EVERYTHING beside it is not there. Let Me make the one distinction\nFOR you, which you CANNOT make, but NEED to learn. Your faith in nothing IS\ndeceiving you. Offer your faith to Me, and I will place it gently in the holy\nplace where it belongs. You will find NO deception there, but only the simple\nTruth. And you will love it, because you will UNDERSTAND it.”\n\nLike you, the Holy Spirit did NOT make truth. Like God, He KNOWS it to\nbe true. He brings the LIGHT of truth into the darkness, and LETS it shine on\nyou. And as it shines, YOUR BROTHERS see it, and, realizing that this light is\nNOT what you have made, they see in you MORE than YOU see. They will be happy\nlearners of the lesson which this light brings to them, because it teaches them\nrelease from nothing, and from all the works of nothing. The heavy chains which\nSEEM to bind them unto despair, they do NOT see as nothing, until YOU bring the\nlight TO them. And THEN they see the chains have disappeared, and so they MUST\nhave been nothing.\n\nAnd YOU will see it WITH them. BECAUSE you taught them gladness and\nrelease, they will become YOUR teachers in release and gladness. When you teach\nANYONE that truth is true, YOU LEARN IT WITH HIM. And so you learn\nthat what seemed hardest was the easiest. Learn to be happy learners. You will\nNEVER learn how to make nothing everything. But see that this HAS BEEN your goal,\nand RECOGNIZE how foolish it has been. Be glad it is undone, for, when you look\nat it in simple honesty, it IS undone. We said before, “Be not content with\nnothing,” for you HAVE believed that nothing COULD content you. IT IS NOT SO.\n\nIf you would be a happy learner, you must give EVERYTHING that YOU\nhave learned over to the Holy Spirit, to be UNlearned FOR you. And THEN begin to\nlearn the joyous lessons that come quickly, on the firm foundation that truth is\ntrue. For what is builded there IS true, and BUILT on truth. The universe of\nlearning will open up before you, in all its gracious simplicity. With truth\nbefore you, you will not look back. The happy learner meets the conditions of\nlearning here, as he also meets the conditions of knowledge in the Kingdom.\n\nAll this lies in the Holy Spirit's plan to free you from the past, and\nopen up the way to freedom FOR you. For truth IS true. What else could ever be,\nor ever was? This simple lesson holds the key to the dark door, which you believe\nis locked forever. You MADE this door OF nothing, and behind it IS nothing. The\nkey is only the light which shines away the shapes and forms and fears of\nnothing. Accept this key to freedom, from the hands of Christ, Who gives it to\nyou, that you may join Him in the holy task of bringing light to darkness. For,\nlike your brothers, YOU do not realize the light has come, and freed you from the\nsleep of darkness.\n\nBehold your brothers in their freedom, and learn of them how to be\nFREE of darkness. The light in you will waken them, and they will not leave YOU\nasleep. The Vision of Christ is GIVEN, the very instant that it is perceived.\nWhere everything is clear, it is ALL holy. The quietness of its simplicity is so",

    "content": "The Decision for Guiltlessness\n\nLearning will be commensurate with motivation, and the interference in\nyour motivation for learning, is EXACTLY the same as that which interferes with\nALL your thinking. The happy learner CANNOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT LEARNING. This is\nso ESSENTIAL to learning, that it should never be forgotten. The guiltless\nlearner learns so easily, BECAUSE HIS THOUGHTS ARE FREE. But this entails the\nrecognition that GUILT IS INTERFERENCE, NOT SALVATION, and serves NO useful\nfunction at all.\n\nYou are accustomed to using guiltlessness merely to offset the pain of\nguilt, and do not look upon it as having value IN ITSELF. You believe that guilt\nAND guiltlessness are BOTH of value, each representing an ESCAPE from what the\nother does NOT offer you. You do NOT want either alone, for without both, you do\nnot see YOURSELVES as whole, and therefore happy. You are whole ONLY in your\nguiltlessness, and only in your guiltlessness, CAN you be happy. There IS no\nconflict here.\n\nTo wish for guilt in ANY way, in ANY form, will lost appreciation of\nthe value of your guiltlessness, and push it from your sight. There is NO\ncompromise that you can make with guilt, and escape from the pain which ONLY\nguiltlessness allays. Learning is living here, as creating is Being in Heaven.\nWhenever the pain of guilt seems to ATTRACT you, remember that, if you yield to\nit, you are deciding AGAINST your happiness, and will NOT learn how to be happy.\nSay, therefore, to yourself, gently, but with the conviction born of the love of\nGod and of His Son:\n\nWhat I experience I will make manifest.\n\nIf I am guiltless, I have nothing to fear.\n\nI choose to testify to my ACCEPTANCE of the Atonement,\n\nNOT FOR ITS REJECTION.\n\nI would accept my guiltlessness by making it manifest,\n\nand SHARING it.\n\nLet me bring peace to God's Son from his Father.\n\nEach day, each hour and minute, - even each second, - you are deciding\nbetween the crucifixion and the Resurrection; between the ego and the Holy\nSpirit. The ego is the choice for guilt, the Holy Spirit the decision for\nblamelessness. The power of decision is all that is yours. What you can decide\nBETWEEN is fixed, because there are no alternatives, EXCEPT truth and illusion.\nAnd there is no overlap between them, because they are opposites which CANNOT be\nreconciled, and CANNOT both be true. You are guilty OR guiltless, bound OR free,\nhappy OR unhappy.\n\nThe miracle teaches you that you have chosen guiltlessness, freedom,\nand joy. It is not a cause, but an EFFECT. It is the natural result of CHOOSING\nRIGHT, attesting to your happiness that comes from choosing to be FREE of guilt.\nEveryone you offer healing TO, returns it. Everyone you attack, KEEPS it and\ncherishes it, by holding it AGAINST you. Whether he DOES this, or does it not,\nwill make no difference. YOU WILL THINK HE DOES. It is impossible to offer WHAT\nYOU DO NOT WANT, without this penalty. The cost of giving IS receiving. Either it\nis a penalty from which you suffer, or the happy purchase of a treasure to hold\ndear.\n\nNo penalty is ever asked of God's Son, except BY himself and OF\nhimself. Every chance given to him to heal, is another opportunity to replace\ndarkness with light, and fear with love. If he refuses it, he binds himself TO\ndarkness because he did not choose to free his brother, and enter light WITH him.\nBy GIVING power to nothing, he threw away the joyous opportunity to learn that\nnothing HAS no power. And, by NOT DISPELLING, darkness, HE became afraid of\ndarkness AND of light. The joy of learning darkness has no power over the Son of\nGod, is the happy lesson the Holy Spirit teaches, and would have YOU teach WITH\nHim. It is HIS joy to teach it, as it will be YOURS.\n\nThe way to teach this simple lesson is merely this; guiltlessness IS\ninvulnerability. Therefore, make your INVULNERABILITY manifest to everyone, and\nteach him that, WHATEVER he may try to do to you, your perfect freedom from the\nbelief that you can BE harmed, shows him HE is guiltless. He can do NOTHING that\ncan hurt you, and by refusing to allow him to THINK HE CAN, you teach him\nthat the Atonement, which you have accepted for yourself, IS ALSO HIS. THERE IS\nNOTHING TO FORGIVE. No-one can hurt the Son of God. His guilt is WHOLLY without\ncause, and, being without cause, CANNOT exist.\n\nGod is the ONLY Cause, and guilt is NOT of Him. Teach no-one he has\nhurt you, for, if you do, you teach YOURSELF that what is NOT of God, HAS POWER\nOVER YOU. THE CAUSELESS CANNOT BE. Do not attest to it, and do not foster belief\nin it in any mind. Remember always MIND IS ONE, and CAUSE IS ONE. You will learn\ncommunication with this Oneness ONLY when you learn to DENY the causeless, and\naccept the Cause of God as YOURS. The power that God has given to His Son IS his,\nand nothing else can His Son see, or choose to look upon, without imposing on\nHIMSELF the penalty of guilt, IN PLACE of all the happy teaching the Holy Spirit\nwould gladly offer him.\n\nWhenever you decide to make decisions FOR YOURSELF, you are thinking\nself-destructively, and the decision WILL BE WRONG. It will hurt you, because of\nthe CONCEPT of decision which led to it. It is not true that you can make\ndecisions BY yourself, or FOR yourself alone. No thought of God's Son CAN be\nseparate, or isolated in its effects. Every decision is made for the WHOLE\nSONSHIP, directed in and out, and influencing a constellation larger than\nanything you ever dreamed of. Those who accept Atonement, ARE invulnerable. But\nthose who believe they are guilty, WILL respond to guilt, because THEY THINK IT\nIS SALVATION, and will NOT refuse to see it, and side WITH it. They BELIEVE that\nINCREASING guilt is self-PROTECTION. And they fail to understand the simple fact\nthat, what they do NOT want, MUST hurt them.\n\nAll this arises because they do NOT believe that WHAT THEY WANT IS\nGOOD. Yet will was given them BECAUSE it is holy, and will bring TO them ALL that\nthey need, coming as naturally as peace that knows no limits. There is NOTHING\ntheir wills will not provide, that offers them ANYTHING of value. But, because\nthey do NOT understand their will, the Holy Spirit quietly understands if FOR\nthem, and gives them what THEY will, without effort, strain, or the impossible\nburden of deciding WHAT THEY WANT AND NEED ALONE. It will never happen that you\nwill have to make decisions FOR YOURSELF. You are NOT bereft of help, and HELP\nTHAT KNOWS THE ANSWER. Would you be content with little, which is all that YOU\nALONE can offer yourself, when He Who GIVES YOU EVERYTHING will simply OFFER it TO you?\n\nHe will never ask what you have done to make you worthy of the gift of\nGod. Ask it not therefore of yourselves. Instead, accept His answer, for He KNOWS\nyou are worthy of everything God wills FOR you. Do not try to escape the gift of\nGod, which He so freely, and so gladly offers you. He offers you but what God\ngave Him FOR you. You need NOT decide whether or not you are DESERVING of it. GOD\nKNOWS THAT YOU ARE. Would you deny the truth of GOD'S decision, and place your\npitiful appraisal of yourself, in place of His calm and unswerving value of His\nSon? NOTHING can shake God's conviction of the perfect purity of everything that\nHe created, for it IS wholly pure. Do not decide AGAINST it, for being of Him it\nMUST be true.\n\nPeace abides in every mind that quietly accepts the plan that GOD has\nset for his Atonement, RELINQUISHING HIS OWN. You know NOT of Salvation, for you\ndo NOT understand it. Make no decisions about what it is, or where it lies, but\nask of the Holy Spirit EVERYTHING, and leave ALL decisions to His gentle counsel.\nThe One Who knows the plan, of God which God would have you follow, can teach you\nwhat it IS. Only His wisdom is capable of guiding you to follow it. Every\ndecision you undertake alone but signifies that you would define what Salvation\nis, and what you would be saved FROM. The Holy Spirit KNOWS that ALL Salvation is\nescape from guilt. You have no other “enemy,” and against this strange distortion\nof the purity of the Son of God, the Holy Spirit is your ONLY friend.\n\nHe is the strong protector of your innocence, which sets you free. And\nit is HIS decision to undo EVERYTHING that would obscure your innocence from your\nunclouded mind. Let Him, therefore, be the only guide that you would follow to\nSalvation. He knows the way, and leads you gladly on it. WITH Him, you will not\nfail to learn what God wills FOR you IS your will. WITHOUT His guidance, you will\nthink you know alone, and will decide AGAINST your peace, as surely as you made\nthe wrong decision in ever thinking that Salvation lay in you alone. Salvation is\nof Him to Whom God GAVE it FOR you. He has not forgotten it. Forget HIM not, and\nHe will make EVERY decision for you, for YOUR Salvation and the peace of God in\nyou.\n\nSeek not to appraise the worth of God's Son, whom He created holy, for\nto do so is TO EVALUATE HIS FATHER, and judge AGAINST Him. And you WILL feel\nguilty for this imagined “crime,” which no one in this world, or Heaven, CAN\nPOSSIBLY commit. God's Spirit teaches only that the “sin” of SELF replacement on\nthe throne of God is NOT a source of guilt. What CANNOT happen, can have no\neffects to fear. Be quiet in your faith in Him, Who loves you, and would lead you\nout of insanity. Madness may be your CHOICE, but NOT your reality. Never forget\nthe Love of God, Who HAS remembered you. For it is quite impossible that He could\never let His Son drop from His loving Mind, wherein he was created, and where his\nabode was fixed in perfect peace forever.\n\nSay to the Holy Spirit only, “Decide for me,” and it is done. For His\ndecisions are reflections of WHAT GOD KNOWS ABOUT YOU, and in this light, error\nof ANY kind becomes impossible. Why would you struggle so frantically to\nanticipate all that you CANNOT know,\nwhen ALL knowledge lies behind EVERY decision that the Holy Spirit makes FOR YOU?\nLearn of His wisdom and His love, and teach His answer to everyone who struggles\nin the dark. For you decide for THEM AND for yourself. How gracious is it to\ndecide all things through Him, Whose equal love is given equally to all alike. He\nleaves you no one OUTSIDE yourself, alone WITHOUT you. And so He gives you what\nis yours, because your Father would have you share it WITH him.\n\nIn everything be led by Him, and do not reconsider. Trust Him to\nanswer quickly, surely, and with love for everyone who will be touched, in any\nway by the decision. And EVERYONE will be. Would you take unto yourself the sole\nresponsibility for deciding what can bring ONLY good to everyone? Would you KNOW\nthis? You taught YOURSELVES the most unnatural habit of NOT communicating with\nyour Creator. Yet you remain in close communication with Him, and with everything\nthat is within Him, as it is within YOURSELF. UNlearn isolation through His\nloving guidance, and learn of all the happy communication that you have thrown\naway, but could NOT lose.\n\nWhenever you are in doubt what you should do, think of His Presence in\nyou, and tell yourself this, and ONLY this: “He leadeth me, and knows the way,\nwhich I know not. Yet He will never KEEP from me what He would have me LEARN. And\nso I trust Him to communicate to me all that He knows FOR me.” Then let Him teach\nyou quietly how to perceive your guiltlessness, which is ALREADY there.",

    "content": "The Way of Salvation\n\nWhen you accept a brother's guiltlessness, you will SEE Atonement in\nhim. For, by proclaiming it in HIM, you make it YOURS, and you WILL see what you\nsought. You will not see the symbol of your brother's guiltlessness shining\nwithin him, while you still believe IT IS NOT THERE. HIS guiltlessness is YOUR\nAtonement. Grant it to him, and you will see the truth of what you have\nacknowledged. Yet truth is offered FIRST, to be received, even as God gave it\nfirst to His Son. The first in time means nothing, but the First in Eternity is\nGod the Father, Who is both First and One. Beyond the First, there is no other,\nfor there is no order, no second or third, and nothing BUT the First.\n\nYou who belong to the First Cause, created by Him like unto Himself,\nand part of Him, are more than merely guiltless. The state of guiltlessness is\nonly the condition in which what is NOT there has been REMOVED, from the\ndisordered mind that THOUGHT it WAS. This state, and only this, must YOU attain\nwith God beside you. For until you do, you will still think that you are separate\nFROM Him. You can feel His Presence NEXT TO you, but CANNOT know that you are one\nwith Him. This need not be taught. Learning applies ONLY to the condition IN\nWHICH IT HAPPENS of itself.\n\nWhen you have let all that has obscured the truth in your most holy\nmind be undone for you, and stand in grace before your Father, He will give\nHimself to you, as He has ALWAYS done. Giving Himself is all He knows, and so it\nis ALL knowledge. For what He knows NOT cannot be, and therefore CANNOT BE GIVEN.\nAsk not to BE forgiven, for this has already been accomplished. Ask rather to\nLEARN how to forgive, and restore WHAT ALWAYS WAS to your unforgiving mind.\nAtonement becomes real and visible, to them that USE it. On earth, it is your\nONLY function, and you\nmust learn that it is all you WANT to learn.\n\nYou WILL feel guilty 'til you learn this. For, in the end, whatever\nform it takes, your guilt arises from your failure to fulfill your function in\nGod's Mind with ALL OF YOURS. Can you ESCAPE this guilt, by failing to fulfill\nyour function HERE? You need not understand creation, to do what must be done,\nBEFORE that knowledge would be meaningful to you. God breaks no barriers; neither\ndid He MAKE them. When YOU release them, they are gone. God will not fail, nor\never has, in anything.\n\nDecide that God is right, and YOU are wrong, about yourself. He\ncreated you out of Himself, but still WITHIN Him. He knows what you are. Remember\nthat there is no second to Him. There cannot, therefore, be anyone WITHOUT His\nHoliness, nor anyone unworthy of His perfect love. Fail not in your function of\nloving in a loveless place, made out of darkness and deceit, for thus are\ndarkness and deception UNdone. FAIL NOT YOURSELF, but instead, offer to God AND\nYOU His blameless Son. For this small gift of appreciation FOR His love, God will\nHimself exchange your gift for HIS.\n\nBefore you make ANY decisions for yourself, remember that YOU HAVE\nDECIDED AGAINST YOUR FUNCTION IN HEAVEN, and consider carefully whether you WANT\nto make decisions here. Your function here is only to decide AGAINST deciding\nwhat you want, in recognition that YOU DO NOT KNOW. How, then, CAN you decide\nwhat you should do? Leave ALL decisions to the One Who speaks for God, and for\nyour function as He KNOWS it. So will He teach you to remove the awful burden you\nhave laid upon yourself, by loving not the Son of God, and trying to teach him\nguilt INSTEAD of love. Give up this frantic and insane attempt,\nwhich cheats you of the joy of living with your God and Father, and awaking\ngladly to His Love and Holiness, which join together as truth in YOU, making you\nOne with Him.\n\nWhen you have learned how to decide WITH God, ALL decisions become as\neasy and as right as breathing. There is no effort, and you will be led as\ngently, as if you were being carried along a quiet path in summer. Only your own\nvolition seems to make deciding hard. The Holy Spirit will not delay at all in\nanswering your EVERY question what to do. He KNOWS. And He will TELL you, and",

But, if you do not accept the\nnecessary conditions for knowing Him, YOU HAVE DENIED HIM, and do not recognize\nHim, though He is all around you. He cannot be known without His Son, whose\nguiltlessness IS the condition for knowing Him. Accepting His Son as guilty is\ndenial of the Father so complete, that knowledge is swept away from recognition,\nin the very mind where God Himself has placed it. If you would but listen, and\nlearn how impossible this is! Do not endow Him with attributes YOU understand.\nYou made Him not, and anything YOU understand, is not of Him.\n\nYour task is not to make reality. It is here, WITHOUT your making, but\nNOT without YOU. You who have thrown your selves away, and valued God so little,\nhear me speak for Him, and for yourselves.

    "content": "Guilt and Guiltlessness\n\nThe guiltless and the guilty are totally incapable of understanding\none\nanother. Each perceives the other AS LIKE HIMSELF, making them unable to\ncommunicate, because each sees the other UNLIKE the way he sees himself. God can\ncommunicate ONLY to the Holy Spirit in your mind, because only He shares the\nknowledge of what you are WITH God. And only the Holy Spirit can answer God for\nYOU, for only He knows what God IS. Everything ELSE, that YOU have placed within\nyour mind, CANNOT exist, for what is not in communication with the Mind of God,\nhas never been. Communication with God is Life. Nothing without it IS at all.\n\nThe only part of your mind that has reality, is the part that links\nyou still with God. Would you have ALL of it transformed into a radiant message\nof God's Love, to share with all the lonely ones, who have denied Him with you?\nGOD MAKES THIS POSSIBLE. Would you deny His yearning to be known? You yearn for\nHim, as He for you. This is forever changeless. Accept, then, the immutable.\nLeave the world of death behind, and return quietly to Heaven. There is NOTHING\nof value here, and EVERYTHING of value there. Listen to the Holy Spirit, and to\nGod through Him. He speaks of you to YOU. There IS no guilt in you, for God is\nblessed in His Son, as the Son is blessed in Him.\n\nEach one of you has a special part to play in the Atonement, but the\nmessage given to each to share is always the same; GOD'S SON IS GUILTLESS. Each\none teaches the message differently, and learns it differently. But UNTIL he\nteaches it and learns it, he will suffer the pain of dim awareness, that his true\nfunction remains unfulfilled in him. The burden of guilt is heavy, but God would\nnot have you bound by it. HIS plan for your awaking is as perfect as yours is\nfallible. You know not what you do, but He Who knows is with you. His\ngentleness is yours, and all the love you share with God, He holds in trust for\nyou. He would teach you nothing except how to be happy.\n\nBlessed Son of a wholly blessing Father, joy was created FOR you. Who\ncan condemn whom God has blessed? There is nothing in the Mind of God that does\nnot share his shining innocence. Creation is the natural extension of perfect\npurity. Your only calling here is to devote yourself, with active willingness, to\nthe denial of guilt in ALL its forms. To accuse is NOT TO UNDERSTAND. The happy\nlearners of the Atonement become the teachers of the innocence that is the RIGHT\nof all that God created. Deny them not what is their due, for you will not\nwithhold it from them alone.\n\nThe inheritance of the Kingdom is the right of God's Son, given him in\nhis creation. Do not try to steal it from him, or you will ASK for guilt and WILL\nexperience it. PROTECT his purity from every thought that would steal it away,\nand keep it from his sight. BRING INNOCENCE TO LIGHT, in answer to the call of\nthe Atonement. Never allow purity to remain hidden, but shine away the heavy\nveils of guilt, within which the Son of God has hidden himself from his own\nsight. We are all joined in the Atonement here, and nothing else can unite us in\nthis world. So will the world of separation slip away, and full communication be\nrestored between the Father and the Son.\n\nThe miracle acknowledges the guiltlessness which MUST have been\ndenied, to produce NEED of healing. Do not withhold this glad acknowledgment, for\nhope of happiness, and release from suffering of every kind, lies in it. Who is\nthere but wishes to be free of pain? He may not yet have learned HOW to exchange\nhis guilt for innocence, nor realize that ONLY in this exchange can freedom from\npain be his. But those who have failed to learn need TEACHING, NOT attack. To\nattack those who have need of teaching is to fail to learn FROM them.\n\nTeachers of innocence, each in his own way, have joined together,\ntaking their part in the unified curriculum of the Atonement. There is no unity\nof learning goals apart from this. There is no conflict in this curriculum, which\nhas ONE aim, however it is taught. Each effort made on\nits behalf is offered to the single purpose of RELEASE from guilt, to the eternal\nglory of God and His creation. And every teaching that points to this points\nstraight to Heaven, and to the peace of God. There is no pain, no trial, no fear,\nthat teaching this can fail to overcome. The power of God Himself supports this\nteaching, and GUARANTEES its limitless results.\n\nJoin your own efforts to the Power that cannot fail, and MUST result\nin peace. No-one can be untouched by teaching such as this. You will not see\nyourself BEYOND the power of God if you teach only this. You will NOT be exempt\nfrom the effect of this most holy lesson, which seeks but to restore what is the\nright of God's creation. From everyone whom you accord release from guilt, you\nwill INEVITABLY learn YOUR innocence. The circle of Atonement HAS no end. And you\nwill find ever-increasing confidence in your safe inclusion in what is for all,\nin everyone you bring within its safety and its perfect peace.\n\nPeace, then, be unto everyone who becomes a teacher of peace. For\npeace is the acknowledgment of perfect purity, from which no-one is excluded.\nWithin its holy circle, is everyone whom God created as His Son. Joy is its\nunifying attribute, with no-one left outside, to suffer guilt alone. The power of\nGod draws everyone to its safe embrace of love and union. Stand quietly within\nthis circle, and attract all tortured minds to join with you, in the safety of\nits peace and holiness. Abide with me within it, as teachers of Atonement, NOT of\nguilt.\n\nBlessed are ye who teach with me. Our power comes not of us, but of\nour Father. In guiltlessness we know Him, as He knows us guiltless. I stand\nwithin the circle, calling YOU to peace. Teach peace with me, and stand with me\non holy ground. Remember for everyone your Father's power, that He has given\nthem. Believe not that you cannot teach His perfect peace. Stand not outside, but\njoin with me within. Fail not the only purpose to which MY teaching calls you.\nRestore to God His Son, as He created him, by teaching him his innocence.\n\nThe crucifixion had no part in the Atonement. Only the Resurrection\nbecame my part in it. THAT is the symbol of the RELEASE from guilt, by\nguiltlessness. Whomever you perceive as guilty, you would crucify. But you\nRESTORE guiltlessness to whomever you SEE as guiltless. Crucifixion is ALWAYS the\nego's aim. It SEES AS GUILTY, and BY its condemnation, IT WOULD KILL. The Holy\nSpirit sees only guiltlessness, and, in His gentleness, He would RELEASE from\nfear, and re-establish the reign of love. The power of love is in His gentleness,\nwhich is of God and therefore cannot crucify, nor suffer crucifixion. The temple\nyou restore becomes YOUR altar, for it was re-built through YOU. And everything\nyou give to God IS yours. Thus He creates, and thus must YOU restore.\n\nEach one you see you place, within the holy circle of Atonement, or\nleave outside, judging him fit for crucifixion or redemption. If you bring him\nINTO the circle of purity, you will rest there WITH him. If you leave him\nwithout, you JOIN him there. Judge not, except in quietness which is NOT of you.\nRefuse to accept anyone as WITHOUT the blessing of Atonement, and bring him INTO\nit by blessing him. Holiness MUST be shared, for therein lies everything that\nmakes it holy. Come gladly to the holy circle, and look out in peace on all who\nthink they are outside. Cast no-one out, for this is what HE seeks along with\nyou. Come, let us join him in the holy place of peace, which is for all of us,\nunited as one, within the cause of peace.",

    "content": "Out of the Darkness\n\nThe journey that we undertake together is the change of dark for\nlight, of ignorance for understanding. NOTHING YOU UNDERSTAND IS FEARFUL. It is\nonly in darkness and in ignorance that you perceive the frightening, and you\nshrink away from it to further darkness. And yet, it is only the hidden that CAN\nterrify, NOT for what it IS, but FOR its hiddenness. The obscure is frightening,\nBECAUSE you do not understand its meaning. If you did, IT would be clear, and you\nwould be no longer in the dark. Nothing has HIDDEN value, for what is hidden\nCANNOT be shared, and so its value is unknown. The hidden is KEPT APART, but\nvalue ALWAYS lies in joint appreciation. What is concealed CANNOT be loved, and\nso it MUST be feared.\n\nThe quiet light in which the Holy Spirit dwells within you, is merely\nperfect openness, in which nothing is hidden, and therefore nothing is feared.\nAttack will ALWAYS yield to love, if it is brought TO love, not hidden FROM it.\nThere is no darkness that the light of love will not dispel, unless it is\nconcealed from love's beneficence. What is KEPT APART from love CANNOT share its\nhealing power, because it has been separated off, and KEPT IN DARKNESS. The\nsentinels of darkness watch over it carefully, and you who made these guardians\nof illusion out of nothing, are now AFRAID of them.\n\nWould you continue to give imagined power to these strange ideas of\nsafety? They are neither safe nor unsafe. They do not protect, NEITHER DO THEY\nATTACK. They DO nothing at all, BEING nothing at all. As guardians of darkness\nand of ignorance, look to them ONLY for fear, for what they keep obscure IS\nfearful. But let them go, and what WAS fearful, will be so no longer. Without\nprotection of obscurity, ONLY the light of love remains, for only this HAS\nmeaning, and CAN live in light. Everything else MUST disappear.\n\nDeath yields to life, simply because destruction IS NOT TRUE. The\nlight of guiltlessness shines guilt away because, when they are BROUGHT TOGETHER,\nthe truth\nof one MUST make the falsity of its OPPOSITE perfectly clear. Keep not guilt and\nguiltlessness APART, for your belief that you can HAVE THEM BOTH, is meaningless.\nAll you have done by keeping them apart is LOSE THEIR MEANING, by confusing them\nwith each other. And so you do not realize that only one means ANYTHING, and the\nother is wholly without sense of ANY kind.\n\nYou have interpreted the separation as a means which you have made for\nBREAKING your communication with your Father. The Holy Spirit re-interprets it as\na means of re-establishing what has NOT been broken, but HAS been made obscure.\nAll things you made have use to Him, for His most holy purpose. He KNOWS you are\nnot separate from God, but He perceives much in your mind that lets you THINK you\nare. All this, and nothing else, would He separate FROM you. The power of\ndecision, which you made IN PLACE of power of creation, He would teach you how to\nuse ON YOUR BEHALF. You who made it to crucify yourselves, must learn of Him how\nto apply it to the holy cause of restoration.\n\nYou who speak in dark and devious symbols, do not understand the\nlanguage you have made. It HAS no meaning, for its purpose is NOT communication,\nbut rather, the DISRUPTION of communication. If the purpose of language IS\ncommunication, how can this tongue mean ANYTHING? Yet even this strange and\ntwisted effort to communicate through NOT communicating, holds enough of love to\nMAKE IT MEANINGFUL, IF ITS INTERPRETER IS NOT ITS MAKER. You who made it are but\nexpressing CONFLICT, from which the Holy Spirit would RELEASE you. Leave what you\nwould communicate to Him. He will interpret it to you with perfect clarity, for\nHe knows with Whom you ARE in perfect communication.\n\nYou know not what you say, and so you know not what is said to you.\nBut your Interpreter perceives the meaning in your alien language. He will not\nattempt to communicate the meaningless. But He WILL separate out all that HAS\nmeaning, dropping off all the rest, and offering your true communication to those\nwho would communicate as truly WITH you. YOU SPEAK TWO LANGUAGES AT ONCE, and\nthis MUST lead to unintelligibility. But if one means nothing, and the other\nEVERYTHING, only that one is possible for purposes of communication. The other\nbut INTERFERES with it.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's function is ENTIRELY communication. He therefore\nMUST remove whatever INTERFERES with it, in order to RESTORE it. Therefore, keep\nno source of interference from His sight, for He will NOT attack your sentinels.\nBut bring them TO Him, and let His gentleness teach you that, in the light, they\nare not fearful, and CANNOT serve to guard the dark doors behind which nothing at\nall is carefully concealed. We must open all doors, and let the light come",

    "content": "Perception without Deceit\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT? Light or darkness, knowledge or ignorance are yours,\nbut not both. Opposites must be brought together, and not kept apart. For their\nseparation is only in your mind, and they are reconciled by union, as YOU are. In\nunion, everything that is not real MUST disappear, for truth IS union. As\ndarkness disappears in light, so ignorance fades away when knowledge dawns.\nPerception is the medium by which ignorance is BROUGHT to knowledge. But the\nperception must be without deceit, for otherwise, it becomes the messenger of\nignorance, rather than a helper in the search for truth.\n\nThe search for truth is but the honest searching out of everything\nthat INTERFERES with truth. TRUTH IS. And can be neither lost, nor sought, nor\nfound. It is there, wherever YOU are, being WITHIN you. But it CAN be recognized\nor unrecognized, real or false, to YOU. If you hide it, it becomes unreal to you,\nBECAUSE you hid it, and SURROUNDED IT WITH FEAR. Under each cornerstone of fear,\non which you have erected your insane system of belief, THE TRUTH LIES HIDDEN.\nYet you cannot know this, for, by HIDING truth in fear, you see no reason to\nbelieve the more you LOOK at fear, the LESS you see it, and the clearer WHAT IT\nCONCEALS becomes.\n\nIt is not possible to convince the unknowing that they know. From\ntheir point of view, IT IS NOT TRUE. Yet it IS true, because GOD knows it. These\nare clearly opposite viewpoints of what the “unknowing” ARE. To God, unknowing is\nimpossible. It is therefore not a point of view at all, but merely a belief in\nsomething that does not exist. It is only this BELIEF that the unknowing have,\nand BY it, they are wrong about themselves. They have DEFINED themselves as they\nwere NOT created. Their creation was NOT a point of view, but rather, a\nCERTAINTY. Uncertainty BROUGHT to certainty does not retain ANY conviction of\nreality.\n\nYou must have noticed that the emphasis has been on bringing what is\nundesirable TO the desirable, what you do NOT want to what you DO. You will\nrealize\nthat salvation MUST come to you this way, if you consider what dissociation IS.\nDissociation is a distorted process of thinking, whereby two systems of belief,\nwhich CANNOT coexist, are BOTH MAINTAINED. It HAS BEEN recognized that, if they\nwere BROUGHT TOGETHER, their joint acceptance WOULD become impossible. But, if\none is kept in darkness FROM THE OTHER, their SEPARATION seems to keep them both\nalive, and equal in their reality. Their JOINING thus becomes the source of fear,\nfor, if they meet, acceptance MUST be withdrawn from one of them.\n\nYou CANNOT have them both, for each DENIES the other. Apart, this fact\nis lost from sight, for each, in a SEPARATE place, CAN be endowed with firm\nbelief. BRING THEM TOGETHER, and the fact of their complete incompatibility is\ninstantly apparent. One WILL go, BECAUSE the other is seen in the SAME place.\nLight cannot enter darkness, when a mind BELIEVES in darkness, and will not let\nit go. Truth does not struggle AGAINST ignorance, and love does not ATTACK fear.\nWhat needs no protection, does not defend itself. Defense was of YOUR making. God\nknows it not.\n\nThe Holy Spirit uses defenses ON BEHALF of truth, only because you\nmade them AGAINST it. His perception of them, according to HIS purpose, merely\nchanges them into a CALL FOR what you have ATTACKED WITH them. Defenses, like\neverything you made, must be gently turned to your own good, translated by Him\nfrom means of self-destruction, to means of preservation and release. His task is\nmighty, but the power of God is with Him. Therefore, to Him, it is so easy, that\nit was accomplished the instant it was given Him for you.\n\nDo not delay yourselves in your return to peace, by wondering how He\ncan fulfill what God has given Him to do. Leave that to Him Who knows! You are\nnot asked to do mighty tasks yourself. You are merely asked to do the little He\nSUGGESTS you do, trusting Him only to the small extent of believing that, if He\nasks it, you can do it. You will SEE how easily ALL that He asks can be\naccomplished. He asks of you but this; - bring to Him every secret you have\nlocked away from Him. Open every door to Him, and bid Him enter the darkness, and\nlighten it away.\n\nAt YOUR request, He enters gladly. He brings the light to darkness, if\nyou make the darkness OPEN to Him. But what you hide, He cannot look upon. For He\nsees FOR YOU, and unless you look WITH Him, He CANNOT see. The vision of Christ\nis not for Him alone, but for Him WITH YOU. Bring, therefore, all your dark and\nsecret thoughts to Him, and look upon them WITH Him. He holds the light, and you\nthe darkness. They CANNOT coexist, when both of you TOGETHER look on them. His\njudgment MUST prevail, and He will GIVE it to you, as you join your perception to\nHis. Joining with Him in seeing, is the way in which you learn to share with Him\nthe interpretation of perception that leads to knowledge.\n\nYou cannot see alone. Sharing perception with Him Whom God has given\nyou, teaches you how to RECOGNIZE what you see. It is the recognition that\nNOTHING you see means ANYTHING alone. Seeing WITH Him will SHOW you that all\nmeaning, INCLUDING YOURS, comes not from double vision, but from the gentle\nfusing of everything into one meaning, one emotion and one purpose. God has one\nPurpose, which He shares with you. The single vision, which the Holy Spirit\noffers you, will bring this Oneness to your mind with clarity and brightness so\nintense, you could not wish, for all the world, not to accept what God would have\nyou have. Behold your will, accepting it as His, with all His love as yours. All\nhonor to you through Him, and through Him unto God.\n\nIn the darkness you have obscured the glory God gave you, and the\npower that He bestowed upon His guiltless Son. All that, lies hidden in every\ndarkened place shrouded in guilt, and in the dark denial of innocence. Behind the\ndark\ndoors which you have closed lies nothing, BECAUSE nothing CAN obscure the gift of\nGod. It is the CLOSING of the doors, that interferes with recognition of the\npower of God that shines in you. Banish not power from your mind, but let all\nthat would hide your glory, be brought to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, and\nthere undone. Whom He would save for glory IS saved for it. He has promised the\nFather that, through Him, you would be released from littleness to glory.\n\nTo what He promised God, He is wholly faithful, for He shared WITH God\nthe promise that was given to Him to share with YOU. He shares it still, FOR YOU.\nEverything that promises otherwise, great or small, however much or little\nvalued, He will replace with the one promise GIVEN unto Him to lay upon the altar\nto your Father and His Son. No altar stands to God WITHOUT His Son. And NOTHING\nbrought there that is not equally worthy of BOTH, but will be REPLACED by gifts\nwholly acceptable to Father AND to Son. Can you offer guilt to God? You cannot,\nthen, offer it to His Son. For they are NOT apart, and gifts to one ARE offered\nto the other.\n\nYou know not God, because you know not this. And yet you DO know God,\nand ALSO this. All this is safe WITHIN you, where the Holy Spirit shines. He\nshines not in division, but in the meeting-place where God, UNITED with His Son,\nspeaks to His Son THROUGH Him. Communication between what cannot BE divided\nCANNOT cease. The holy meeting-place of the unseparated Father and His Son lies\nin the Holy Spirit, and in YOU. All interference in the communication that God\nHimself wills with His Son is quite impossible here. Unbroken and uninterrupted\nlove flows constantly between the Father and the Son, as BOTH would have it be.\nAnd so it IS.\n\nLet your minds wander not through darkened corridors, AWAY from\nLight's center. You may choose to lead YOURSELVES astray, but you can only be\nBROUGHT TOGETHER by the Guide appointed FOR you. He will surely lead you to where\nGod\nand His Son await your recognition. They are joined in giving you the gift of\nOneness, before which ALL separation vanishes. Unite with what you ARE. You\nCANNOT join with anything EXCEPT reality. God's glory and His Son's BELONG to you\nin truth. They HAVE no opposite, and nothing else CAN you bestow upon yourselves.\n\nThere is no substitute for truth. And truth will make this plain to\nyou, as you are brought into the place where you must MEET with truth. And there\nyou must be led, through gentle understanding, which can lead you nowhere else.\nWhere God is, there are YOU. Such IS the truth. Nothing can change the knowledge\nGIVEN you by God into UNknowing. Everything God created KNOWS its Creator. For\nthis is how creation is accomplished, by the Creator, and by His creations. In\nthe holy meeting-place are joined the Father and His creations, and the creations\nof His Son, with them together.\n\nThere is one link which joins them all together, holding them in the\nOneness out of which creation happens. The link with which the Father joins\nHimself to those He gives the power to create LIKE Him, can NEVER be dissolved.\nHeaven itself is union with ALL of creation, and with its One Creator. And Heaven\nremains the Will of God for YOU. Lay no gifts other than this upon your altars,\nfor nothing can coexist BESIDE it. Here, your meager offerings are BROUGHT",

    "content": "The Recognition of Holiness\n\nThe Atonement does not MAKE holy. You were CREATED holy. It merely\nbrings UNholiness TO holiness, or what you MADE, to what you ARE. The bringing\ntogether of truth and illusion, OF THE EGO AND GOD, is the Holy Spirit's only\nfunction. Keep not your making from your Father, for hiding it has cost you\nknowledge of Him, and of yourselves. The knowledge is safe, but wherein is YOUR\nsafety, APART from it? The making of time, to TAKE THE PLACE of timelessness, lay\nin the decision to BE NOT as you WERE. Thus, truth was made past, and the present\nwas dedicated to illusion. And the past, too, was changed, and INTERPOSED between\nwhat ALWAYS was, and NOW. The past that YOU remember NEVER was, and represents\nonly denial of what ALWAYS was.\n\nBringing the ego to God, is but to bring error to truth, where it\nstands corrected, because it is the OPPOSITE of what it meets, and is undone\nbecause the CONTRADICTION can no longer stand. How long can contradiction stand,\nwhen its impossible nature is clearly revealed? What disappears in light is NOT\nattacked. It merely vanishes, because it is not true. Different realities ARE\nmeaningless, for reality MUST be one. It CANNOT change with time, or mood, or\nchance. Its changelessness is WHAT MAKES IT REAL. This CANNOT be undone. Undoing\nis for UNreality. And this, reality WILL do for you.\n\nMerely by BEING WHAT IT IS, does truth release you from everything\nthat it is NOT. The Atonement is so gentle, you need but whisper to it, and all\nits power will rush to your assistance and support. You are not frail, with God\nbeside you. But WITHOUT Him, you are nothing. The Atonement OFFERS YOU GOD. The\ngift which you refused, is held by Him in you. His Spirit holds it there FOR you.\nGod has not left His altar, though His worshippers placed other gods upon it. The\ntemple still is holy, for the Presence that dwells within it IS Holiness.\n\nIn the temple, holiness waits quietly for the return of them that love\nit. For the Presence knows they will return to purity and to grace. The\ngraciousness of God will take them gently in, and cover all their sense of pain\nand loss, with the immortal assurance of their Father's Love. There, fear of\ndeath will be\nreplaced with joy of living. For God is Life, and they abide IN Life. Life is as\nholy as the Holiness by which it was created. The Presence of Holiness lives in\neverything that lives, for Holiness CREATED life, and leaves not what it created\nholy as Itself.\n\nIn the world you, can become a spotless mirror, in which the holiness\nof your Creator shines forth from you, to all around you. You can REFLECT HEAVEN\nhere. But no reflections of the images of other gods must dim the mirror that\nwould hold God's reflection in it. Earth can reflect Heaven or hell; God or the\nego. You need but leave the mirror clean, and clear of all the images of hidden\ndarkness you have drawn upon it. God will shine upon it of Himself. Only the\nclear reflection OF Himself can BE perceived upon it. Reflections are seen in\nlight. In darkness, they are obscure, and their meaning seems to lie only in\nshifting interpretations, rather than in themselves.\n\nThe reflection of God NEEDS no interpretation. IT IS CLEAR. Clear but\nthe mirror, and the message which shines forth from what the mirror holds out for\neveryone to see, NO-ONE will fail to understand. It is the message that the Holy\nSpirit is holding to the mirror that is in HIM. He recognizes it, because he has\nbeen taught his NEED for it, but knows not where to look to FIND it. Let him,\nthen, see it in YOU, and share it WITH you. Could you but realize, for a single\ninstant, the power of healing that the reflection of God, shining in YOU, can\nbring to all the world, you COULD not wait to make the mirror of your mind clean,\nto receive the image of the Holiness that heals the world.\n\nThe image of holiness that shines in YOUR mind is NOT obscure, and\nwill NOT change. Its meaning, to those who look upon it is not obscure, for\neveryone perceives it AS THE SAME. All bring their DIFFERENT problems to its\nhealing light, but ALL their problems are met ONLY with healing there. The\nresponse of holiness, to ANY form of error, is ALWAYS the same. There is no\ncontradiction in what holiness CALLS FORTH. Its ONE response is healing, without\nANY regard for what is brought TO it.\n\nThose who have learned to offer ONLY healing, because of the\nreflection of holiness in them, are ready at last for Heaven.

The\nreflections that you accept into the mirror of your minds in time, but bring\neternity nearer or farther.\n\nBut eternity ITSELF is beyond ALL time. Reach out of time and touch\nit, with the help of its reflection IN you, and you will turn FROM time to\nholiness, as surely as the reflection of holiness calls everyone to lay all guilt\naside. Reflect the peace of Heaven HERE, and bring this world to Heaven. For the\nREFLECTION of truth draws everyone TO truth. And as they enter INTO it, they\nleave ALL reflections behind. In Heaven, reality is SHARED, and not reflected. By\nsharing its reflection HERE, its truth becomes the only perception which the Son\nof God accepts. And thus, remembrance of His Father dawns on him, and he can no\nlonger be satisfied with anything but his own reality.\n\nYou on earth have no conception of limitlessness, for the world you\nseem to live in IS a world of limits. In this world, it is NOT true that anything\nwithout order of difficulty can occur. The miracle, therefore, has a unique\nfunction, and is motivated by a unique Teacher, Who brings the laws of another\nworld to this one. The miracle is the one thing you can do that TRANSCENDS order,\nbeing based, NOT on differences, but on equality. Miracles are NOT in\ncompetition, and the number you can do is LIMITLESS. They can be simultaneous and\nlegion. This is not difficult to understand, once you conceive of them as\npossible at all.\n\nWhat is more difficult to grasp is the lack of order of magnitude,\nwhich stamps the miracle as something that MUST come from elsewhere, NOT from\nhere. From the world's viewpoint, this is quite impossible. You have experienced\nthe lack of competition among your thoughts, which, even though they may\nconflict, can occur to you together, and in great numbers. You are so used to\nthis, that it can cause you little surprise. Yet you are also used to classifying\nsome of your thoughts as more important, larger, or better, wiser, or more\nproductive and valuable, than others. And this is true about the thoughts that\ncross the mind of those who think they live apart. For some are reflections of\nHeaven, while others are motivated by the ego, which but SEEMS to think.\n\nThe result is a weaving, changing pattern that never rests, and is\nnever still. It shifts unceasingly across the mirror of your mind, and the\nreflections of Heaven last but a moment, and grow dim, as darkness blots them\nout. Where there was light, darkness removes it in an instant, and alternating\npatterns of light and darkness, darkness and light, sweep constantly across your\nminds. The little sanity that still remains is held together by a sense of order\nwhich YOU establish. The very fact that you can DO this, and bring ANY order into\nchaos, shows you that you are NOT an ego, and that MORE than an ego MUST be in\nyou. For the ego IS chaos, and if it were all of you, no order at all would be\npossible.\n\nBut, though the order which you impose upon your minds limits the ego,\nIT ALSO LIMITS YOU. To order is to judge, and to arrange BY judgment. Therefore,\nit is NOT your function, but the Holy Spirit's. It will seem very difficult for\nyou to learn that YOU HAVE NO BASIS AT ALL for ordering your thoughts. This\nlesson the Holy Spirit teaches, by giving you shining examples, to show you that\nyour way of ordering is wrong, but that a better way is OFFERED you. The miracle\noffers EXACTLY the same response to EVERY call for help. IT DOES NOT JUDGE THE\nCALL. It merely recognizes what it IS, and answers accordingly. It does NOT\nconsider which call is louder, or greater, or more important.\n\nYou may wonder how you, who are still bound to judgment, can be asked\nto do that which requires no judgment of your own. The answer is very simple. The\npower of God, and NOT of you, engenders miracles. The miracle ITSELF is but\nthe witness that you HAVE the power of God in you. That is the reason that the\nmiracle gives EQUAL blessing to ALL who share in it, and that is also why\nEVERYONE shares in it. The power of God IS limitless. And, being always maximal,\nit offers EVERYTHING to EVERY call from ANYONE. There is no order here. A call\nfor help is GIVEN help. The only judgment involved at all is in the Holy Spirit's\none division into two categories; one of love, and the other, the call for love.\n\nYou cannot safely make this division, for you are much too confused,\neither to recognize love, or to believe that EVERYTHING else is nothing but a\nNEED for love. You are too bound to form, and NOT to content. What you CONSIDER\ncontent, is not content at all. It is merely form, and nothing else. For you do\nNOT respond to what a brother REALLY offers you, but only to the particular\nperception of his offering by which your EGO judges it. The ego is incapable of\nunderstanding content, and is totally unconcerned with it. To the ego, if the\nform is acceptable, the content MUST be. Otherwise, it will attack the form.\n\nYou who believe you understand something of the dynamics of the mind,\nlet me assure you that you know NOTHING of it at all. For of yourselves, you\nCOULD not know of it. The study of the ego is NOT the study of the mind. In fact,\nthe ego enjoys the study of itself, and thoroughly approves the undertakings of\nthe students who would analyze it, approving its importance. Yet they but study\nform, with meaningless content. For their teacher is senseless, though careful to\nconceal this fact behind a lot of words that sound impressive, but which lack ANY\nconsistent sense when they are put together.\n\nThis is the characteristic of the ego's judgments. SEPARATELY, they\nseem to hold, but PUT THEM TOGETHER, and the system of thought which arises from\nJOINING them, is incoherent and utterly chaotic. For form is not enough for\nmeaning, and the underlying LACK of content, makes a cohesive system impossible.\nSEPARATION therefore remains the ego's chosen condition. For no-one ALONE can\njudge the ego truly. But when two or more JOIN TOGETHER in searching for truth,\nthe ego can no longer defend its lack of content. The fact of union tells them it\nis not true.\n\nIt is impossible to remember God in secret and alone. For remembering\nHim means you are NOT alone, and willing to remember it. Take no thought FOR\nYOURSELF, for no thought you hold IS for yourself. If you would remember your\nFather, let the Holy Spirit order your thoughts, and give only the answer with\nwhich He answers you. Everyone seeks for love, as you do, and knows it not,\nunless he joins WITH you in seeking it. If you undertake the search TOGETHER, you\nbring with you a light so powerful, that what you see is GIVEN meaning. The\nlonely journey fails, because it has EXCLUDED what it would FIND.\n\nAs God communicates to the Holy Spirit in you, so does the Holy Spirit\nTRANSLATE His communications THROUGH you, so YOU can understand them. God has no\nsecret communications, for everything of Him is perfectly open, and freely\naccessible to all, being FOR all. Nothing lives in secret, and what you would\nhide from the Holy Spirit IS nothing. Every interpretation you would lay upon a\nbrother is senseless. Let the Holy Spirit SHOW HIM TO YOU, and teach you both his\nlove and NEED for love. Neither his mind, NOR YOURS, holds but these two orders\nof thought. The miracle is the recognition that this is true.\n\nWhere there is love, your brother MUST give it to you, because of what\nit IS. But where there is NEED for love, YOU must give it, because of what YOU\nare. Long ago we said this course will teach you what you are, restoring to you\nyour identity. And we have already learned that this identity is shared. THE\nMIRACLE BECOMES THE MEANS OF SHARING IT. By SUPPLYING your identity, WHEREVER it\nis NOT recognized, YOU will recognize it. And God Himself, Who wills to be with",

    "content": "The Test of Truth\n\nBut the essential thing is learning that YOU DO NOT KNOW. Knowledge is\npower, and all power is of God. You who have tried to keep power for yourselves,\nhave lost it. You still HAVE the power, but you have interposed so much between\nit and your AWARENESS of it, that you cannot use it. EVERYTHING you have taught\nyourselves has made your power more and more obscure to you. You know not WHAT it\nis, nor WHERE. You have made a SEMBLANCE of power, and a SHOW of strength, so\npitiful that it MUST fail you. For power is not seeming strength, and truth is\nbeyond a semblance of any kind.\n\nYet all that stands between you, and the power of God in you, is but\nyour learning of the false, and your attempts to UNDO THE TRUE. Be willing, then,\nfor ALL of it to be undone, and be glad that you are not bound to it forever. For\nyou have taught yourselves HOW TO IMPRISON THE SON OF GOD, a lesson so\nunthinkable that only the insane, in deepest sleep, could even DREAM of it. Can\nGod learn how NOT to be God? And can His Son, GIVEN all power BY Him, learn to be\npowerLESS? What have you taught yourselves that you can possibly prefer to keep,\nin place of what you HAVE, and what you ARE?\n\nAtonement teaches you how to escape forever from everything that you\nhave taught yourselves in the past, by showing you ONLY what you ARE NOW.\nLearning HAS BEEN accomplished, BEFORE its effects are manifest. Learning is\ntherefore IN THE PAST, but its influence DETERMINES the present, by giving it\nwhatever meaning it holds for you. Your learning gives the present NO MEANING AT\nALL. Nothing you have ever learned can help you understand the present, or teach\nyou how to undo the past. Your past IS what you have taught yourselves.\n\nLET IT ALL GO. Do NOT attempt to understand ANY event, or ANYTHING, or\nANYONE in its light, for the light of darkness, by which you TRY to see, can ONLY\nobscure. Put no confidence at all in darkness to illuminate your\nunderstanding, for if you do, you CONTRADICT the light, and thereby THINK you see\nthe darkness. Yet darkness cannot BE seen, for it is nothing more than a\ncondition in which seeing becomes impossible. You who have not yet brought ALL of\nthe darkness you have taught yourselves unto the light in you, can hardly judge\nthe truth and value of this course. Yet God did not abandon you. And so you have\nanother lesson, sent from Him, ALREADY learned for every Child of Light, by Him\nto Whom God gave it.\n\nThis lesson shines with God's glory, for in it lies His power, which\nHe shares so gladly with His Son. Learn of His happiness, which is yours. But to\naccomplish this, all your dark lessons MUST be brought willingly to truth, and\njoyously laid down, by hands open to receive, not closed to take. Every dark\nlesson that you bring to Him Who teaches light, He will accept FROM you, BECAUSE\nYOU DO NOT WANT IT. And He will gladly EXCHANGE each one for the bright lesson He\nhas learned FOR you. Never believe that ANY lesson you have learned, APART from\nHim, means ANYTHING.\n\nYou have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognize if what you\nlearned is true. If you are WHOLLY free of fear of any kind, and if all those who\nmeet, or even THINK of you, SHARE in your perfect peace, then you can be sure\nthat you have learned GOD'S lesson, and NOT yours. Unless all this is true, there\nARE dark lessons in your minds, which hurt and hinder you, AND EVERYONE AROUND\nYOU. The ABSENCE of PERFECT peace means but ONE thing; you THINK you do not will\nfor God's Son what His Father wills for him. Every dark lesson teaches this, on\none form or another. And each bright lesson, with which the Holy Spirit will\nREPLACE the dark ones you do NOT accept and hide, teaches you that you will WITH\nthe Father unto His Son.\n\nDo not be concerned how you can learn a lesson so COMPLETELY different\nfrom everything you have taught yourselves. How would you know? Your part is very\nsimple. You need only recognize that everything YOU learned you DO NOT WANT. Ask\nto BE taught, and do NOT use your experiences to confirm what YOU have learned.\nWhen your peace is threatened, or disturbed in\nANY way, say to yourself, “I do not know what anything, INCLUDING THIS, means.\nAnd so I do NOT know HOW TO RESPOND TO IT. And I will not use my own past\nlearning as the light to guide me now.” By this refusal to attempt to teach\nyourself what you do not know, the Guide Whom God has given you, will speak to\nyou. HE will take His rightful place in your awareness, the instant YOU abandon\nit, and offer it to Him.\n\nYOU cannot be your guide to miracles, for it is you who made them\nnecessary. And, because you did, the means on which you can DEPEND for miracles,\nhas been provided FOR you. God's Son can make no needs His Father will not meet,\nif he but turn to Him ever so little. Yet He cannot COMPEL His Son to turn to\nHim, and remain Himself. It is impossible that God lose His identity, for if He\ndid, YOU WOULD LOSE YOURS. And BEING yours, He cannot change Himself, for your\nidentity IS changeless. The miracle ACKNOWLEDGES His changelessness, by seeing\nHis Son as he always was, and NOT as he would make himself. The miracle brings\nthe effect which ONLY guiltlessness CAN bring, and thus establishes the fact that\nguiltlessness MUST BE.\n\nHow can you, so firmly bound to guilt and committed so to remain,\nestablish FOR YOURSELF your guiltlessness? This is impossible. But be sure that\nyou are willing to acknowledge that it IS impossible. It is only because you\nthink that you can run some little part, or deal with certain aspects of your\nlives alone, that the guidance of the Holy Spirit is limited. Thus would you make\nHIM undependable, and USE this fancied undependability as an excuse for keeping\ncertain dark lessons FROM Him. And, by so limiting the guidance that you would\nACCEPT, YOU are unable to DEPEND on miracles, to answer ALL your problems FOR\nyou.\n\nDo you think that what the Holy Spirit would have you GIVE, He would\nwithhold from YOU? You have NO problems which He cannot solve, by offering YOU a\nmiracle. Miracles are for YOU. And EVERY fear or pain or trial you have HAS BEEN\nundone. HE has brought ALL of them to light, having\nACCEPTED them INSTEAD of you, and recognized that they never were. There ARE no\ndark lessons He has not ALREADY lightened FOR you. The lessons you would teach\nyourselves, He has corrected already. They do not exist in His Mind at all. For\nthe past binds HIM not, and therefore binds not you.\n\nHe does not see time as you do. And each miracle He offers you,\nCORRECTS your use of time, and makes it His. He Who has freed you from the past,\nwould teach you, you ARE free of it. He would but have you accept His\naccomplishments AS YOURS, because He did them FOR you. And because He did, they\nARE yours. He has MADE you free of what you made. You can deny Him, but you\nCANNOT call upon Him in vain. He ALWAYS gives what HE has made, IN PLACE of you.\nHe would establish His bright teaching so firmly in your mind, that no dark\nlessons of guilt can abide in what He has established as holy by His Presence.\n\nThank God that He is there, and works through you. And all His works\nare yours. He offers YOU a miracle, with every one you LET Him do through you.\nGod's Son will ALWAYS be indivisible. As we are held as one in God, so do we\nlearn as one in Him. God's Teacher is as like to His Creator as is His Son, and\nthrough His Teacher does God proclaim His Oneness AND His Son's. Listen in\nsilence, and do NOT raise your voice against Him. For He teaches the miracle of\nOneness, and before HIS lesson, division disappears. Teach LIKE Him here, and you\nWILL remember that you have ALWAYS created like your Father. The miracle of\ncreation has never ceased, having the holy stamp of immortality upon it. This is\nthe Will of God for all creation, and all creation joins in willing this.\n\nThose who remember always that THEY know nothing, but who have become\nwilling to learn EVERYTHING, will learn it. But whenever they trust THEMSELVES,\nthey will NOT learn. They have destroyed their motivation for learning, BY\nTHINKING THEY ALREADY KNOW. Think not you understand ANYTHING, until you pass the\ntest of perfect peace, for peace and understanding GO TOGETHER, and never can be\nfound alone. Each brings the other WITH it, for\nit is the law of God that they be not separate. They are cause and effect, each\nto the other, so, where one is absent, the other CANNOT be.\n\nOnly those who see they CANNOT know, UNLESS the effects of\nunderstanding are with them, can really learn at all. And for this, IT MUST BE\nPEACE THEY WANT, and nothing else. Whenever you think YOU know, peace will depart\nfrom you, because you have abandoned the Teacher of Peace. Whenever you fully\nrealize that YOU KNOW NOT, peace will return, for you will have invited Him to do\nso, by abandoning the ego on behalf of Him. Call not upon the ego for ANYTHING.\nIt is only that, that you need do. The Holy Spirit will, OF HIMSELF, fill every\nmind that so makes room for Him. If you want peace, you MUST abandon the teacher\nof attack.\n\nThe Teacher of Peace can NEVER abandon YOU. YOU can desert HIM, but He\nwill never reciprocate. For His faith in you IS His understanding. It is as firm\nas is His faith in His Creator, and He knows that faith in His Creator MUST\nencompass faith in creation. In this consistency, lies His holiness, which He\nCANNOT abandon, for it is not His Will to do so. With your perfection ever in His\nsight, He gives the gift of peace to everyone who perceives the NEED for peace,\nand who would have it. Make way for peace, and it will come. For understanding IS\nin you, and from it, peace MUST come.\n\nThe power of God, from which they both arise, is yours as surely as it\nis His. You think you know Him not, only because, alone, it is impossible to know\nHim. But see the mighty works that He will do through you, and you MUST be\nconvinced you did them through Him. It is impossible to deny the Source of",

    "content": "The Uses of Time\n\nThe ego IS an ally of time, but NOT a friend. For it is as mistrustful\nof death as it is of life, and what it wants for you, IT cannot tolerate. The ego\nwants YOU dead, but NOT itself. The outcome of its strange religion MUST\ntherefore be the conviction that it can pursue you BEYOND the grave. And out of\nits unwillingness for you to find peace, even in the death it wants for you, it\noffers you immortality in hell. It speaks to you of Heaven, but assures you that\nHeaven is not for you. How can the guilty hope for Heaven?\n\nThe belief in hell is inescapable to those who identify with the ego.\nTheir nightmares and their fears are all associated with it. The ego teaches that\nhell is IN THE FUTURE, for this is what ALL its teaching is directed to.\nHELL IS ITS GOAL. For, although the ego aims at death and dissolution as an end,\nIT does not believe it. The goal of death, which it craves for you, leaves IT\nunsatisfied. No-one who follows the ego's teaching is without the FEAR of death.\nIf death were thought of merely as an end of pain, would it be FEARED?\n\nWe have seen this strange paradox in the ego's thought-system before,\nbut never so clearly as here. For the ego must SEEM to KEEP FEAR FROM YOU, to\nkeep your allegiance. Yet it must ENGENDER fear, in order to maintain ITSELF.\nAgain, the ego tries, and all too frequently succeeds, in doing both, but using\ndissociation for holding its contradictory aims together, so that they SEEM to be\nreconciled. The ego teaches thus: Death is the end, as far as hope of Heaven\ngoes. But, because you and ITSELF cannot be separated, and because it cannot\nconceive of its OWN death, it will pursue you still, BECAUSE YOUR GUILT IS\nETERNAL.\n\nSuch is the ego's version of immortality. And it is THIS the ego's\nversion of time supports. The ego teaches that Heaven is here and now, because\nthe FUTURE is hell. Even when it attacks so savagely that it tries to take the\nlife of someone who hears it temporarily as the ONLY voice, it speaks of hell\neven to him. For it tells him hell is HERE, and bids him leap from hell into\noblivion. The only time the ego allows anyone to look upon, with some amount of\nequanimity is the PAST. And even then, its only value is that it is no more.\n\nHow bleak and despairing is the ego's use of time! And how TERRIFYING!\nFor underneath its fanatical insistence that the past and future be the same, is\nhidden a far more insidious threat to peace. The ego does not advertise its final\nthreat, for it would have its worshippers still believe that IT can offer the\nESCAPE from it. But the belief in guilt MUST lead to the BELIEF IN HELL, and\nALWAYS DOES. The only way in which the ego allows the fear of hell to be\nexperienced is to BRING HELL HERE, but ALWAYS as a foretaste of the future. For\nno-one who considers himself as DESERVING hell, can believe that punishment will\nend in peace.\n\nT 15 B 6. The Holy Spirit teaches thus: There IS no hell. Hell is only what the\nego has made OF THE PRESENT. The BELIEF in hell is what PREVENTS you from\nUNDERSTANDING the present, because YOU ARE AFRAID OF IT. The Holy Spirit leads as\nsteadily to Heaven, as the ego drives to hell. For the Holy Spirit, Who knows\nONLY the present, uses it to UNDO the fear by which the ego would make the\npresent useless. There is NO ESCAPE from fear, in the ego's use of time. For\ntime, according to its teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for COMPOUNDING\nguilt, until it becomes all-encompassing, and demands vengeance forever.\n\nThe Holy Spirit would undo ALL of this NOW. Fear is NOT of the\npresent, but ONLY of the past and future, which do not exist. There is no fear in\nthe present, when each instant stands clear and separated from the past, without\nits shadow reaching out into the future. Each instant is a clean, untarnished\nbirth, in which the Son of God emerges FROM the past, into the present. And the\npresent EXTENDS FOREVER. It is so beautiful and so clean and free of guilt, that\nnothing but happiness is there. No darkness is remembered, and his immortality\nand joy are NOW.\n\nThis lesson takes NO time. For what IS time, WITHOUT a past and\nfuture? It HAS taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes no time at\nall to BE what you ARE. Begin to practice the Holy Spirit's USE of time, as a\nteaching aid to happiness and peace. Take this very instant, NOW, and think of it\nas ALL THERE IS of time. Nothing can reach you here, out of the past, and it is\nhere that you are COMPLETELY absolved, COMPLETELY free, and WHOLLY without\ncondemnation. From this holy instant, wherein holiness is born, you will go forth\nin time without fear, and with no sense of change WITH time.\n\nTime is inconceivable without change, and holiness does NOT change.\nLearn from this instant more than merely hell does not exist. IN THIS REDEEMING\nINSTANT LIES HEAVEN. And Heaven will NOT change, for the birth into the holy\npresent is SALVATION from change. And change is an illusion, taught by those who\ncould not see themselves as guiltless. There is no change in Heaven, because\nTHERE IS NO CHANGE IN GOD.\n\nIn the holy instant, in which you see yourself as bright with freedom,\nyou WILL remember God. For remembering Him IS to remember freedom. Whenever you\nare tempted to be dispirited by the thought of HOW LONG it would take to change\nyour mind so completely, ask yourself, “How long is an instant?” Could you not\ngive so SHORT a time to the Holy Spirit, for your Salvation? He asks no more, for\nHe has no need of more. It takes far longer to teach you how to be willing to\nGive Him this, than for Him to use this tiny instant to offer you the whole of\nHeaven. In exchange for this instant, He stands ready to give you the remembrance\nof Eternity.\n\nYou will never give this holy instant to the Holy Spirit on behalf of\nYOUR release, while you are unwilling to give it to your brothers on behalf of\nTHEIRS. For the instant of holiness is SHARED, and CANNOT be yours alone.\nRemember, then, when you are tempted to attack a brother, that HIS instant of\nrelease is YOURS. Miracles ARE the instant of release you offer, and will\nRECEIVE. They attest to YOUR willingness to BE released, and to offer time to the\nHoly Spirit, for HIS use of it. How long is an instant? It is as short for your\nbrothers, as it is for you. Practice GIVING this blessed instant of freedom to\nall who are ENSLAVED by time, and thus make time their friend FOR them.\n\nThe Holy Spirit gives their blessed instant TO you, through your\ngiving it. As you GIVE it, He offers it to YOU. Be not unwilling to give what you\nwould receive of Him, for you join WITH Him in giving. In the crystal cleanness\nof the release you GIVE, is YOUR INSTANTANEOUS escape from guilt. You MUST be\nholy, if you OFFER holiness. How long is an instant? As long as it takes to\nre-establish perfect sanity, perfect peace, and perfect love for everyone, for\nGod, and for YOURSELF. As long as it takes to remember immortality, and your\nimmortal creations, who share it with you. As long as it takes to exchange hell\nfor Heaven. Long enough to transcend ALL of the ego's making, and ascend unto\nyour Father.\n\nTime is your friend, if you leave it to the Holy Spirit to use. He\nneeds but very little, to restore God's Whole power to you. He Who transcends\ntime FOR you, understands what it is FOR. Holiness lies not in time, but in\nEternity. There never WAS an instant in which God's Son could lose his purity.\nHis changeless state is BEYOND time, for his purity remains forever beyond\nattack, and without variability. Time stands still in his holiness, and changes\nnot. And so it is no longer time at all. For, caught in the single instant of the\neternal sanctity of God's creation, it is TRANSFORMED into forever.\n",

For, unless GOD is bound, you CANNOT be. An instant, offered to the Holy\nSpirit, is offered to God on your behalf, and in that instant, you will awaken\ngently in Him.\n\nIn the blessed instant, you will let go ALL your past learning, and\nthe Holy Spirit will quickly offer you the WHOLE lesson of peace. What can take\ntime, when ALL the obstacles to learning it have been removed? Truth is so far\nbeyond time, that ALL of it happens at once. For as it was created one, so its\noneness depends not on time at all. Be not concerned with time, and fear not the\ninstant of holiness which will remove ALL fear. For the instant of peace is\neternal, BECAUSE it is wholly WITHOUT fear. It WILL come, being the lesson God\ngives you, through the Teacher HE has appointed, to translate time to eternity.\n\nBlessed is God's Teacher, Whose joy it is to teach God's holy Son his\nholiness. His joy is not contained in time. His teaching is for you, BECAUSE His\njoy is yours. Through Him, YOU stand before God's altar, where He gently\ntranslated hell into Heaven. For it is only in Heaven that God would have you be.\nHow long can it take, to be where God would have you? For you ARE where you have\nforever been, and will forever be. All that you have, you have forever. The\nblessed instant reaches out to ENCOMPASS time, as God extends Himself to\nencompass you.\n\nYou who have spent days, hours, and even years, in chaining your\nbrothers TO your egos, in an attempt to support it, and uphold its WEAKNESS, do\nnot perceive the Source of STRENGTH. In the holy instant, you will unchain ALL of\nyour brothers, and refuse to support either THEIR weakness, OR YOUR OWN. You do\nnot realize how much you have MISUSED your brothers, by seeing them as sources of\nEGO support. As a result, they witness TO the ego in your perception, and SEEM to\nprovide reasons for NOT letting it go. Yet they are far stronger, and MUCH more\ncompelling witnesses for the Holy Spirit. And they support His STRENGTH.\n\nIt is, therefore, your choice, whether they support the ego or the\nHoly Spirit IN YOU. And you will know which you have chosen, by THEIR reactions.\nA Son of God who has been released through the Holy Spirit in a brother, IF THE\nRELEASE IS COMPLETE, is ALWAYS recognized. He cannot BE denied. As long as YOU\nremain uncertain, it can be ONLY because you have not given COMPLETE release.\nAnd, because of this, you have not yet given one single instant COMPLETELY to the\nHoly Spirit. For, when you HAVE, you will be SURE you have. You will be sure,\nbecause the witness TO Him will speak so clearly OF Him, that you will hear, and\nUNDERSTAND.\n\nYou WILL doubt, until you hear ONE witness whom you have WHOLLY\nreleased through the Holy Spirit. And then you will doubt no more. The holy\ninstant has not yet happened to you. But it will, and you will recognize it, with\nperfect certainty. No gift of God is recognized in any other\nway. You can practice the mechanics of the holy instant, and will learn much from\ndoing so. But its shining and glittering brilliance, which will literally blind\nyou to this world by its OWN vision, you can NOT supply. And here it is, ALL in\nthis instant, complete, accomplished, and GIVEN WHOLLY.\n\nStart NOW, to practice your little part in SEPARATING OUT the holy\ninstant. You will receive very specific instructions, as you go along. To learn\nto separate out this single second, and begin to experience it as timeless, is to\nbegin to experience yourself as NOT separate. Fear not that you will not be given\nhelp in this. God's Teacher, and His lesson will support your strength. It is\nonly your weakness that will depart from you in this practice, for it is the\npractice of the power of God in you. Use it but for one instant, and you will",

    "content": "Littleness versus Magnitude\n\nBe not content with littleness, but be sure you understand what\nlittleness is, and why you could never BE content with it. Littleness is the\noffering you gave YOURSELF. You offered this in place of magnitude, AND ACCEPTED\nIT. Everything in this world is little, because it is a world made out of\nlittleness, in the strange belief that littleness CAN content you. When you\nstrive for anything in the world, WITH THE BELIEF THAT IT WILL BRING YOU PEACE,\nyou are belittling yourself, and blinding yourself to glory. Littleness and glory\nare the choices open to your striving and your vigilance. You will ALWAYS choose\none AT THE EXPENSE of the other.\n\nBut what you do not realize, each time you choose, is that your choice\nis your evaluation OF YOURSELF. Choose littleness, and you will NOT have peace,\nfor you will have judged yourself UNWORTHY of it. And whatever you offer as a\nsubstitute, is much too poor a gift to satisfy you. It is essential that you\naccept the fact, and accept it gladly, that there is NO form of littleness that\ncan EVER content you. You are free to try as many as you wish, but all you will\nbe doing is to delay your homecoming. For you will be content ONLY in magnitude,\nwhich IS your home.\n\nThere is a deep responsibility you owe yourself, and one which you\nmust learn to remember ALL the time. The lesson will seem hard at first, but you\nwill learn to love it, when you realize that it is true, and constitutes a\ntribute to your power. You who have sought AND FOUND littleness, remember this:\nEvery decision that you make stems from WHAT YOU THINK YOU ARE, and represents\nthe value that you PUT upon yourself. Believe the little can content you, and, by\nLIMITING yourself, you will NOT be satisfied. For your function is NOT little,\nand it is only by finding your function, and fulfilling it that you can ESCAPE\nfrom littleness.\n\nThere is no doubt about what your function IS, for the Holy Spirit\nKNOWS what it is. There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it reaches you\nthrough Him, FROM Magnitude. You do not have to strive for it, because you HAVE\nit. All your striving must be directed AGAINST LITTLENESS, for it DOES\nrequire vigilance to protect your magnitude in this world. To hold your magnitude\nin perfect awareness, in a world of littleness, is a task the little cannot\nundertake. Yet it is asked of you, in tribute to your magnitude, and NOT your\nlittleness. Nor is it asked of you alone.\n\nThe power of God will support every effort you make on behalf of the\nmagnitude of His dear Son. Search for the little, and you DENY yourself His\npower. God is not willing that His Son be content with less than everything. For\nHe is not content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less than\nHis Father has given him. We asked you once before, “Would you be hostage to the\nego or host to God?” Let this question be asked you by the Holy Spirit in you,\nEVERY time you make a decision. For every decision you make DOES answer this, and\ninvites sorrow or joy, accordingly.\n\nWhen God GAVE Himself to you in your creation, He ESTABLISHED you as\nhost to Him forever. He has NOT left you, and YOU have not left HIM. All your\nattempts to deny His magnitude, and make His Son hostage to the ego, CANNOT make\nlittle whom God has joined with Him. Every decision you make is made for Heaven\nor for hell, and will bring you AWARENESS of what you decided FOR. The Holy\nSpirit can hold your magnitude, clean of ALL littleness, clearly and in perfect\nsafety in your minds, untouched by every little gift the world of littleness\nwould offer you. But for this, you cannot side AGAINST Him in what He wills for\nyou.\n\nDecide for God through Him. For littleness, and the belief that you\ncan be CONTENT with littleness, are the decisions YOU have made about yourself.\nThe power and the glory that lie in you, from God, are for all who, like you,\nperceive themselves as little, and have deceived themselves into believing that\nlittleness can be blown up, BY THEM, into a sense of magnitude that can content\nthem. Neither GIVE littleness, nor ACCEPT it. All honor is due the host of God.\nYour littleness deceives you, but your magnitude is of Him Who dwells in you, and\nin Whom you dwell. Touch no-one, then, with littleness, in the Name of Christ,\neternal Host unto His Father.\n\nIn this season, which celebrates the birth of holiness into this\nworld, join with me who decided for holiness for YOU. It is our task TOGETHER to\nrestore the awareness of magnitude, to the host whom God appointed for Himself.\nIt is beyond ALL your littleness to give the gift of God, but NOT beyond YOU. For\nGod would give Himself THROUGH you. He reaches from you to everyone, and beyond\neveryone, to His Son's creations, but WITHOUT leaving you. Far beyond your little\nworld, but still in you, He extends forever. Yet He brings all his extensions to\nyou, as host to Him.\n\nIs it a sacrifice to leave littleness behind, and wander not in vain?\nIt is not sacrifice to wake to glory. But it IS a sacrifice to accept anything\nLESS than glory. Learn that you MUST be worthy of the Prince of Peace, born in\nyou, in honor of Him Whose host you are. You know not what love means because you\nhave sought to purchase it with little gifts, thus VALUING it too little to be\nable to understand its magnitude. LOVE IS NOT LITTLE, and love dwells in you, for\nyou are host to Him. Before the greatness that lives in you, your poor\nappreciation of yourself, and all the little offerings you have given, slip into\nnothingness.\n\nHoly Child of God, when will you learn that ONLY holiness can content\nyou, and give you peace? Remember that you learn not for yourself alone, no more\nthan I did. It is BECAUSE I learned for YOU, that you can learn of ME. I would\nbut teach you what is yours, so that, together, we can replace the shabby\nlittleness, that binds the host of God to guilt and weakness, with the glad\nawareness of the glory that is in him. My birth in you is your awakening to\ngrandeur. Welcome me not into a manger, but into the altar to holiness, where\nholiness abides in perfect peace.\n\nMy Kingdom is not of this world, because it is in YOU. And YOU are of\nyour Father. Let us join in honoring you, who MUST remain forever BEYOND\nlittleness. Decide with me, who have decided to abide with you. I will as my\nFather wills, knowing His Will is constant, and at peace forever with Itself. You\nwill be content with nothing BUT His Will. Accept no less, remembering that\neverything I learned is yours. What my Father loves, I love as He does, and I can\nno more accept it as what it is NOT, than He can. And no more can YOU.\n\nWhen you have learned to accept what you are, you will make no more\ngifts to offer to yourselves, for you will know you are COMPLETE, in need of\nnothing, and unable to accept ANYTHING for yourself. But you will gladly give,\nHAVING received. The host of God need not seek to find ANYTHING. If you are\nwholly willing to leave Salvation to the plan of God, and UNwilling to attempt to\ngrasp for peace YOURSELF, Salvation will be GIVEN you. But think not you can\nsubstitute YOUR plan for His. Rather, join with me in His, that we may release\nall those who would be bound, proclaiming together that the Son of God is host to\nHim.\n\nThus will we let no-one forget what YOU would remember. And thus WILL\nyou remember it. Call forth in everyone ONLY the remembrance of God, and of the\nHeaven that is in him. For where you would help your brother be, there will you\nthink YOU are. Hear not his call for hell and littleness, but only his call for\nHeaven and greatness. Forget not that his call is yours, and answer him with me.",

    "content": "Practicing the Holy Instant\n\nThis course is not beyond IMMEDIATE learning, unless you prefer to\nbelieve that WHAT GOD WILLS TAKES TIME. And this means ONLY that you would rather\nDELAY the recognition that His Will IS so. The holy instant is THIS\none, and EVERY one. The one you WANT it to be, it IS. The one you would NOT have\nit be, is lost to you. YOU must decide on WHEN it is. Delay it not. For beyond\nthe past and future, in which you will NOT find it, it stands in shimmering\nreadiness for your acceptance.\n\nYet you cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not want it,\nfor it holds the whole RELEASE from littleness. Your practice MUST therefore rest\nupon your willingness to let all littleness go. The instant in which magnitude\nwill dawn upon you, is but as far away as your DESIRE for it. As long as you\ndesire it not, and cherish littleness instead, by so much is it far from you. By\nso much as you want it, will you bring it nearer. Think not that you can find\nSalvation in your own way, and HAVE it.\n\nGive over EVERY plan that you have made for your Salvation, in\nexchange for God's. HIS will content you, for there IS nothing else that can\nbring you peace. For peace is of God, and of no-one beside Him. Be humble before\nHim, and yet great IN Him. And value NO plan of the ego, BEFORE the plan of God.\nFor you leave your place in His plan, which you MUST fulfill if you would join\nwith me, empty by your decision to join in any plan BUT His. I call you to\nfulfill your holy part in the plan that He has given to the world, for its\nrelease from littleness. God would have His host abide in perfect freedom.\n\nEvery allegiance to a plan of Salvation that is APART from Him,\ndiminishes the value of His Will for you in your own minds. And yet, it is your\nmind that IS the host to Him. Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the\nholy altar on which your Father has placed HIMSELF? This you WILL recognize, in\nthe holy instant in which you willingly and gladly give over EVERY plan but His.\nFor there lies peace, PERFECTLY clear, because you have been willing to meet its\nconditions.\n\nYou can claim the holy instant ANY time and ANYWHERE you want it. In\nyour practice, try to give over EVERY plan you have accepted, for finding\nmagnitude in littleness. IT IS NOT THERE. USE the holy instant ONLY to recognize\nthat you alone CANNOT know where it is, and can only DECEIVE yourself. I stand\nwithin the holy instant, as clear as you would have me. And the extent to which\nyou learn to be willing to ACCEPT me, IS the measure of the time in which the\nholy instant will be yours. I call to you to make the holy instant yours AT ONCE,\nfor the release from littleness in the mind of the host of God, depends on\nwillingness, and NOT on time.\n\nThe reason why this course is simple, is that TRUTH is simple.\nComplexity is of the ego, and is nothing more than the ego's attempt to obscure\nthe obvious. You could live forever in the holy instant, BEGINNING NOW and\nreaching to eternity, but for a very simple reason. Do not obscure the simplicity\nof this reason, for, if you do, it will be ONLY because you prefer NOT to\nrecognize it, and NOT to let it go. The simple reason, stated simply as what it\nis, is this: The holy instant is a time in which you receive AND GIVE perfect\ncommunication. This means, however, that it is a time in which your mind is OPEN,\nboth to receive AND give. It is the recognition that all minds ARE in\ncommunication. It therefore seeks to CHANGE nothing, but merely to ACCEPT\neverything.\n\nHow can you do this when you would prefer to have PRIVATE thoughts,\nAND KEEP THEM? The ONLY way you COULD do this, is to DENY the perfect\ncommunication that makes the holy instant WHAT IT IS. You BELIEVE that it is\npossible to harbor thoughts you would NOT share, and that Salvation lies in\nkeeping your thoughts TO YOURSELF ALONE. For, in private thoughts, KNOWN ONLY TO\nYOURSELF, you think you find a way to keep what you would HAVE alone, and share\nwhat YOU would share.\nAnd then you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication with those\naround you, and with God, Who surrounds ALL of you together.\n\nEvery thought you would keep hidden shuts communication off, BECAUSE\nYOU WOULD HAVE IT SO. It is impossible to RECOGNIZE perfect communication, while\nBREAKING communication holds value to you. Ask yourselves honestly, “Would I WANT\nto have perfect communication, and am I WHOLLY willing to let EVERYTHING that\nINTERFERES WITH IT, go forever?” If the answer is “no,” then the Holy Spirit's\nreadiness to GIVE it to you, is not enough to make it yours, for you are NOT\nready to share it WITH Him. And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to\nOPPOSE it. For the holy instant is given and received with EQUAL willingness,\nbeing the acceptance of the SINGLE Will that governs ALL thought.\n\nThe necessary condition for the holy instant, does NOT require that\nyou have no thoughts that are not pure. But it DOES require that you have none\nthat you would KEEP. Innocence is not of your making. It is GIVEN you, the\ninstant you would HAVE it. But it would not BE Atonement, if there were no NEED\nfor Atonement. You will not be able to ACCEPT perfect communication, as long as\nyou would HIDE it from yourself. For what you would hide IS hidden. In your\npractice, then, try only to be vigilant AGAINST DECEPTION, and seek not to\nPROTECT the thoughts you would keep unto yourself. Let the Holy Spirit's purity",

    "content": "The Holy Instant and Special Relationships\n\nThe holy instant is the Holy Spirit's most useful learning device for\nteaching you love's meaning. For its purpose is to SUSPEND JUDGMENT ENTIRELY.\nJudgment ALWAYS rests on the past, for PAST experience is the basis on which you\njudge. Judgment becomes impossible without the past, for WITHOUT it you do NOT\nunderstand anything. You would make no ATTEMPT to judge, because it would be\nquite apparent to you that you do not know WHAT ANYTHING MEANS. You are afraid of\nthis, because you believe that, WITHOUT THE EGO, all would be chaos. Yet I assure\nyou that, without the ego, ALL WOULD BE LOVE.\n\nThe past is the EGO'S chief learning device, for it is in the past\nthat you learned to define your OWN needs, and acquired methods for meeting them\nON YOUR OWN TERMS. We said before that, to limit love to PART of the Sonship, is\nto bring guilt into your relationships, and thus MAKE THEM UNREAL. If you seek to\nseparate out certain ASPECTS of the totality, and look TO THEM to meet your\nimagined needs, you are attempting to USE SEPARATION TO SAVE YOU. How, then,\ncould guilt NOT enter? For separation IS the source of guilt, and to APPEAL to it\nfor salvation IS TO BELIEVE YOU ARE ALONE.\n\nTo be alone IS to be guilty. For to experience yourself AS alone, is\nto deny the Oneness of the Father and His Son, and thus to ATTACK REALITY. You\ncannot love PARTS of reality, and understand what love MEANS. If you would love\nUNlike to God, Who KNOWS no special love, how CAN you understand it? To believe\nthat SPECIAL relationships, with SPECIAL love, can offer you salvation, IS the\nbelief that separation is salvation. For it is the COMPLETE EQUALITY of the\nAtonement, in which salvation lies. How can YOU decide that special aspects of\nthe Sonship CAN GIVE YOU MORE THAN OTHERS? The past HAS taught you this. But the\nholy instant teaches you IT IS NOT SO.\n\nBecause of guilt, ALL special relationships have some elements of fear\nin them. And this is why they shift and change so frequently. They are NOT based\non changeless love alone. And love, where fear has entered, CANNOT be depended\non, because it is NOT perfect. In His function as Interpreter of what you have\nmade, the Holy Spirit USES special relationships, which YOU have chosen to\nsupport the ego, as a learning experience which points to truth. Under His\nteaching, EVERY relationship becomes a lesson in love.\n\nThe Holy Spirit knows NO-ONE IS SPECIAL. But He also perceives that\nyou have MADE special relationships, which He would purify, and NOT let YOU\ndestroy. However UNholy the reason why you made them may be, He can TRANSLATE\nthem into holiness, by removing AS MUCH FEAR AS YOU WILL LET HIM. You can place\nANY relationship under His care, and be sure that it will NOT result in pain, if\nyou offer Him your willingness TO HAVE IT SERVE NO NEED BUT HIS. All the guilt in\nit arises from YOUR use of it. All the love, from His. Do not, then, be AFRAID to\nlet your IMAGINED need, which would DESTROY the relationship, go. Your ONLY need\nIS His.\n\nAny relationship which you would SUBSTITUTE FOR ANOTHER, has not been\noffered to the Holy Spirit, for His use. There IS no substitute for love. If you\nwould attempt to substitute ONE aspect of love for ANOTHER, you have placed LESS\nvalue on one, and MORE on another. You have not only SEPARATED them, but have\nalso JUDGED AGAINST BOTH. Yet you had judged against yourself FIRST, or you would\nnever have imagined that you needed them AS THEY WERE NOT. Unless you had seen\nyourself as WITHOUT love, you COULD not have judged them to be LIKE you in lack.\n\nThe ego's use of relationships is so fragmented, that it frequently\ngoes even further; one PART of one aspect suits its purposes, while it prefers\nDIFFERENT parts of another. Thus does it ASSEMBLE reality to its own capricious\nliking, offering for YOUR seeking, a picture whose likeness DOES NOT EXIST. For\nthere is nothing in Heaven OR earth that it resembles,\nand so, however much you seek for its reality, you CANNOT find it, because it is\nNOT real.\n\nEveryone on earth has formed special relationships, and, although this\nis not so in Heaven, the Holy Spirit knows how to bring a touch of Heaven to them\nhere. In the holy instant, no-one is special, for your PERSONAL needs INTRUDE on\nno-one, to MAKE them different. Without the values from the past you WOULD see\nthem all the same, and LIKE YOURSELF. Nor would you see ANY separation between\nyourself and them. In the holy instant, you see, in each relationship, what it\nWILL be, when you perceive ONLY the present.\n\nGod knows you NOW. He remembers NOTHING, having ALWAYS known you\nexactly as He knows you now. The holy instant PARALLELS His knowing, by bringing\nALL perception OUT of the past, thus removing the frame of reference you have\nbuilt, by which to JUDGE your brothers. Once this is gone, the Holy Spirit\nsubstitutes His frame of reference FOR it. His frame of reference is simply God.\nThe Holy Spirit's timelessness lies simply here. For in the holy instant, FREE of\nthe past, you see that LOVE IS IN YOU, and you HAVE no need to look WITHOUT, and\nsnatch it guiltily from where you THOUGHT it was.\n\nALL your relationships are blessed in the holy instant, BECAUSE THE\nBLESSING IS NOT LIMITED. In the holy instant, the Sonship gains AS ONE. And,\nUNITED in your blessing, it BECOMES one TO YOU. The meaning of love is the\nmeaning God GAVE to it. Give to it ANY meaning APART from His, and it is\nIMPOSSIBLE to understand it. Every brother God loves as He loves you; neither\nless nor more. HE NEEDS THEM ALL EQUALLY, and so do YOU. In time, you have been\ntold to offer miracles as Christ directs, and let the Holy Spirit bring to you\nthose who are seeking you. But in the holy instant, you unite DIRECTLY with God,\nand ALL your brothers join in Christ.\n\nThose who are joined in Christ are in no way separate. For Christ is\nthe Self the Sonship shares, as God shares His Self with Christ. Think you that\nyou can judge the Self of God? God has created It BEYOND judgment, out of HIS\nneed to extend His love. With Love in you, you HAVE no need EXCEPT TO EXTEND IT.\nIn the holy instant, there is no conflict of needs, for there is ONLY ONE. For\nthe holy instant reaches to eternity, and to the Mind of God. And it is only\nthere that love HAS meaning, and ONLY there CAN it be understood.\n\nIt is impossible to use one relationship AT THE EXPENSE of another,\nand NOT suffer guilt. And it is equally impossible to condemn PART of a\nrelationship and find peace WITHIN it. Under the Holy Spirit's teaching, ALL\nrelationships are seen as TOTAL commitments, yet they do not conflict with one\nanother in ANY way. Perfect faith in each one, for its ability to satisfy you\nCOMPLETELY, arises only from perfect faith in YOURSELF. And this you cannot have,\nwhile guilt remains. And there WILL be guilt, as long as you accept the\npossibility, AND CHERISH IT, that you can make a brother WHAT HE IS NOT, because\nYOU would have him so.\n\nYou have so little faith in yourself, because you are unwilling to\naccept the fact that perfect love is IN you. And so you seek WITHOUT for what you\nCANNOT find without. I offer you MY perfect faith in you, IN PLACE of all YOUR\ndoubts. But forget not that my faith MUST be as perfect in ALL your brothers as\nit is in you, or it would be a limited gift to YOU. In the holy instant, we SHARE",

    "content": "The Holy Instant and the Laws of God\n\nAll separation vanishes, as holiness is shared. For holiness is power,\nand by SHARING it, it GAINS in strength. If you seek for satisfaction in\ngratifying your needs as YOU perceive them, you MUST believe that strength comes\nfrom ANOTHER, and that WHAT YOU GAIN HE LOSES. Someone must ALWAYS lose, if you\nperceive yourself as weak. Yet there is another interpretation of relationships,\nthat TRANSCENDS the concept of the LOSS of power completely.\n\nYou do NOT find it difficult to believe that, when ANOTHER calls on\nGod for love, YOUR call remains as strong. Nor do you think that, by God's answer\nto HIM, YOUR hope of answer is diminished. On the contrary, you are far more\ninclined to regard HIS success, as witness to the possibility of YOURS. That is\nbecause you recognize, however dimly, that God is an IDEA, and so YOUR faith in\nHim is STRENGTHENED by sharing. What you find it difficult to accept is the fact\nthat, LIKE your Father, YOU are an idea. And like Him, YOU can give yourself\nCOMPLETELY, wholly without loss, and ONLY WITH GAIN.\n\nHerein lies peace, for here there IS no conflict. In the world of\nscarcity, love HAS no meaning, and peace is impossible. For gain and loss are\nBOTH accepted, and so no-one is aware that perfect Love is IN him. In the holy\ninstant, you recognize the IDEA of love in you, and UNITE this idea with the Mind\nthat thought It, AND COULD NOT RELINQUISH IT. By HOLDING it within Itself, THERE\nWAS no loss. The holy instant thus becomes a lesson in how to hold ALL of your\nbrothers in YOUR mind, experiencing not loss, but COMPLETION.\n\nFrom this, it follows you can ONLY give. And this IS love, for this\nalone is natural, under the laws of God. In the holy instant, the laws of God\nprevail, and only THEY have meaning. The laws of this world cease to\nhold any meaning at all. When the Son of God ACCEPTS the laws of God as what he\ngladly wills, it is impossible that he be bound, or limited in ANY way. In this\ninstant, he IS as free as God would have him be. For, the instant that he refuses\nto BE bound, he is NOT bound.\n\nIn the holy instant, nothing happens that has not always been. Only\nthe veil, that has been drawn ACROSS reality, is lifted. Nothing has changed. But\nthe AWARENESS of changelessness comes swiftly, as the veil of time is pushed\naside. No-one who has not yet experienced the lifting of the veil, and felt\nhimself drawn irresistibly into the Light behind it, can have faith in love\nWITHOUT fear. Yet the Holy Spirit GIVES you this faith, because He offered it to\nme and I ACCEPTED it.\n\nFear not the holy instant will be denied you, for I denied IT not.\nAnd, through me, the Holy Spirit GAVE it unto you, as YOU will give it. Let no\nneed that YOU perceive, obscure your need of THIS. For, in the holy instant, you\nwill recognize the ONLY need the aspects of the Son of God share equally, and, BY\nthis recognition, you will join with me in OFFERING what is needed. It is through\nUS that peace will come. Join me in the IDEA of peace, for, in ideas, minds CAN\ncommunicate.\n\nIf you would GIVE YOURSELF as your Father gives His Self, you will\nlearn to understand Selfhood. And therein is love's meaning understood. But\nremember that understanding is OF THE MIND, and, ONLY of the mind. KNOWLEDGE is\ntherefore of the mind, and its CONDITIONS are in the mind, WITH it. If you were\nnot ONLY an idea, and NOTHING ELSE, you could not be in full communication with\nall that ever was. But, as long as you prefer to be something else, or would\nattempt to be NOTHING ELSE and SOMETHING ELSE together, the language of\ncommunication, WHICH YOU KNOW PERFECTLY, you will not remember.\n\nIn the holy instant, God is remembered, and the language of\ncommunication with ALL your brothers, is remembered WITH Him. For communication\nis remembered TOGETHER, as is truth. There is NO exclusion in the holy instant,\nbecause the past is gone, and, with it, goes the whole basis FOR exclusion.\nWithout ITS source, exclusion vanishes. And this permits YOUR Source, and that of\nall your brothers, to REPLACE it in your awareness. God, and the power of God,\nwill take their rightful place in you, and you will experience the full",

    "content": "The Holy Instant and Communication\n\nBeyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship, and\nALWAYS obscured by it, is the powerful attraction of the Father for His Son.\nThere is no OTHER love that can satisfy you, because there IS no other love. This\nis the ONLY love that is fully given, AND FULLY RETURNED. Being complete, it asks\nnothing. Being wholly pure, everyone joined in it HAS everything. This is NOT the\nbasis for ANY love relationship in which the ego enters. For EVERY relationship\non which the ego embarks IS special. The ego establishes relationships ONLY to\nGET something. And it would keep the giver BOUND TO ITSELF, through guilt.\n\nIt is impossible for the ego to enter into any relationship without\nanger, for the ego believes that ANGER MAKES FRIENDS. This is NOT its statement,\nbut it IS its purpose. For the ego REALLY BELIEVES that it can get, and KEEP, by\nMAKING GUILTY. This is its ONE attraction. An attraction so weak, that it would\nhave no hold at all, except that NO-ONE RECOGNIZES IT. For the ego always SEEMS\nto attract through love, and has no attraction at all to anyone who perceives\nthat IT ATTRACTS THROUGH GUILT.\n\nThe sick attraction of guilt MUST be recognized FOR WHAT IT IS. For,\nhaving been made REAL to you, it is essential to look at it clearly, and, by\nwithdrawing your INVESTMENT in it, to LEARN TO LET IT GO. No-one would choose to\nlet go what he believes has value. Yet the attraction of guilt has value to you\nONLY because you have NOT looked at what it IS, and have judged it as valuable\nCOMPLETELY in the dark. As we bring it to light, your ONLY question will be why\nit was you EVER WANTED it. You have NOTHING to lose by looking open-eyed at this,\nfor ugliness such as this belongs not in your holy mind. The host of God CAN have\nno REAL investment here.\n\nWe said before that the ego attempts to maintain and INCREASE guilt,\nbut in such a way, that you do NOT recognize what it would do to YOU. For it is\nthe ego's fundamental doctrine that, what you do to others, YOU HAVE ESCAPED. The\nego wishes NO-ONE well. But its survival DEPENDS on your belief that YOU are\nexempt from its evil intentions. It counsels, therefore, that if you are HOST to\nit, IT will enable you to direct the anger that it holds outward, thus protecting\nYOU. And thus, it embarks on an endless, unrewarding chain of special\nrelationships, forged out of anger, and dedicated to but one insane belief; that\nthe more anger you invest OUTSIDE yourself, the safer YOU become.\n\nIt is this chain that binds the Son of God to guilt, and it is this\nchain the Holy Spirit would REMOVE from his holy mind. For the chain of savagery\nbelongs not around the chosen host of God, who CANNOT make himself host to the\nego. In the name of his release, and in the Name of Him Who would release him,\nlet us look more closely at the relationships that the ego contrives, and let the\nHoly Spirit judge them truly. For it is certain that, if you LOOK at them, you\nwill offer them gladly TO Him. What HE can make of them you do NOT know, but you\nWILL become willing to find out, if you are willing, first, to perceive what YOU\nhave made of them.\n\nIn one way or another, every relationship which the ego makes is based\non the idea that, by SACRIFICING itself, IT BECOMES BIGGER. The “sacrifice,”\nwhich it regards as purification, is actually the root of its bitter resentment.\nFor it would much prefer to attack directly, and avoid delaying what it REALLY\nwants. Yet the ego acknowledges “reality” as it sees it, and recognizes that NOONE\ncould interpret DIRECT attack as love. Yet to make guilty IS direct attack,\nbut does not SEEM to be. For the guilty EXPECT attack, and, having ASKED for it,\nthey are ATTRACTED to it.\n\nIn these insane relationships, the attraction of what you do NOT want\nseems to be much stronger than the attraction of what you DO. For each one thinks\nthat he has SACRIFICED something to the other, AND HATES HIM FOR IT. Yet this is\nwhat he thinks he WANTS. He is NOT in love with the other at all; he merely\nbelieves he is IN LOVE WITH SACRIFICE. And FOR this sacrifice, which he demanded\nOF HIMSELF, HE demands the other ACCEPT the guilt, and SACRIFICE HIMSELF as well.\nForgiveness becomes impossible, for the ego believes, that to forgive another, IS\nTO LOSE HIM. For it is only by attack WITHOUT forgiveness, that the ego can\nensure the guilt which holds ALL its relationships together.\n\nYet they only SEEM to be together. For relationships, to the ego, mean\nONLY that BODIES are together. It is always PHYSICAL closeness that the ego\ndemands, and it does not object where the mind goes, or what it thinks, for this\nseems unimportant. For, as long as the BODY is there, to receive its sacrifice,\nit is content. To the ego, THE MIND IS PRIVATE, and only the body CAN be shared.\nIdeas are basically of no concern, except as they draw the BODY of another closer\nor farther. And it is in these terms that it evaluates ideas as “good” or “bad.”\nWhat makes another guilty, AND HOLDS HIM THROUGH GUILT, is “good.” What releases\nhim FROM guilt is “bad,” because he would no longer believe that BODIES\ncommunicate, and so he would be “gone.”\n\nSuffering and sacrifice are the gifts with which the ego would “bless”\nall unions. And those who are united at its altar ACCEPT suffering and sacrifice\nas the PRICE of union. In their angry alliances, born of the fear of loneliness,\nand yet dedicated to the CONTINUANCE of loneliness, they seek RELIEF from guilt,\nby INCREASING it in the other. For they believe that this DECREASES it in them.\nThe other seems always to be attacking and wounding them, perhaps in little ways,\nperhaps “unconsciously,” yet never without demand of sacrifice. The fury of those\njoined at the ego's altar, far exceeds your awareness of it. For what the ego\nreally, wants you do NOT realize.\n\nWhenever you are angry, you can be sure that you have formed a special\nrelationship which the ego has “blessed,” for anger IS its “blessing.” Anger\ntakes many forms, but it cannot long deceive those who will learn that LOVE\nBRINGS NO GUILT AT ALL, and what brings guilt CANNOT be love, and MUST be anger.\nALL anger is nothing more than an attempt to MAKE SOMEONE FEEL GUILTY, and this\nattempt is the ONLY basis which the ego accepts for special relationships. Guilt\nis the only need the ego has, and, as long as you identify WITH it, guilt will\nremain ATTRACTIVE to you.\n\nBut remember this; to be WITH A BODY is NOT communication. And, if you\nthink it IS, you will feel guilty about COMMUNICATION, and will be AFRAID to hear\nthe Holy Spirit, recognizing in His voice, your OWN need to communicate. The Holy\nSpirit CANNOT teach through fear. And how can He communicate with you, while you\nbelieve that, to communicate, is to MAKE YOURSELF ALONE? It is CLEARLY insane to\nbelieve that, by communicating, you will be abandoned. And yet, you DO believe\nit. For you think that your minds must be kept PRIVATE, or you will LOSE them.\nAnd, if your BODIES are together, your minds remain your own.\n\nThe union of bodies thus becomes the way in which you would KEEP MINDS\nAPART. For bodies cannot forgive. They can do only as the mind directs. The\nillusion of the autonomy of the body, and ITS ability to overcome loneliness, is\nbut the working of the ego's plan to establish its OWN autonomy. As long as you\nbelieve that, to be with a body, is companionship, you will be COMPELLED to\nattempt to keep your brother IN his body, HELD THERE BY GUILT. And you will see\nSAFETY IN GUILT, and DANGER IN COMMUNICATION. For the ego will ALWAYS teach that\nloneliness is solved by guilt, and that communication is the CAUSE of loneliness.\nAnd, despite the evident insanity of this lesson, YOU HAVE LEARNED IT.\n\nForgiveness lies in communication, as surely as damnation lies in\nguilt. It is the Holy Spirit's teaching function to instruct those who\nbelieve that communication is damnation, that communication is salvation. And He\nwill do so, for the power of God in Him AND YOU is joined in REAL relationship,\nso holy and so strong, that it can overcome even this, WITHOUT fear. It is\nthrough the holy instant that what SEEMS impossible is ACCOMPLISHED, making it",

    "content": "The Holy Instant and Real Relationships\n\nHere, there is no concealment, and no private thoughts. The\nWILLINGNESS to communicate attracts communication TO it, and overcomes loneliness\ncompletely. There is complete forgiveness here, for there is no desire to exclude\nANYONE from your completion, in sudden recognition of the value of his part in\nit. In the protection of YOUR wholeness, all are invited and made welcome. And\nyou understand that YOUR completion is God's, Whose only need is to have you Be\ncomplete. For your completion MAKES you His, in YOUR awareness. And here it is\nthat you experience yourself as you were created, AND AS YOU ARE.\n\nThe holy instant does not REPLACE the need for learning, for the Holy\nSpirit must not leave you as your Teacher, until the holy instant has extended\nfar beyond time. For a teaching assignment such as His, He must use EVERYTHING in\nthis world for your release. He must side with EVERY sign or token of your\nwillingness to learn of Him what truth MUST be. He is swift to utilize WHATEVER\nyou offer Him, on behalf of this. His concern and care for you are limitless. In\nthe face of your fear of forgiveness, which He perceives as clearly as He knows\nforgiveness IS release, He will teach you to remember always that forgiveness is\nNOT loss, BUT YOUR SALVATION. And that, in COMPLETE forgiveness, in which you\nrecognize that there is nothing to forgive, YOU are absolved completely.\n\nHear Him gladly, and learn of Him that you have need of no special\nrelationships at all. You but seek in them what you have THROWN AWAY. And,\nthrough THEM, you will never learn the value of what you have cast aside, but\nwhat you still desire with all your hearts. Let us join together in making the\nholy instant all that there is, by desiring that it BE all that there is. God's\nSon has such great need of your willingness to strive for this, that you cannot\nconceive of need so great. Behold the only need that God and His Son share, and\nwill to meet together. You are NOT alone in this. The will of your creations\ncall to you, to share your will with them. Turn, then, in peace, from guilt to\nGod and them.\n\nRelate only with what will never LEAVE you, and what YOU cannot leave.\nThe loneliness of God's Son is the loneliness of his Father. Refuse not the\nawareness of your completion, and seek not to restore it to yourselves. Fear not\nto give redemption over to your Redeemer's love. He will NOT fail you, for He\ncomes from One Who CANNOT fail. Accept YOUR sense of failure as nothing more than\na mistake in WHO YOU WERE. For the holy host of God is BEYOND failure, and\nNOTHING that he wills can BE denied. You are forever in a relationship so holy,\nthat it calls to everyone to ESCAPE from loneliness, and join you in your Love.\nAnd where YOU are must everyone seek, and FIND you there.\n\nThink but an instant on this; God gave the Sonship to you, to ensure\nyour perfect creation. This was His Gift, for, as He withheld Himself not from\nyou, He withheld not His creation. Nothing that ever was created, but is not\nyours. Your relationships are with the universe. And this universe, being of God,\nis far beyond the petty sum of all the separate bodies YOU perceive. For all its\nparts are joined in God through Christ, where they become like to their Father.\nFor Christ knows of no separation FROM His Father, Who is His One relationship,\nin which He gives as His Father gives to Him.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is God's attempt to free you of what He does not\nunderstand. And, because of the Source of the attempt, IT WILL SUCCEED. The Holy\nSpirit asks you to respond as God does, for He would teach you what YOU do not\nunderstand. God would respond to EVERY need, WHATEVER form it takes. And so He\nhas kept this Channel open to receive His communication to you, AND YOURS TO HIM.\nGod does NOT understand your problem in communication, for He does NOT share it\nwith you. It is only YOU, who believe that it IS understandable.\n\nThe Holy Spirit KNOWS that it is not understandable, and yet He\nUNDERSTANDS it, because you have MADE it. In Him alone, lies the awareness of\nwhat God CANNOT know, and what YOU do NOT understand. It is His holy function to\nACCEPT THEM BOTH, and, by removing EVERY element of DISagreement, to join them\ninto one. He will do this, BECAUSE it is His function. Leave, then, what seems to\nyou to be impossible, to Him Who knows it MUST be possible, because it is the\nWill of God. And let Him, Whose teaching is ONLY of God, teach you the ONLY\nmeaning of relationships. For God Himself created the only relationship that HAS\nmeaning, and that is His relationship with YOU.\n\nAs the ego would limit your perception of your brothers to the body,\nso would the Holy Spirit RELEASE your vision, and let you see the Great Rays\nshining from them, so unlimited that they reach to God. It is this shift in\nvision which is accomplished in the holy instant. Yet it is needful for you to\nlearn just what this shift entails, so you will become willing to make it\npermanent. Given this willingness, it will NOT leave you, for it IS permanent.\nFor, once you have accepted it as the ONLY PERCEPTION THAT YOU WANT, it is\ntranslated into knowledge, by the part that God Himself plays in the Atonement,\nfor it is the ONLY step in it He understands. Therefore, in this there will be NO\ndelay, when YOU are ready for it. God is ready NOW, but YOU are not.\n\nOur task is but to continue, as fast as possible, the necessary\nprocess of looking straight at ALL the interference, and seeing it EXACTLY as it\nis. For it is impossible to recognize as WHOLLY without gratification, WHAT YOU\nTHINK YOU WANT. The body is the symbol of the ego, as the ego is the symbol of\nseparation. And both are nothing more than attempts to LIMIT communication, and\nthereby TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE. For communication MUST be UNlimited in order to\nHAVE meaning, and DEPRIVED of meaning, it will NOT satisfy YOU completely. Yet it\nremains the ONLY means by which you CAN establish real relationships.\n\nReal relationships HAVE no limits, having been established by God. In\nthe holy instant, where the Great Rays REPLACE the body in awareness, the\nrecognition of relationships WITHOUT limits is given you. But to SEE this, it is\nnecessary to give up EVERY use the ego has for the body, and to accept the fact\nthat the ego has NO purpose you would SHARE with it. For the ego would limit\neveryone TO a body for ITS purposes, and, while you think it HAS a purpose, you\nwill choose to utilize the means by which IT tries to turn its purpose into\naccomplishment. This will never BE accomplished.\n\nYet you have surely recognized that the ego, whose goals are\naltogether UNattainable, will strive for them with all its might. And will do\nso with the strength that YOU have given it. Yet it is impossible to DIVIDE your\nstrength between Heaven and hell, God and the ego, and RELEASE your power unto\ncreation, that is the ONLY purpose for which it was GIVEN you. For love would\nalways give INCREASE. Limits are DEMANDED, representing the ego's demands to make\nlittle and ineffectual. Limit your vision of a brother to his body, which you\nWILL do, as long as you would not release him FROM it, and you have denied HIS\ngift to YOU. HIS BODY CANNOT GIVE IT. And seek it not through YOURS.\n\nBut your minds are ALREADY continuous, and THEIR union need only be\naccepted, and the loneliness in Heaven is gone. If you would but let the Holy\nSpirit tell you of the Love of God for you, and the need that your creations have\nto be with you forever, you would experience the attraction of the Eternal. For\nno-one can hear Him speak of this, and long remain willing to linger here. For it\nIS your will to be in Heaven, where you are complete and quiet, in such sure and\nloving relationships, that ANY limits are impossible. Would you not exchange your\nlittle relationships for this? For the body IS little and limited, and only those\nwhom you would see WITHOUT the limits that the ego would impose on them, can\noffer YOU the gift of freedom.\n\nYou have no conception of the limits you have placed on your\nperception, and no idea of all the loveliness that you COULD see. But this you\nmust remember; the attraction of guilt OPPOSES the attraction of God. His\nattraction for you remains unlimited, but, because your power, BEING His, is AS\nGREAT as His, you can TURN AWAY from love. What you invest in guilt, you withdraw\nfrom God. And your sight grows weak and dim and limited, for you have attempted\nto SEPARATE the Father from the Son, and LIMIT their communication. Seek not\nAtonement in FURTHER separation. And limit not your vision of God's Son to what\nINTERFERES with his release, and what the Holy Spirit must UNDO to set him free.\nFor his belief in limits HAS imprisoned him.",

    "content": "The Time of Christ\n\nWhen the body ceases to attract you, and when you place no value on it\nas a means of GETTING ANYTHING, then there will be NO interference in\ncommunication. And your thoughts will be as free as God's. As you let the Holy\nSpirit teach you how to use the body ONLY for purposes of communication, and\nRENOUNCE its use for separation and attack, which the EGO sees in it, you will\nlearn you have no need of a body at all. In the holy instant, there ARE no\nbodies. And you experience ONLY the attraction of God. Accepting it as undivided,\nyou join Him wholly, in an instant. For you would place NO limits on your union\nWITH Him. The reality of THIS relationship becomes the only truth that you could\never WANT. ALL Truth IS here.\n\nIt IS in your power, IN TIME, to delay the perfect union of the Father\nand the Son. For in this world, the attraction of guilt DOES stand between them.\nNeither time nor season means anything in eternity. But here, it is the Holy\nSpirit's function to use them both, NOT as the ego uses them. This is the season\nwhen you would celebrate my birth into this world. Yet you know not how to do it.\nLet the Holy Spirit teach you, and let ME celebrate YOUR birth through Him. The\nonly gift I can accept of you, is the gift I GAVE you. Release ME, as I willed\nYOUR release. The time of Christ we celebrate TOGETHER. For it HAS no meaning, if\nwe are apart.\n\nThe holy instant is truly the time of Christ. For, in this liberating\ninstant, no guilt is laid upon the Son of God, and his unlimited power is thus\nrestored to him. What OTHER gift can you offer me, when ONLY THIS I will to offer\nYOU? And to see me, is to see me in everyone, and offer everyone the gift you\noffer me. I am incapable of receiving sacrifice as God is. And every sacrifice\nyou ask of YOURSELF, you ask of me. Learn NOW that sacrifice, of ANY kind, is\nnothing but a LIMITATION IMPOSED ON GIVING. And, BY this limitation, you have\nlimited YOUR acceptance of the gift I offer YOU.\n\nWe who are one, cannot give separately. When you are willing to accept\nOUR relationship AS REAL, guilt will hold NO attraction for you. For, in OUR\nunion, you will accept ALL of our brothers. The gift of union is the only gift\nthat I was born to give. Give it to ME, that YOU may have it. The time of Christ\nis the time appointed for the gift of freedom, offered to everyone. And, by YOUR\nacceptance of it, you have offered it TO everyone. It IS in your power to make\nthis season holy. For it is in your power to make the time of Christ be NOW.\n\nIt is possible to do this all at once, because there is but ONE shift\nin perception that is necessary. For you made but ONE mistake. It SEEMS like\nmany, but it is all the same. For, though the ego takes many forms, it is ALWAYS\nthe same idea. What is NOT love is always fear, and nothing else. It is not\nnecessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows\nunderground, and hides in darkness, to emerge in FORMS quite different from what\nit IS. It IS necessary to examine each one, as long as you would retain the\nPRINCIPLE which governs all of them. But when you are willing to regard them, NOT\nas separate, but as DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SAME IDEA, and ONE YOU DO NOT\nWANT, they go together.\n\nThe idea is simply this; you believe that it is possible to be host to\nthe ego, or hostage to God. This is the choice you think you have, and the\ndecision that you believe that you must make. You see no other alternatives. For\nyou can NOT accept the fact that SACRIFICE GETS NOTHING. Sacrifice is so\nessential to your thought-system, that salvation, APART from sacrifice, means\nNOTHING to you. Your confusion of sacrifice and love is so profound that you\ncannot conceive of love WITHOUT sacrifice. And it is THIS that you must look at;\nSACRIFICE IS ATTACK, NOT LOVE. If you would accept but this ONE idea, your fear\nof love would vanish.\n\nGuilt CANNOT last, when the idea of sacrifice has been removed. For,\nif there MUST be sacrifice, as you are convinced, someone must pay, and someone\nmust get. And the ONLY question that remains to BE decided is HOW MUCH is the\nprice, for getting WHAT. As host to the ego, you believe that you can give ALL\nyour guilt away, WHATEVER you think, and purchase peace. For the payment DOES NOT\nSEEM TO BE YOURS. While it is obvious that the ego DOES demand payment, it NEVER\nseems to be demanding it OF YOU. For you are unwilling to recognize that the ego,\nwhich you INVITED, is treacherous only to those who think they are its host.\n\nThe ego will NEVER let you perceive this, for this recognition WILL\nmake it homeless. For, when this recognition dawns clearly, you will NOT be\ndeceived by ANY form the ego takes, to protect itself FROM your sight. Each form\nwill be recognized as but a cover, for the one idea that hides behind them all.\nThat love demands sacrifice, and is therefore INSEPARABLE from attack and fear.\nAnd that GUILT IS THE PRICE OF LOVE, which MUST be paid BY fear. How fearful,\nthen, has God become to you, and how great a sacrifice do you believe His Love\ndemands! For total love would demand total sacrifice. And so the ego seems to\ndemand LESS of you than God, and of the two is judged as the LESSER of two evils,\none to be feared a little, but the Other TO BE DESTROYED.\n\nFor you see love AS DESTRUCTIVE, and your only question is WHO is to\nbe destroyed, you or another? You seek to answer this question in your special\nrelationships, in which you are both destroyer and destroyed IN PART, but with\nthe idea of being able to be neither completely. And this you think SAVES YOU\nFROM GOD, whose TOTAL Love would COMPLETELY destroy you. You think that everyone\nOUTSIDE yourself demands your sacrifice, but you do NOT see that ONLY you demand\nsacrifice, and ONLY of yourself. Yet the demand of sacrifice is so savage and so\nfearful, that you CANNOT accept it WHERE IT IS. But the REAL price of NOT\naccepting this has been so great, that you have GIVEN GOD AWAY, rather than look\nat it.\n\nFor, if GOD would demand total sacrifice of you, you thought it safer\nto project Him outward and AWAY from you, and NOT be host to Him. For to Him you\nascribed the EGO'S treachery, inviting it to take His place, and PROTECT you FROM\nHim. And you do not recognize that it is WHAT YOU INVITED IN that would destroy\nyou, and DOES demand total sacrifice of you. No partial sacrifice will appease\nthis savage guest, for it is an invader who but SEEMS to offer kindness, but\nALWAYS to MAKE THE SACRIFICE COMPLETE. You will NOT succeed in being PARTIAL\nhostage to the ego, for it keeps NO bargains, and would leave you NOTHING. Nor\ncan you be partial HOST to it.\n\nYou will have to choose between TOTAL freedom and TOTAL bondage, for\nthere are no alternatives but these. You have tried many compromises, in the\nattempt to avoid recognizing the one decision that MUST be made. And\nyet, it is the RECOGNITION of the decision, JUST AS IT IS, that makes the\ndecision so easy! Salvation is simple, being of God, and therefore VERY easy to",

    "content": "The End of Sacrifice\n\nFear not to recognize as SOLELY OF YOUR MAKING the whole idea of\nsacrifice. And seek not safety by attempting to PROTECT yourself from where it is\nNOT. Your brothers and your Father have become VERY fearful to you, and you would\nbargain with them for a few special relationships, in which you think you see\nsome scraps of safety. Do not try longer to KEEP APART your thoughts and the\nThought that has been GIVEN you. When they are brought together, and perceived\nWHERE THEY ARE, the choice BETWEEN them is nothing more than a gentle awakening,\nand as simple as opening your eyes to daylight, when you have no more need of\nsleep.\n\nThe sign of Christmas is a star, a light in darkness. See it not\nOUTSIDE of yourself, but as shining in the Heaven within, and accept it as the\nsign the time of Christ has come. He comes demanding NOTHING. No sacrifice of ANY\nkind, of ANYONE, is asked by Him. In His Presence, the whole IDEA of sacrifice\nloses ALL meaning. For He is Host to God. And you need but invite Him in Who is\nthere ALREADY, by recognizing that His Host is One. And no thought ALIEN to His\nOneness can abide with Him there. Love MUST be total to give Him welcome, for the\nPresence of holiness CREATES the holiness which surrounds It. No fear can touch\nthe Host Who cradles God in the time of Christ. For the Host is as holy as the\nPerfect Innocence that He protects, and Whose Power protects HIM.\n\nThis Christmas, give the Holy Spirit EVERYTHING that would hurt you.\nLET yourself be healed completely, that you may JOIN with Him in healing. And let\nus celebrate our release together, by releasing everyone WITH us. Leave nothing\nbehind, for release is TOTAL. And when you have accepted it WITH me, you will\nGIVE it with me. All pain and sacrifice and littleness will disappear in OUR\nrelationship, which is as innocent as our relationship with\nour Father, and as powerful. Pain will be brought to us, and disappear in our\npresence. And, WITHOUT pain, there can BE no sacrifice. And WITHOUT SACRIFICE,\nthere love MUST be.\n\nYou who believe that sacrifice IS love, must learn that sacrifice is\nseparation FROM love. For sacrifice brings guilt, as surely as love brings peace.\nGuilt is the CONDITION of sacrifice, as peace is the condition for the awareness\nof your relationship with God. For through guilt, you EXCLUDE your Father and\nyour brothers FROM yourself. And through peace, you will invite them back, and\nrealize they are where your invitation bids them be. What you excluded from\nyourself seems fearful, for you ENDOWED it with fear, and tried to CAST IT OUT,\nthough it was part of you. Who can perceive part of himself as loathsome, and\nlive within himself in peace? And who can try to resolve the perceived conflict\nof Heaven and hell IN HIM by casting Heaven out, and GIVING IT the attributes of\nhell, WITHOUT experiencing himself as incomplete and lonely?\n\nAs long as you perceive the body as your reality, so long will you\nperceive yourself as lonely and deprived. And so long will you also perceive\nyourself as a VICTIM OF SACRIFICE, JUSTIFIED in sacrificing others. For who could\nthrust Heaven and its Creator aside, WITHOUT a sense of sacrifice and loss? And\nwho can suffer sacrifice and loss, without attempting to RESTORE himself? Yet how\ncould you accomplish this yourselves, when the basis of your attempts is the\nbelief in the REALITY OF THE DEPRIVATION? For deprivation breeds attack, BEING\nthe belief that attack IS justified. And, as long as you would RETAIN the\ndeprivation, attack becomes salvation, and sacrifice becomes love.\n\nSo is it that, in all your seeking for love, YOU SEEK FOR SACRIFICE,\nand FIND it. Yet you find NOT love. For it is impossible to DENY what love IS,\nand still RECOGNIZE it. The meaning of love lies in what you have cast OUTSIDE\nyourself, and it HAS no meaning at all, APART from you. It is what you preferred\nto KEEP, that has no meaning. While all that you would KEEP\nAWAY hold all the meaning of the universe, and holds the universe together in its\nmeaning. For, unless the universe were joined in YOU, it would be APART FROM God,\nand to be without Him IS to be without meaning.\n\nIn the holy instant, the condition of love is met, for minds are\njoined without the body's INTERFERENCE, and where there is communication, there\nis peace. The Prince of Peace was born to re-establish the CONDITION of love, by\nteaching that communication remains unbroken, even if the body is destroyed,\nPROVIDED THAT you see NOT the body as the necessary means of communication. And\nif you UNDERSTAND this lesson, you will realize that, to sacrifice the BODY, is\nto SACRIFICE NOTHING. And communication, which MUST be of the mind, CANNOT be\nsacrificed. Where, then, is sacrifice?\n\nThe lesson I was born to teach, and still would teach to all my\nbrothers, is that sacrifice is nowhere and love is everywhere. For communication\nEMBRACES EVERYTHING, and in the peace it re-establishes, love comes of itself.\nLet no despair darken the joy of Christmas, for the time of Christ is meaningless\nAPART from joy. Let us join in celebrating peace by demanding no sacrifice of\nanyone, for so will you offer me the love I offer you. What can be more joyous\nthan to perceive WE ARE DEPRIVED OF NOTHING? Such is the message of the time of\nChrist, which I give you, that YOU may give it, and return it to the Father, Who\ngave it to me.\n\nFor in the time of Christ, communication with Him is restored, and He\njoins us in the celebration of His Son's Creation. God offers thanks to the holy\nhost who would receive Him, and let Him enter, and abide where He would be. And\nBY your welcome, does HE welcome you into Himself. For what is contained in you\nwho welcome Him is RETURNED to Him. And we but celebrate HIS Wholeness, as we\nwelcome Him into ourselves. Those who receive the Father are one with Him, being\nhost to Him Who created them. And by allowing Him to enter, the remembrance of\nthe Father enters with Him, and with Him they remember the only relationship they\never had, and ever want to have.\n\nThis is the week-end in which a new year will be born from the time of\nChrist. I have perfect faith in you, to do all that you would accomplish. Nothing\nwill be lacking, and you will MAKE COMPLETE, and NOT destroy. Say and UNDERSTAND\nthis:\n\nI give you to the Holy Spirit, as part of myself.\n\nI know that you will be released, UNLESS I WANT TO USE YOU TO IMPRISON MYSELF.\n\nIn the name of MY freedom, I WILL your release,\n\nBecause I recognize that we will be released TOGETHER.\n\nSo will the year begin in joy and freedom. There is much to do, and we have been\nlong delayed. Accept the holy instant as this year is born, and take your place,\nso long left unfulfilled, in the Great Awakening. Make this year different, by\nmaking it ALL THE SAME. And let ALL your relationships be made holy FOR you. This",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nTo empathize does NOT mean to JOIN IN SUFFERING, for this is what you\nmust REFUSE to understand. This is the EGO'S interpretation of empathy, and is\nALWAYS used to form a special relationship, in which SUFFERING is shared. The\nCAPACITY to empathize is VERY useful to the Holy Spirit, provided you let Him use\nit in His way. His way is very different. He does NOT understand suffering, and\nwould have you teach IT IS NOT UNDERSTANDABLE. When He relates through you, He\ndoes NOT relate through the ego to another ego. He does NOT join in pain, knowing\nthat HEALING pain is NOT accomplished by delusional attempts to ENTER INTO IT,\nand lighten it by SHARING the delusion.\n\nThe clearest proof that empathy, as the ego uses it, is DESTRUCTIVE,\nlies in the fact that it is applied ONLY to certain types of problems, and in\ncertain people. These it SELECTS OUT and JOINS WITH. And it NEVER joins, except\nto strengthen itself. Having identified with what it THINKS it understands, it\nsees ITSELF, and would INCREASE itself by sharing what is LIKE itself. Make no\nmistake about this maneuver; the ego always EMPATHIZES TO WEAKEN. And to weaken\nis ALWAYS to attack.\n\nYou do NOT know what empathizing means. But of this you may be sure;\nif you will merely sit quietly by, and let the Holy Spirit relate THROUGH you,\nyou will EMPATHIZE WITH STRENGTH, and both of you will gain in strength, and NOT\nin weakness. Your part is only to remember this; you do not want anything that\nYOU value to come of the relationship. You will neither to hurt it, NOR TO HEAL\nIT in your own way. You do NOT know what healing IS. All you have learned of\nempathy IS FROM THE PAST. And there is NOTHING from the past that you would\nshare, for there is nothing there that YOU WOULD KEEP.\n\nDo NOT use empathy to MAKE THE PAST REAL, and so perpetuate it. Step\ngently aside, and let the healing be done FOR you. Keep but one thought in mind,\nand do not lose sight of it, however tempted you may be to judge the situation,\nand DETERMINE your response BY judging it. Focus your mind only on this;\n\n“I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest.\n\nI have invited Him, and He is here.\n\nI need do nothing except NOT TO INTERFERE.”",

    "content": "True Empathy\n\nTrue empathy is of Him Who knows what it is. YOU will learn HIS\ninterpretation of it, if you let Him use YOUR capacity for strength, and NOT for\nweakness.\n\nHe will NOT desert you, but be sure that YOU desert not Him. Humility\nis strength in this sense only; to recognize and ACCEPT the fact that you do NOT\nknow, is to recognize and accept the fact that He DOES know. You are not sure\nthat He will do His part, because you have NEVER YET DONE YOURS COMPLETELY. You\nwill NOT know how to respond to what you do NOT understand. Be tempted not in\nthis and yield not to the ego's triumphant use of empathy, for ITS glory. The\ntriumph of weakness is NOT what you would offer to a brother. And yet you know no\ntriumph but this. This is NOT knowledge, and the form of empathy that would bring\nit about, is so distorted that it would imprison what it would release.\n\nThe unredeemed cannot redeem. Yet they HAVE a Redeemer. Attempt to\nteach Him not. YOU are the learner; HE the Teacher. Do not confuse your role with\nHis, for this will NEVER bring peace to anyone. Offer your empathy to Him, for it\nis HIS perception and His STRENGTH that you would share. And let Him offer you\nHIS strength and HIS perception, to be shared THROUGH you.\nThe meaning of love is lost in any relationship which looks to weakness, and\nhopes to find it there. The POWER of love, which IS its meaning, lies in the\nstrength of God, which hovers over it and blesses it silently, by enveloping it\nin healing wings. LET THIS BE, and do not try to substitute YOUR “miracle” for\nthis.\n\nWe once said that, if a brother asks a foolish thing of you, to do it.\nBut be certain that this does NOT mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt\neither him or you, for what would hurt one WILL hurt the other. Foolish requests\nARE foolish, for the simple reason THAT THEY CONFLICT, because they contain an\nelement of specialness. Only the Holy Spirit recognizes foolish needs, AS WELL AS\nreal ones. And He will teach you how to meet BOTH, without losing either.\n\nYOU will be able to do this ONLY IN SECRECY. And you will think that,\nby meeting the needs of one, you do NOT jeopardize another, because you keep them\nSEPARATE, and secret from each other. This is NOT the way, for it leads not to\nlight and truth. No needs will long be left unmet, if you leave them ALL to Him\nWhose FUNCTION is to meet them. This is His function, and NOT YOURS. He will NOT\nmeet them secretly, for He would share everything you give through Him. And that",

    "content": "The Magnitude of Holiness\n\nYou still think holiness is difficult, because you cannot see how it\ncan be extended to include EVERYONE, and you HAVE learned that it MUST include\neveryone, to BE holy. Concern yourselves not with the EXTENSION of holiness, for\nthe nature of miracles you do NOT understand. Nor do you DO them. It is their\nextension, far beyond the limits you perceive, that demonstrates you did NOT do\nthem. Why should you worry how the miracle extends to all the Sonship, when you\ndo not understand the miracle itself? One ATTRIBUTE is no more difficult to\nunderstand than is the whole. If miracles ARE at all, their attributes would have\nto be miraculous, being PART of them.\n\nThere is a tendency to fragment, and then to be concerned about the\ntruth of just a little PART of the whole. And this is but a way of avoiding, or\nlooking AWAY FROM the whole, to what you think you might be better able to\nunderstand. And this is but another way in which you would still try to keep\nunderstanding TO YOURSELF. A better and FAR more helpful way to think of miracles\nis this: You do NOT understand them, either in part OR whole. Yet you have DONE\nthem. Therefore, YOUR understanding CANNOT be necessary. Yet it is still\nimpossible to accomplish what you do not understand. And so there must be\nSomething IN you that DOES understand.\n\nTo you the miracle CANNOT seem natural, because what you have done to\nhurt your minds, has made THEM so UNnatural that they do not remember what is\nnatural to them. And when you are TOLD about it, you cannot UNDERSTAND it. The\nrecognition of the part as whole, and of the whole in every part, is PERFECTLY\nnatural. For it is the way GOD thinks, and what is natural to Him, IS natural to\nyou. WHOLLY natural perception would show you instantly that order of difficulty\nin miracles is quite impossible, for it involves a contradiction of what miracles\nMEAN. And, if you could understand their MEANING, their ATTRIBUTES could hardly\ncause you perplexity.\n\nYou HAVE done miracles, but it is QUITE apparent that you have NOT\ndone them alone. You have succeeded whenever you have reached another mind, and\nJOINED with it. When two minds join as one, and share one idea equally, the first\nlink in the awareness of the Sonship as one has been made. When you have made\nthis joining, as the Holy Spirit bids you, and have OFFERED it to Him to use as\nHE knows how, His natural perception of your gift enables HIM to understand it,\nand YOU to USE His understanding on YOUR behalf. It is impossible to convince you\nof the reality of what has clearly BEEN accomplished, through your willingness,\nas long as you believe that YOU must understand it, or else IT is not real.\n\nYou think your LACK of understanding is a LOSS to you, and so you are\nunwilling to believe that what HAS happened is true. Yet can you REALLY believe\nthat all that has happened, EVEN THOUGH you do NOT understand it, HAS NOT\nHAPPENED? Yet this IS your position. You would have PERFECT faith in the Holy\nSpirit, and in the EFFECTS of His teaching, if you were not AFRAID to acknowledge\nwhat He taught you. For this acknowledgement MEANS that what has happened you do\nNOT understand, but that you are willing to ACCEPT it, BECAUSE it has happened.\nHow can faith in reality be yours, while you are bent on making it UNreal? And\nare you REALLY safer in maintaining the UNreality of what has happened, than you\nwould be in joyously accepting it FOR WHAT IT IS, and giving thanks for it?\n\nHonor the truth that has been given you, and be glad you do NOT\nunderstand it. Miracles are natural to God, and to the One Who speaks for Him.\nFor His task is to TRANSLATE the miracle into the knowledge which it REPRESENTS,\nand which IS lost to you. Let HIS understanding of the miracle be enough for you,\nand do not turn away from all the witnesses that He has given you to His reality.\nNO evidence will convince you of the truth of what you do NOT want. Yet your\nrelationship with Him IS real, and HAS been demonstrated. Regard this not with\nfear, but with rejoicing. The One you called upon IS with you. Bid Him welcome,\nand honor His witnesses, who bring you the glad tidings that He HAS come.\n\nIt IS true, JUST AS YOU FEAR, that to acknowledge Him, IS to deny ALL\nthat you think you know. But it was NEVER true. What gain is there to you in\nclinging to it, and denying the evidence for truth? For you have come too near to\ntruth to renounce it now, and you WILL yield to its compelling attraction. You\ncan delay this now, but only a little. The host of God has called to you, and you\nHAVE heard. Never again will you be wholly willing NOT to listen. This is a year\nof joy, in which your listening will increase, and peace will grow with its\nincrease.\n\nThe power of holiness AND THE WEAKNESS OF ATTACK, have BOTH been\nbrought into awareness. And this has been accomplished in minds firmly convinced\nthat holiness is weakness, and attack is power. Should not that be a sufficient\nmiracle to teach you that your Teacher is NOT of you? But remember also that,\nwhenever you have listened to HIS interpretation, the results have brought YOU\njoy. Would you PREFER the results of YOUR interpretation, considering honestly\nwhat they have been? God wills you better. Could you not look with greater\ncharity, on whom God loves with perfect love? Do not interpret AGAINST His love\nfor you. For you have many witnesses that speak of it so clearly, that only the\nblind and deaf could fail to see and hear them.\n\nThis year, determine NOT to deny what has been given you BY God, to\nuse for Him. He has Himself reminded you of Him. Awake and SHARE it, for that is\nthe only reason He has called to you. His Voice has spoken clearly, and yet you\nhave so little faith in what you heard, because you have preferred to place\nstill greater faith in the disaster YOU have made. Today, let us resolve TOGETHER\nto accept the joyful tidings that disaster is NOT real, and that reality is NOT\ndisaster. Reality is safe and sure and wholly kind to everyone and everything.\nThere is no greater love than to accept this, and be glad. For love asks only\nthat YOU BE HAPPY, and will GIVE you everything that makes for happiness.\n\nYou have never given ANY problem to the Holy Spirit He has not solved.\nNOR will you ever do so. You have never tried to solve ANYTHING yourself and been\nsuccessful. Is it not time you brought these facts TOGETHER, and made SENSE of\nthem? This is the year for the APPLICATION of the ideas that have been given you.\nFor the ideas are mighty forces, to be USED, and not held idly by. They have\nALREADY proved their power sufficiently for you to place your faith in THEM, and",

    "content": "The Reward of Teaching\n\nYou have taught well, and yet you have not learned how to ACCEPT the\ncomfort of your teaching. If you will consider WHAT you have taught, and how\nalien it is to what you THOUGHT you knew, you will be COMPELLED to recognize that\nyour Teacher came from BEYOND your thought-system, and so could look upon it\nfairly, and perceive it was untrue. And He MUST have done so from the basis of a\nvery different thought-system, and one with NOTHING IN COMMON WITH YOURS. For\ncertainly, what He has taught, and what you taught THROUGH Him, HAS nothing in\ncommon with what you taught BEFORE He came. And the results have been to bring\npeace where there was pain, and suffering has disappeared, to be replaced by joy.\n\nYou HAVE taught freedom, but you have NOT learned how to be free. We\nonce said, “By their fruits ye shall know them, and they shall know themselves.”\nFor it is certain that you judge YOURSELF according to your teaching. The ego's\nteaching produces IMMEDIATE results, because ITS decisions are immediately\nACCEPTED AS YOUR CHOICE. And this acceptance MEANS that you are willing to judge\nyourself accordingly. Cause and effect are very clear in the ego's thoughtsystem,\nbecause all your learning has been directed towards ESTABLISHING the\nrelationship between them. And would you NOT have faith in what you have so\ndiligently taught yourself to believe? But remember how much care you have\nexerted in choosing its witnesses, and in AVOIDING those who spoke for the Cause\nof truth, and ITS effects.\n\nDoes not the fact that you have NOT learned what you HAVE taught, show\nyou that you do NOT perceive the Sonship as one? And does it not also show you\nthat you do not regard YOURSELF as one? For it is impossible to teach\nsuccessfully, WHOLLY without conviction, and it is equally impossible that\nconviction be OUTSIDE you. You could never have taught freedom, unless you DID\nbelieve in it. And it MUST be that what you taught CAME FROM YOURSELF.\nAnd yet, this self you clearly DO NOT KNOW, and do not recognize EVEN THOUGH IT\nFUNCTIONS. What functions, must be THERE. And it is ONLY if you deny WHAT IT HAS\nDONE, that you could possibly deny its presence.\n\nThis is a course in how to KNOW yourself. You have TAUGHT what you\nare, but have NOT let what you are, teach YOU. You have been VERY careful to\navoid the obvious, and NOT to see the REAL cause and effect relationship that is\nPERFECTLY apparent. Yet, within you, is EVERYTHING you taught. What can it be,\nthat has NOT learned it? It must be this that is REALLY outside yourself, NOT by\nyour own projection, BUT IN TRUTH. And it is this, that you have TAKEN IN, that\nis NOT you. What YOU accept into your minds, does not REALLY change them.\nIllusions are but beliefs in WHAT IS NOT THERE. And the seeming conflict between\ntruth and illusion can ONLY be resolved by SEPARATING YOURSELF FROM THE ILLUSION,\nand NOT from truth.\n\nYour teaching has already DONE this, for the Holy Spirit is PART OF\nYOU. Created by God, He left neither God nor His creation. He is both God and\nyou, as you are God and Him together. For God's answer to the separation added\nmore to you than you tried to TAKE AWAY. He protected both your creations AND you\ntogether, keeping one with you what you would EXCLUDE. And they will TAKE THE\nPLACE of what YOU took in, to replace THEM. They are QUITE real, and part of the\nself you do not know. And they communicate to you through the Holy Spirit, and\ntheir power and gratitude to you for THEIR creation, they offer gladly to your\nteaching of your self, who is their home.\n\nYou who are host to God, are also host to THEM. For nothing real has\never left the mind of its Creator. And what is NOT real was NEVER there. You are\nNOT two selves in conflict. What is BEYOND GOD? If you who hold Him, and whom He\nholds, ARE the universe, all else must be OUTSIDE, where NOTHING is.\nYOU have taught this, and from far off in the universe, yet NOT beyond yourself,\nthe witnesses to your teaching have gathered to help you learn. Their gratitude\nhas joined with yours and God's, to strengthen your faith in what you taught. FOR\nWHAT YOU TAUGHT IS TRUE. Alone, you stand OUTSIDE your teaching and APART from\nit. But WITH them, you MUST learn that you but taught YOURSELF, and LEARNED from\nthe conviction you SHARED with them.\n\nThis year you will begin to learn, and make learning COMMENSURATE with\nteaching. You have CHOSEN this, by your own willingness to teach. Though you\nseemed to suffer for it, the joy of teaching will yet be yours. For the joy of\nteaching is IN THE LEARNER, who offers it to the teacher in gratitude, and shares\nit WITH him. As you learn, your gratitude to your SELF, Who teaches you what He\nIS, will grow and help you honor Him. And you will learn His power and strength\nand purity, and love Him as His Father does. His Kingdom has no limits and no\nend, and there is nothing in Him that is not perfect and eternal. All this is\nYOU, and nothing OUTSIDE of this IS you. To your most Holy Self all praise is\ndue, for what you are, and for what He is Who created you AS you are.\n\nSooner or later must everyone bridge the gap which he imagines exists\nbetween his selves. Each one builds this bridge, which CARRIES HIM ACROSS the\ngap, as soon as he is willing to expend some little effort on behalf of bridging\nit. His little efforts are powerfully supplemented by the strength of Heaven, and\nby the united will of all who make Heaven what it is, being joined within it.

    "content": "Illusion and Reality of Love\n\nBe not afraid to look upon the special hate relationship, for freedom\nlies here. It would be impossible NOT to know the meaning of love, EXCEPT FOR\nTHIS. For the special love relationship, IN WHICH THE MEANING OF LOVE IS LOST, is\nundertaken SOLELY to OFFSET this, but NOT to LET IT GO. Your salvation will rise\nclearly before your open eyes, as you look on this. YOU CANNOT LIMIT HATE. The\nspecial love relationship will NOT offset it, but will merely DRIVE IT\nUNDERGROUND, and out of sight. It is essential to bring it INTO sight, and to\nmake NO attempt to hide it. For it is the attempt to BALANCE hate with love that\nmakes love meaningless to you.\n\nThe extent of the split that lies in this you do NOT realize. And\nuntil you do, the split will remain unrecognized, AND THEREFORE UNHEALED. The\nsymbols of hate against the symbols of love play out a conflict that does not\nexist. For symbols stand for something else, and the SYMBOL of love IS without\nmeaning, if love is everything. You will go through this last undoing quite\nunharmed, and will emerge AS YOURSELF. This is the last step in the readiness for\nGod. Be not unwilling now, you are too near, and you WILL cross the bridge in\nperfect safety, translated quietly from war to peace. For the ILLUSION of love\nwill NEVER satisfy you. But its REALITY, which awaits you on the other side, WILL\ngive you everything.\n\nThe special love relationship is an attempt to limit the destructive\nEFFECTS of hate, by finding a haven in the storm of guilt. It makes NO attempt to\nRISE ABOVE the storm, into the sunlight. On the contrary, it EMPHASIZES guilt\nOUTSIDE the haven, by attempting to build barricades AGAINST it, and keep WITHIN\nthem. The special love relationship is NOT perceived as of value IN ITSELF, but\nas a place of safety, from which hatred is split off, and KEPT APART. The special\nlove partner is acceptable ONLY as long as he serves this purpose. Hatred can\nenter, and, indeed, is WELCOME in some ASPECTS of the relationship, but it is\nstill held together by the illusion of love. If the illusion goes, the relationship is broken or becomes unsatisfying, on the\ngrounds of DISillusionment.\n\nLOVE IS NOT AN ILLUSION. It is a FACT. Where DISillusionment is\npossible, there was NOT love, but HATE. For hate IS an illusion, and what can\nchange was NEVER love. It is certain that those who select certain ones as\npartners in ANY aspect of living, and use them for ANY purpose which they would\nNOT share with others, are trying to LIVE WITH guilt rather than DIE OF it. This\nis the choice they see. And love to them is only AN ESCAPE FROM DEATH. They seek\nit desperately, NOT in the peace in which it would gladly come quietly TO them.\nAnd when they find the fear of death is still upon them, the “love” relationship\nloses the illusion that it IS what it is NOT. For, when the barricades against it\nare broken, fear rushes in and hatred triumphs.\n\nThere are no triumphs of love. Only hate is concerned with the triumph\nof love at all. The ILLUSION of love CAN triumph over the illusion of hate, but\nALWAYS at the price of MAKING BOTH ILLUSIONS. As long as the illusion of hatred\nlasts, so long WILL love be an illusion to you. And then the ONLY choice that\nremains possible, is which illusion you PREFER. There IS no conflict in the\nchoice between truth and illusion. Seen in these terms, NO-ONE would hesitate.\nBut conflict enters the instant the choice seems to be one BETWEEN ILLUSIONS, for\nthis choice does NOT matter. Where one choice IS as dangerous as the other, the\ndecision MUST be one of despair.\n\nYour task is NOT to seek for love, but merely to seek and FIND all of\nthe barriers WITHIN YOURSELF that you have built AGAINST it. It is NOT necessary\nto seek for what is true, but it IS necessary to seek for what is FALSE. Every\nillusion is one of fear, WHATEVER form it takes.\nAnd the attempt to escape from one illusion INTO ANOTHER, MUST fail. If you seek\nlove OUTSIDE yourself, you can be certain that you perceive hatred within, AND\nARE AFRAID OF IT. Yet peace will never come from the ILLUSION of love, but ONLY\nfrom its reality.\n\nRecognize this, for it is true, and truth MUST be recognized, if it is\nto be distinguished from illusion: the special love relationship is an attempt TO\nBRING LOVE INTO SEPARATION. And, as such, it is nothing more than an attempt to\nbring love into fear, and MAKE IT REAL IN FEAR. In fundamental violation of\nlove's one condition, the special love relationship would thus ACCOMPLISH THE\nIMPOSSIBLE. How but in illusion COULD this be done? It is essential that we look\nVERY closely at exactly what it is you THINK you can do, to solve a dilemma which\nseems very real to you, but which does not exist. You have come very close to\ntruth. And only this stands between you and the bridge that leads you into it.\nHeaven waits silently, and your creations are holding out their hands to help you\ncross, and welcome them.\n\nFOR IT IS THEY YOU SEEK. You seek but for your own COMPLETION, and it\nis they who render you complete. The special love relationship is but a shabby\nsubstitute for what makes you whole IN TRUTH, NOT in illusion. Your relationship\nwith them IS without guilt, and THIS enables you to look on all your brothers\nwith gratitude, because your creations were created in union WITH them.\nAcceptance of your creations IS the acceptance of the oneness of creation,\nwithout which you would never BE complete. No specialness can offer you what God\nhas given, and what YOU are joined WITH Him in giving. Across the bridge IS your\ncompletion, for you will be WHOLLY in God, willing for NOTHING special, but only\nto be wholly like unto Him, completing Him by your completion.\n\nFear not to cross to the abode of peace and perfect holiness. Only\nthere is the completion of God and of His Son established forever. Seek not for\nthis in the bleak world of illusion, where nothing is certain, and where\neverything fails to satisfy. And, in the Name of God, be wholly willing to\nabandon ALL illusion. In any relationship in which you are wholly willing to\naccept completion, and ONLY this, there is God completed, and His Son WITH Him.\nThe bridge that leads to union IN YOURSELF, MUST lead to knowledge, for it was\nbuilt with God beside you. And will lead you straight to Him, where YOUR\ncompletion rests, WHOLLY compatible with His.\n\nEvery illusion which you accept into your mind, BY JUDGING IT TO BE\nATTAINABLE, removes your own sense of completion, and thus denies the Wholeness\nof your Father. Every fantasy, be it of love OR hate, DEPRIVES you of knowledge.\nFor fantasies ARE the veil behind which truth is hidden. To lift the veil, which\nseems so dark and heavy, it is only needful to VALUE truth beyond ALL fantasy,\nand to be entirely UNwilling to settle for illusion IN PLACE of truth. Would you\nnot go THROUGH fear to Love? For such the journey SEEMS to be. Love calls, though\nhate would bid you stay.\n\nHear not the call of hate, and see no fantasies. For your completion\nlies in truth, and NOWHERE ELSE. See in the call of hate, and in every fantasy\nthat rises to delay you, but the call for help, that rises ceaselessly from you\nto your Creator. Would He not answer you; whose completion is His? He loves you,\nwholly WITHOUT illusion, as you must love. For love IS wholly without illusion,\nand therefore wholly WITHOUT FEAR. Whom God remembers, MUST be whole. And God has\nNEVER forgotten what makes HIM whole. In YOUR completion lies the memory of HIS\nwholeness, and His gratitude to you for His completion.\n\nIn His link with you lie both His INABILITY to forget, and YOUR\nability to remember. In Him are joined your WILLINGNESS to love, and all the love\nof God, Who forgot you not. Your Father can no more forget the truth in you, than\nyou can fail to remember it. The Holy Spirit is the bridge to Him, made from your\nwillingness to UNITE with Him, and created by His joy, in union WITH you. The\njourney that SEEMED to be endless is ALMOST complete, for what IS endless is very\nnear. YOU HAVE ALMOST RECOGNIZED IT. Turn with me firmly away from ALL illusion\nNOW, and let nothing stand in the way of truth. We will take the last foolish\njourney AWAY FROM truth together. And then TOGETHER we go straight to God, in\njoyous answer to His call for His completion.\n\nIf special relationships of ANY kind would HINDER God's completion,\nCAN they have any value TO YOU? What would interfere with God, MUST interfere\nwith you. Only in time does interference in God's completion SEEM to be possible.\nThe bridge that He would carry you across, lifts you FROM time into eternity.\nWaken from time, and answer fearlessly the call of Him Who gave eternity to you\nin your creation. On this side of the bridge to timelessness, you understand\nnothing. But, as you step lightly across it, upheld BY Timelessness, you are\ndirected straight to the heart of knowledge. At Its center, and ONLY there, you\nare safe forever, BECAUSE YOU ARE COMPLETE FOREVER. There is no veil the love of\nGod in us together CANNOT lift. The way to Truth is open. Follow it with me.",

    "content": "Specialness and Guilt\n\nIn looking at the special relationship, it is necessary first to\nrealize that it involves a great amount of pain. Anxiety, despair, guilt, and\nattack all enter into it, BROKEN INTO by periods in which they SEEM to be gone.\nAll these must be understood for what they ARE. Whatever form they take, they are\nalways an attack on the self, TO MAKE THE OTHER GUILTY.\nWe have spoken of this before, but there are some aspects of what is REALLY being\nattempted, that we have not touched on. Very simply, the attempt to make guilty\nis ALWAYS directed against God. For the ego would have you see Him, AND HIM\nALONE, as guilty, leaving the Sonship OPEN to attack, and unprotected against it.\n\nThe special love relationship is the ego's chief weapon for keeping\nyou from Heaven. It does not APPEAR to be a weapon, but if you consider HOW you\nVALUE it, and why, you will realize what it MUST be. The special love\nrelationship is the ego's most boasted gift, and the one that has the most appeal\nto those unwilling to relinquish guilt. The “dynamics” of the ego are clearest\nhere, for, counting on the attraction of this offering, the fantasies which\ncenter around this, are often quite open. Here, they are usually judged to be\nquite acceptable, and even NATURAL. No-one considers it bizarre to love and hate\ntogether, and even those who believe that hate is “sin,” merely feel guilty, but\ndo NOT correct it.\n\nThis IS the “natural” condition of the separation. And those who learn\nthat it is NOT natural at all, seem to be the UNnatural ones. For this world IS\nthe opposite of Heaven, having been made to BE its opposite. And EVERYTHING here\ntakes a direction EXACTLY opposite to what is true. In Heaven, where the meaning\nof love is known, love is the same as UNION. Here, where the ILLUSION of love is\naccepted IN ITS PLACE, love is perceived as separation and EXCLUSION.\n\nIt is in the special relationship, born of the hidden wish for special\nlove from God, that the ego's hatred triumphs. For the special relationship is\nTHE RENUNCIATION OF THE LOVE OF GOD, and the attempt to secure for the self the\nspecialness that He denied. And it is essential\nto the preservation of the ego, that you believe this specialness is NOT hell,\nbut HEAVEN. For the ego would never have you see that the separation can ONLY BE\nLOSS, being the one condition in which Heaven CANNOT be.\n\nTo everyone, Heaven is completion. There CAN be no disagreement on\nthis, because both the ego AND the Holy Spirit accept it. They are, however, in\ncomplete DISagreement on what completion IS, and HOW it is accomplished. The Holy\nSpirit knows that self completion lies first in union, and then in the EXTENSION\nof union. To the ego, completion lies in triumph, and in the extension of the\n“victory,” even to the final triumph over God. In THIS it sees the ultimate\nFREEDOM of the self, for nothing would remain to interfere with IT. And this IS\nits idea of Heaven. From this it follows that union, which is a condition in\nwhich the EGO cannot interfere, MUST BE HELL.\n\nThe special relationship is a strange and unnatural ego device for\njoining hell and Heaven, and making them indistinguishable. And the attempt to\nfind the imagined “best” of BOTH worlds, has merely led to FANTASIES of both, and\nto the inability to perceive either one AS IT IS. The special relationship is the\ntriumph of this confusion. It is a kind of union from which UNION IS EXCLUDED,\nand the BASIS for the ATTEMPT at union RESTS on exclusion. What better example\ncould there be of the ego's maxim, “Seek, and do NOT find?”\n\nMost curious of all, is the concept of the self, which the ego fosters\nin the special relationship. This “self” SEEKS the relationship, to MAKE ITSELF\nCOMPLETE. Yet, when it FINDS the special relationship in which it thinks it can\nACCOMPLISH this, IT GIVES ITSELF AWAY, and tries to TRADE itself for the self of\nanother. This is NOT union, for there is\nNO increase and NO extension. Each partner tries to sacrifice the self he does\nNOT want, for one he thinks he would PREFER. He feels guilty for the “sin” of\nTAKING, and of giving nothing of value in return. For how much value CAN he place\nupon a self that he would GIVE AWAY, to get a BETTER one?\n\nThe “better” self the ego seeks is ALWAYS one that is MORE special.\nAnd whoever SEEMS to possess a special self is “loved,” FOR WHAT CAN BE TAKEN\nFROM HIM. Where both partners see this special self IN EACH OTHER, the EGO sees\n“a union made in Heaven.” For NEITHER will recognize that HE HAS ASKED FOR HELL,\nand so he will NOT interfere with the ego's ILLUSION of Heaven, which it offered\nhim TO INTERFERE WITH HEAVEN. Yet if ALL illusions are of fear, and they CAN be\nof nothing else, the illusion of Heaven is nothing more than an ATTRACTIVE form\nof fear, in which the guilt is buried deep, and rises in the form of “love.”\n\nThe appeal of hell lies ONLY in the terrible attraction of guilt,\nwhich the ego holds out to those who place their faith in littleness. The\nconviction of littleness lies in EVERY special relationship, for only the\ndeprived COULD value specialness. The “DEMAND” for specialness, and the\nperception of the GIVING of specialness AS AN ACT OF LOVE, would MAKE LOVE\nHATEFUL. And the REAL purpose of the special relationship, in strict accordance\nwith the ego's goals, is to DESTROY reality and SUBSTITUTE ILLUSION. For the ego\nis ITSELF an illusion, and ONLY illusions can BE the witnesses to its reality.\n\nIf you perceived the special relationship as a triumph over God, WOULD\nYOU WANT IT? Let us not think of its fearful nature, nor of the guilt it MUST\nentail, nor of the sadness and the loneliness. For these are only ATTRIBUTES of\nthe whole religion of the separation, and the total\ncontext in which it is thought to occur. The central theme in its litany to\nsacrifice is that GOD MUST DIE SO YOU CAN LIVE. And it is this theme that is\nacted out in the special relationship. Through the death of YOUR self, you think\nyou can ATTACK another self, and snatch it FROM the other, to REPLACE the self\nthat you despised. And you despise it BECAUSE YOU DO NOT THINK IT OFFERS YOU THE\nSPECIALNESS THAT YOU DEMAND. And, HATING it, YOU have made it little and\nunworthy, BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID OF IT.\n\nHow can you grant unlimited power to what you think you have ATTACKED?\nFor so fearful has the truth become that, UNLESS it is weak, and little, and\nunworthy of value, you would not dare to look upon it. You think it safer to\nendow the little self which YOU have made, with power you WRESTED FROM truth,\ntriumphing over it, and leaving IT helpless. See how EXACTLY is this ritual\nenacted in the special relationship. An altar is erected IN BETWEEN two separate\npeople, on which each seeks to kill his self, and on his body, raise another self\nthat TAKES HIS POWER FROM ITS DEATH.\n\nOver and over and over, this ritual is enacted. And it is NEVER\ncompleted, nor ever will BE completed. For the RITUAL of completion CANNOT\ncomplete, and life arises not from death, nor Heaven from hell. Whenever ANY form\nof special relationship tempts you to seek for love in ritual, remember love is\nCONTENT, and NOT form of ANY kind. The special relationship is a RITUAL OF FORM,\naimed at the raising of the form to take the place of God, at the EXPENSE of\ncontent. There IS no meaning in the form, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE. The special\nrelationship MUST be recognized for what it is; a senseless ritual, in which\nstrength is extracted from the\ndeath of God, and invested in His killer, as the sign that form has triumphed\nover content, and love has LOST its meaning.\n\nWould you WANT this to be possible, even APART from its evident\nimpossibility? For, if it WERE possible, you would have made YOURSELF helpless.\nGod is not angry. He merely could not let this happen. You can NOT change His\nMind. No rituals that you have set up, in which the dance of death delights you,\ncan bring death to the Eternal. Nor can your chosen substitute for the Wholeness\nof God, have ANY influence at all upon It. See in the special relationship\nnothing more than a meaningless attempt to raise other gods before Him, and, by\nworshipping them, to obscure THEIR tininess, AND HIS GREATNESS.\n\nIn the name of YOUR completion, you do not WANT this. And every idol\nthat you raise to place BEFORE Him, stands before YOU, in place of what YOU are.\nSalvation lies in the simple fact that illusions are NOT fearful, BECAUSE THEY\nARE NOT TRUE. And they but SEEM to be fearful to the extent to which you fail to\nrecognize them FOR WHAT THEY ARE. And you WILL fail to do this, to the extent to\nwhich you WANT them to be true. And, to the same extent, you are DENYING truth,\nand so are making YOURSELF unable to make the simple choice between truth and\nillusion, fantasy and God.\n\nRemember this, and you will have no difficulty in perceiving the\ndecision as just what it IS, and nothing more. The core of the separation\ndelusion lies simply in the fantasy DESTRUCTION of love's meaning. And, unless\nits meaning is RESTORED to you, you CANNOT know yourself, who SHARE its meaning.\nSeparation is only the decision NOT to know yourself. Its whole thought-system is\na carefully-contrived learning experience, designed to lead AWAY from truth, and\ninto fantasy.\nYet, for every learning that would hurt you, God offers you correction, and\nCOMPLETE escape from ALL its consequences.\n\nThe decision whether or not to listen to this course and follow it, is\nbut the choice between truth and illusion. For here IS truth, SEPARATED from\nillusion, and NOT confused with it at all. How simple does this choice become\nwhen it is perceived as only what it is. For ONLY fantasies made confusion in\nchoosing possible, and they are totally UNreal. This year is thus the time to\nmake the EASIEST decision that ever confronted you, and also the ONLY one. You",

    "content": "The Bridge to the Real World\n\nThe search for the special relationship is the sign that you equate\nyour self with the ego, and NOT with God. For the special relationship has value\nONLY to the ego. To IT, UNLESS a relationship HAS special value, IT HAS NO\nMEANING. And it perceives ALL love as special. Yet, this CANNOT be natural, for\nit is UNlike the relationship of God and His Son, and ALL relationships that are\nunlike this One, MUST be unnatural. For God created love as He would have it be,\nand GAVE it as it IS. Love HAS no meaning except as its Creator defined it, by\nHis Will. It is impossible to define it otherwise, and UNDERSTAND it.\n\nLOVE IS FREEDOM. To look for it by placing yourself in BONDAGE, is to\nSEPARATE yourself from it. For the love of God, no longer seek for union in\nseparation, nor for freedom in bondage! As you release, so will you BE released.\nFORGET THIS NOT, or love will be unable to find you, and comfort you. There is a\nway in which the Holy Spirit asks YOUR help, if you would have His. The holy\ninstant is His most helpful tool in protecting you from the attraction of guilt,\nthe REAL lure in the special relationship. You do NOT recognize that this IS its\nREAL appeal, for the ego has taught you that FREEDOM lies in it.\n\nYet, the closer you look at the special relationship, the more\napparent it becomes that it MUST foster guilt, and therefore must IMPRISON. The\nspecial relationship is totally without meaning WITHOUT A BODY. And, if you VALUE\nit, you must also VALUE THE BODY. And what you value, you WILL keep. The special\nrelationship is a device for limiting YOUR self to a body, and for limiting your\nperception of others to THEIRS. The Great Rays would establish the total LACK of\nvalue of the special relationship, IF THEY WERE SEEN. For, in seeing THEM, the\nbody WOULD disappear, BECAUSE ITS VALUE WOULD BE LOST. And so your whole\nINVESTMENT in seeing it would be WITHDRAWN from it.\n\nYOU SEE THE WORLD YOU VALUE. On this side of the bridge, you see\nthe world of separate bodies, seeking to join each other in SEPARATE UNIONS, and\nto become one BY LOSING. When two INDIVIDUALS seek to become ONE, they are trying\nto DECREASE their magnitude. Each would DENY his power, for the SEPARATE union\nEXCLUDES THE UNIVERSE. Far more is LEFT OUTSIDE than would be taken in. For God\nis left WITHOUT, and NOTHING taken in. If one such union were made IN PERFECT\nFAITH, the universe WOULD enter into it. Yet the special relationship which the\nEGO seeks, does NOT include even ONE whole individual. For the ego WANTS but part\nof him, and sees ONLY this part, and nothing else.\n\nAcross the bridge, it is so different! For a time the body is still\nseen, but NOT exclusively, as it is seen here. For the little spark that holds\nthe Great Rays within it, is ALSO visible, and this spark cannot be limited long\nto littleness. Once you have crossed the bridge, the VALUE of the body is so\ndiminished in YOUR sight, that you will see no need at all to MAGNIFY it. For you\nwill realize that the ONLY value that the body has, is to enable you to bring\nyour brothers TO the bridge WITH you. And to be RELEASED TOGETHER there.\n\nThe bridge itself is nothing more than a transition in your\nPERSPECTIVE of reality. On this side, everything you see is grossly distorted,\nand COMPLETELY out of perspective. What IS little and insignificant is magnified,\nand what is strong and powerful, cut down to littleness. In the transition, there\nis a period of confusion, in which a sense of actual disorientation seems to\noccur. But fear it not, for it means nothing more than that you have been willing\nto LET GO your hold on the distorted frame of reference, that SEEMED to hold your\nworld together. This frame of reference is BUILT around the special relationship.\nWithout THIS illusion, there can BE no meaning you would still seek here.\n\nFear not that you will be abruptly lifted up, and hurled into reality.\nTime is kind, and, if you use it FOR reality, it will keep gentle pace with you,\nin your transition. The urgency is only in dislodging\nyour minds from their FIXED POSITION here. This will not leave you homeless, and\nWITHOUT a frame of reference. The period of disorientation, which precedes the\nactual transition, is far shorter than the time it took to fix your minds so\nfirmly on illusions. Delay will hurt you now MORE THAN BEFORE, ONLY because you\nrealize it IS delay, and that escape from pain IS REALLY POSSIBLE. Find hope and\ncomfort, rather than despair, in this:\n\nYou could no longer find even the ILLUSION of love in ANY special\nrelationship here. For you are no longer WHOLLY insane, and you WOULD recognize\nthe guilt of SELF-betrayal FOR WHAT IT IS. Nothing you seek to strengthen, in the\nspecial relationship, is REALLY part of you. And you cannot keep PART of the\nthought-system that taught you it WAS real, and understand the Thought that\nREALLY knows what you are. You HAVE allowed the Thought of your reality to enter\nyour minds, and, because YOU invited it, it WILL abide with you. Your love for it\nwill not allow you to betray yourself, and you COULD not enter into a\nrelationship WHERE IT COULD NOT GO WITH YOU, for you would NOT be APART from it.\n\nBe glad you have escaped the mockery of salvation that the ego offered\nyou, and look not back with longing on the travesty it made of your\nrelationships. Now, no-one need suffer, for you have come too far to yield to the\nillusion of the beauty and holiness of guilt. Only the wholly insane could look\non death and suffering, sickness and despair, and see it thus. What guilt has\nwrought is ugly, fearful, and very dangerous. See no illusion of truth and beauty\nthere. And be you thankful that there IS a place where truth and beauty wait for\nyou.\n\nGo on to meet them gladly, and learn how much awaits you, for the\nsimple willingness to give up nothing, BECAUSE it is nothing. The new perspective\nyou will gain, from crossing over, will be the understanding of WHERE HEAVEN IS.\nFrom HERE, it seems to be outside, and ACROSS the bridge. But, as you cross to\nJOIN it, IT will JOIN WITH YOU, and BECOME ONE with you. And you will think, in\nglad astonishment, that for all this, YOU GAVE UP NOTHING! The joy of Heaven, which HAS no limit, is INCREASED with each light\nthat returns, to take its rightful place within it. Wait no longer, for the Love\nof God and YOU. And may the holy instant speed you on the way, as it will surely\ndo, if you but LET it come to you.\n\nThe Holy Spirit asks only this little help of you. Whenever your\nthoughts wander to a special relationship which still ATTRACTS you, enter with\nHim into a holy instant, and there, LET HIM RELEASE YOU. He needs only your\nwillingness to SHARE His perspective, to give it to you completely. And your\nwillingness need not be complete, BECAUSE HIS IS PERFECT. It is His task to atone\nfor your UNwillingness by His perfect faith. And it is HIS faith you share with\nHim there. Out of YOUR recognition of your UNwillingness for your release, His\nPERFECT willingness is GIVEN you. Call upon Him, for Heaven is at His call. And\nLET Him call on Heaven FOR you.",

    "content": "The End of Illusions\n\nIt is impossible to let the past go, WITHOUT relinquishing the special\nrelationship. For the special relationship is an attempt to RE-ENACT the past,\nAND CHANGE IT. Imagined slights, remembered pain, past disappointments, perceived\ninjustices and deprivations, all enter into the special relationship, which\nbecomes a way in which you seek to restore your wounded SELF-esteem. What basis\nwould you have for choosing a special partner, WITHOUT the past? EVERY such\nchoice is made because of something “evil” in the past, TO WHICH YOU CLING, and\nfor which must SOMEONE ELSE “atone.”\n\nThe special relationship TAKES VENGEANCE ON THE PAST. By seeking to\nremove suffering IN THE PAST, it OVERLOOKS the present, in its preoccupation with\nthe past, and its TOTAL COMMITMENT to it. NO SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP IS EXPERIENCED\nIN THE PRESENT. Shades of the past envelop it, and make it what it is. It HAS no\nmeaning in the present, and, if it means nothing NOW, it cannot have any REAL\nmeaning at all. How can you change the past, EXCEPT in fantasy? And who can give\nyou what you think THE PAST deprived you of? The past is nothing. Do not seek to\nlay the blame for deprivation on it, for the past IS GONE.\n\nYou cannot REALLY not let go what has ALREADY gone. It MUST be,\ntherefore, that YOU are maintaining the illusion that it has NOT gone, because\nyou think it serves some purpose that you WANT FULFILLED. And it must also be\nthat this purpose COULD NOT BE FULFILLED IN THE PRESENT, but ONLY in the past. Do\nnot underestimate the intensity of the ego's drive for vengeance on the past. It\nis COMPLETELY savage, and COMPLETELY insane. For the ego remembers everything\nthat YOU have done that offended it, and seeks retribution OF YOU. The fantasies\nit brings to the special relationships it chooses, in which to act out its hate,\nare fantasies of YOUR destruction.\n\nFor the ego holds the past AGAINST YOU, and, in your ESCAPE from\nit, it sees ITSELF deprived of the vengeance it believes that you so justly\nmerit. Yet, without your ALLIANCE in your own destruction, the ego could not hold\nyou to the past. In the special relationship, YOU ARE ALLOWING YOUR DESTRUCTION\nTO BE. That this is insane, is obvious. But what is LESS obvious to you, is that\nthe PRESENT is useless to you, while you pursue the ego's goal, as its ally. The\npast is gone; seek not to preserve it in the special relationship, which binds\nyou to it, and would teach you that SALVATION is past, and that you must RETURN\nto the past, to FIND salvation. There is NO fantasy that does not contain the\ndream of retribution for the past. Would you ACT OUT the dream, or let it go?\n\nIn the special relationship, it does not SEEM to be an acting out of\nvengeance that you seek. And, even when the hatred and the savagery break briefly\nthrough into awareness, the illusion of love is not profoundly shaken. But the\none thing that the ego NEVER allows to reach awareness, is that the special\nrelationship is the acting out of VENGEANCE ON YOURSELF. Yet what else COULD it\nbe? In seeking the special relationship, you look not for glory IN YOURSELF. You\nhave DENIED that it is there. And the relationship becomes your SUBSTITUTE for\nit. And vengeance becomes YOUR substitute for Atonement, and ESCAPE from\nvengeance becomes your LOSS.\n\nAgainst the ego's insane notion of salvation, the Holy Spirit gently\nlays the holy instant. We said before that the Holy Spirit must teach through\ncomparisons, and uses opposites to point to truth. The holy instant is the\nOPPOSITE of the ego's fixed belief in salvation through vengeance for the past.\nIn the holy instant, it is ACCEPTED that the past is gone, and WITH its passing,\nthe drive for vengeance HAS BEEN uprooted, and has disappeared. The stillness and\nthe peace of NOW, enfold you in perfect gentleness. Everything is gone, EXCEPT\nTHE TRUTH.\n\nFor a time, you may attempt to bring illusions INTO the holy instant,\nto hinder your full awareness of the COMPLETE DIFFERENCE, in ALL respects,\nbetween your EXPERIENCE of truth and illusion. But you will not\nattempt this long. In the holy instant, the power of the Holy Spirit WILL\nprevail, BECAUSE YOU JOINED HIM. The illusions you bring with you, will weaken\nthe EXPERIENCE of Him for a while, and will prevent you from KEEPING the\nexperience in your mind. Yet the holy instant IS eternal, and your illusions of\ntime will NOT prevent the timeless from being what it is, nor you from\nEXPERIENCING it as it is.\n\nWhat God has given you is truly given. AND WILL BE TRULY RECEIVED. For\nGod's gifts HAVE no reality, APART from your receiving them. YOUR receiving\ncompletes HIS giving. You will receive, BECAUSE it is His Will to give. He gave\nthe holy instant, to be given you. And it is impossible that you receive it not,\nBECAUSE He gave it. When He willed that His Son be free, His Son WAS free. In the\nholy instant is His reminder that His Son will ALWAYS be EXACTLY as he was\ncreated. And EVERYTHING the Holy Spirit teaches you, is to remind you that you\nHAVE received what God has given you.\n\nThere is nothing you CAN hold against reality. All that must be\nforgiven are the ILLUSIONS you have held against your brothers. Their reality HAS\nno past, and ONLY illusions can BE forgiven. God holds nothing against ANYONE,\nfor He is INCAPABLE of illusions of ANY kind. Release your brothers from the\nslavery of THEIR illusions, by forgiving them for the illusions which YOU\nperceive in them. Thus will you learn that YOU have been forgiven, for it is YOU\nwho offered THEM illusions. In the holy instant, this is done for you IN TIME, to\nbring to you the true condition of Heaven.\n\nRemember that you ALWAYS choose between truth and illusion, between\nthe REAL Atonement that would heal, and the ego's “atonement,” that would\ndestroy. The power of God, and all His Love, without limit, will support you, as\nyou seek only your place in the plan of Atonement arising from His Love. Be an\nally of God, and NOT the ego, in seeking how Atonement can come to you. His help\nsuffices, for His Messenger understands\nhow to restore the Kingdom TO you, and to place ALL your investment in salvation\nin your relationship with Him.\n\nSeek and FIND His message in the holy instant, where ALL illusions are\nforgiven. From here the miracle extends to bless everyone, and to resolve ALL\nproblems; be they perceived as great or small, possible or impossible. There is\nNOTHING that will not give place to Him, and to His Majesty. To join in close\nrelationship with Him, is to accept relationships AS REAL. And, through THEIR\nreality, give over ALL illusions, for the reality of your relationship with God.\nPraise be to your relationship with Him, and to no other. The truth lies here,\nAND NOWHERE ELSE. You choose this, or NOTHING.\n\nForgive us our illusions, Father, and help us to accept our true\nrelationship with You, in which there are NO illusions, and where none can ever\nenter. Our holiness is YOURS. What can there be in us that NEEDS forgiveness,\nwhen YOURS is perfect? The sleep of forgetfullness is only the unwillingness to\nremember YOUR forgiveness and Your Love. Let us not wander into temptation, for\nthe temptation of the Son of God is NOT Your Will. And let us receive ONLY what\nYOU have given, and accept but this into the minds which You created, and which\nYou love. Amen.",

    "content": "The Forgiven World\n\nCan you imagine how beautiful those you forgive will look to you? In\nno fantasy have you ever seen anything so lovely. Nothing you see here, sleeping\nor waking, comes near to such loveliness, and nothing will you value like unto\nthis, nor hold so dear. Nothing that you remember, that made your heart seem to\nsing with joy, has ever brought you even a little part of the happiness this\nsight will bring you. FOR YOU WILL SEE THE SON OF GOD. You will behold the beauty\nthat the Holy Spirit loves to look upon, and that He thanks the Father for. He\nwas created to see this FOR YOU, until you learned to see it for yourself. And\nall His teaching leads to seeing it and giving thanks with Him.\n\nThis loveliness is NOT a fantasy. It is the real world, bright, and\nclean and new, with everything sparkling under the open sun. Nothing is hidden\nhere, for everything has BEEN forgiven, and there ARE no fantasies to hide the\ntruth. The bridge between that world and this is SO little and SO easy to cross\nthat you could not believe it is the meeting-place of worlds so different. Yet\nthis little bridge is the strongest thing that touches on this world at all. This\nlittle step, so small it has escaped your notice, is a stride through time into\neternity, and beyond all ugliness, into beauty that will enchant you, and will\nnever cease to cause you wonderment at its perfection.\n\nThis step, the smallest ever taken by anything, is still the greatest\naccomplishment of all, in God's plan of Atonement. All else is learned, but THIS\nis GIVEN, complete and wholly perfect. No-one but Him Who PLANNED salvation could\ncomplete it thus. The real world, in its loveliness, YOU learn to reach.\nFantasies are all undone, no-one and nothing remains still bound by them, and, by\nYOUR OWN forgiveness, you are FREE TO\nSEE. And WHAT you see is only what YOU HAVE MADE, with the blessing of your\nforgiveness on it. And, with this final blessing of God's Son UPON HIMSELF, the\nREAL perception, born of the new perspective he has learned, has served its\npurpose.\n\nThe stars will disappear in light, and the sun, which opened up the\nworld to beauty, will vanish. Perception will be meaningless, when it has been\nperfected. For everything that has been used for learning, will have no function.\nNothing will ever change; no shifts nor shadings, no differences, no variations\nthat made perception possible, will occur. The perception of the real world will\nbe so short, that you will barely have time to thank God for it. For God will\ntake the last step swiftly, when you have reached the real world, and have been\nmade ready for Him.\n\nThe real world is attained simply by the COMPLETE forgiveness of the\nold; the world you see WITHOUT forgiveness. The Great Transformer of perception\nwill undertake WITH you the careful searching of the mind that MADE this world,\nand uncover TO YOU the SEEMING reasons for your making it. In the light of the\nREAL reason that He brings, as you follow Him, He will SHOW you that there is NO\nreason here at all. Each spot HIS reason touches, grows alive with beauty. And\nwhat SEEMED ugly, in the darkness of your LACK of reason, is suddenly released to\nloveliness. Not even what the Son of God made in insanity, could be without a\nhidden spark of beauty, that gentleness could release.\n\nAll this beauty will rise to bless your sight, as you look upon the\nworld with forgiving eyes. For forgiveness literally TRANSFORMS vision, and lets\nyou see the real world, reaching quietly and gently across chaos, and removing\nall illusions that had twisted your perception, and fixed it on the\npast. The smallest leaf becomes a thing of wonder, and a blade of grass a sign of\nGod's perfection. From the forgiven world, the Son of God is lifted easily to his\nhome. And there, he knows that he has ALWAYS rested there in peace.\n\nEven salvation will become a dream, and vanish from his mind. For\nsalvation IS the end of dreams, and, with the closing of the dream, will have no\nmeaning. Who, awake in Heaven, COULD dream that there could ever be NEED of\nsalvation? How much do you WANT salvation? It will GIVE you the real world,\ntrembling with readiness to BE given you. The eagerness of the Holy Spirit to\ngive you this, is so intense He would not wait, although He waits in patience.",

And, finally, why\nall such relationships become the attempt at union THROUGH THE BODY, for ONLY\nbodies CAN be seen as means for vengeance.\n\nThat bodies are central to all unholy relationships is evident. Your\nOWN experience has taught you this. But what you do NOT realize, are\nALL the reasons that go to MAKE the relationship unholy. For UNholiness seeks to\nRE-INFORCE itself, by gathering TO itself, what it perceives as LIKE itself, as\nholiness does. In the unholy relationship, it is NOT the body of the OTHER with\nwhich union is attempted, but the bodies of those WHO ARE NOT THERE. Even the\nBODY of the other, ALREADY a severely limited perception of him, is NOT the\ncentral focus as it is, or in entirety. What can be used for fantasies of\nvengeance, and what can be most readily associated with those on whom vengeance\nis REALLY sought, are centered on, and SEPARATED OFF, as being the only parts OF\nVALUE.\n\nEvery step taken in the making, the maintaining, and the breaking off\nof the unholy relationship, is a move toward further fragmentation and unreality.\nThe shadow figures enter more and more, and the one in whom they SEEM to be,\nDECREASES in importance. Time is indeed unkind to the unholy relationship. For\ntime IS cruel in the ego's hands, as it is kind when used for gentleness. The\nattraction of the unholy relationship begins to fade and to be questioned, almost\nat once. Once it is formed, doubt MUST enter in, because its purpose IS\nimpossible. The only such relationships which RETAIN the fantasies which center\non them, are the ones which have been DREAMED of, but have NOT been made at all.\n\nWhere NO reality has entered, there is NOTHING to intrude upon the\nDREAM of happiness. But consider what this means; the more of the REALITY that\nenters into the unholy relationship, the LESS SATISFYING it becomes. And the more\nthe FANTASIES can encompass, the greater the satisfaction seems to be. The\n‘ideal’ of the unholy relationship thus becomes one in which the REALITY of the\nother does not ENTER AT ALL, to ‘spoil’ the dream. And the LESS the other REALLY\nbrings to it, the ‘better’ it becomes. Thus, the attempt at union becomes a way\nof EXCLUDING even the one with whom the union was sought. For it was FORMED to\nGET HIM OUT OF IT, and join with fantasies in uninterrupted ‘bliss.’\n\nHow can the Holy Spirit bring HIS interpretation of the body, as a\nmeans of communicating into relationships whose ONLY purpose is SEPARATION from\nreality? What forgiveness IS, enables Him to do so. If all but loving thoughts\nhave been forgotten, what remains IS eternal, and the TRANSFORMED past is made\nLIKE THE PRESENT. No longer does the past CONFLICT with now. THIS continuity\nEXTENDS the present, by increasing its reality, AND ITS VALUE, in your perception\nof it. In these loving thoughts is the spark of beauty, hidden in the ugliness of\nthe unholy relationship in which the HATRED is remembered, yet there to COME\nALIVE as the relationship is given to Him Who GIVES it life and beauty.\n\nThat is why Atonement centers ON THE PAST, which is the SOURCE of\nseparation, and where it must be undone. For separation must be corrected WHERE\nIT WAS MADE. The EGO seeks to ‘resolve’ ITS problems, NOT at their source, but\nwhere they were NOT made. And thus it seeks to guarantee there WILL be no\nsolution. The Holy Spirit wills only to make HIS resolutions complete and\nperfect. And so He seeks and FINDS the source of problems WHERE IT IS, and there\nUNDOES it. And, with each step in HIS undoing, is the SEPARATION more and more\nundone, and UNION brought closer. HE is not at all confused by ANY ‘reasons’ for\nseparation. ALL He perceives in it is that it MUST BE UNDONE.\n\nLet Him uncover the hidden spark of beauty in your relationships, and\nSHOW it to you. Its loveliness will so attract you, that you will be unwilling\never to lose the sight of it again. And you will LET it transform the\nrelationship, so you can see it more and more. For you will want it more and\nmore, and become increasingly unwilling to LET it be hidden from you. And you\nwill learn to seek for, and ESTABLISH, conditions in which this, beauty CAN be\nseen. All this you will do gladly, if you but let Him hold the spark before you,\nto light your way, and make it CLEAR to you.\n\nGod's Son is one. And whom God has JOINED as one, the ego CANNOT break\napart. The spark of holiness MUST be safe, however hidden it may be,\nin EVERY relationship. For the Creator of the one relationship, has LEFT no part\nof it without HIMSELF. THIS is the only part of the relationship the Holy Spirit\nsees, because He knows that ONLY this is true. YOU have made the relationship\nunreal, and THEREFORE unholy, by seeing it WHERE it is not, and as it IS not.\nGive the past to Him Who can change YOUR mind about it, FOR you. But first, be\nSURE you fully realize what YOU have made the past to REPRESENT, and why.\n\nIn brief, the past is NOW your justification for entering into a\ncontinuing, unholy alliance with the ego AGAINST THE PRESENT. For the present IS\nforgiveness. Therefore, the relationships which the unholy alliance dictates are\nnot perceived NOR FELT as now. Yet the frame of reference to which the present is\nREFERRED for meaning, is an ILLUSION of the past, in which those elements which\nFIT the purpose of the unholy alliance are retained and ALL THE REST LET GO. And\nwhat is thus let go, is all the truth the past could ever OFFER to the present,\nas witnesses for ITS reality, while what is KEPT, but witnesses to the reality of\ndreams.\n\nIt is still up to you to choose to be willing to join with truth or\nillusion. But remember that to choose ONE, is to LET THE OTHER GO. Which one you\nchoose, YOU will endow with beauty and reality, because the choice DEPENDS on\nwhich you value more. The spark of beauty, or the veil of ugliness; the real\nworld, or the world of guilt and fear; truth or illusion; freedom or slavery, -\nit is all the same. For you can NEVER choose EXCEPT between God and the ego.\nThought-systems are but true or false, and all their ATTRIBUTES come simply from\nwhat they ARE. Only the Thoughts of God ARE true. And all that follows FROM them,\nCOMES FROM what they are, and is as true as is the holy Source from which they\ncome.\n\nMy holy brothers, I would enter into all your relationships, and step\nbetween you and your fantasies. Let MY relationship to you be REAL to you, and\nlet me bring REALITY to your perception of your brothers. They\nwere not created to enable you to HURT yourselves through them. They were created\nto CREATE with you. This is the truth that I would interpose, between you and\nyour goal of madness. Be not separate from me, and let not the holy purpose of\nAtonement be lost to you, in dreams of vengeance. Relationships in which such\ndreams are cherished have EXCLUDED me. Let me enter, in the Name of God, and\nbring YOU peace, that YOU may offer peace to me.",

    "content": "Perception and the Two Worlds\n\nGod established His relationship with you TO MAKE YOU HAPPY, and\nnothing YOU do which does NOT share His purpose CAN be real. The purpose GOD\nascribed to anything IS its only function. Because of HIS reason for creating HIS\nrelationship with you, the function of relationships became forever “to make\nhappy.” AND NOTHING ELSE. To fulfill this function, you relate to your creations\nas GOD to HIS. For nothing God created is APART from happiness, and nothing God\ncreated but would EXTEND happiness, as its Creator did. Whatever fulfills this\nfunction NOT, CANNOT BE REAL.\n\nIn this world, it is impossible to create. Yet it IS possible to make\nhappy. We have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not DEPRIVE you of your\nspecial relationships, but would TRANSFORM them. And by that, all that is meant\nis that He will RESTORE to them the function that was GIVEN them, by God. The\nfunction YOU have given them is clearly NOT to make happy. But the holy\nrelationship SHARES God's purpose, rather than aiming to make a SUBSTITUTE for\nit. Every special relationship that YOU have made IS a substitute for God's Will,\nand glorifies yours instead of His, BECAUSE OF THE DELUSION THEY ARE DIFFERENT.\n\nYou have VERY REAL relationships, even in this world, which you do not\nrecognize, simply because you have raised their SUBSTITUTES to such predominance\nthat, when truth calls to you, as it does constantly, YOU ANSWER WITH A\nSUBSTITUTE. Every special relationship which you have ever undertaken has, as its\nfundamental purpose, the aim of occupying your minds so completely that YOU WILL\nNOT HEAR the call of truth. In a sense, the special relationship was the EGO'S\nanswer to the creation of the Holy Spirit, Who was God's Answer to the\nseparation. For, although the ego did not understand WHAT had been created, it\nWAS aware of threat.\n\nThe whole defense system that the ego evolved, to PROTECT the\nseparation from the Holy Spirit, was in response to the Gift with which God\nblessed it, and BY His blessing enabled it to be HEALED. This Blessing holds,\nWITHIN ITSELF, the truth about everything. And the truth is that the Holy Spirit\nIS in close relationship with you, because, in Him, is your relationship with God\nrestored to you. The relationship with Him has never been broken, because the\nHoly Spirit has not been separate from anyone SINCE the separation. And through\nHim, have all your holy relationships been carefully preserved, to serve God's\npurpose FOR you.\n\nThe ego IS hyperalert to threat, and the part of your mind into which\nthe ego was accepted is VERY anxious to preserve its reason, AS IT SEES IT. It\ndoes NOT realize that it is totally insane. And YOU must realize JUST WHAT THIS\nMEANS, if YOU would be restored to sanity. The insane PROTECT their thought\nsystems, BUT THEY DO IT INSANELY. And ALL their defenses are AS INSANE AS WHAT\nTHEY ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT. The separation has NOTHING in it, no PART, NO\n‘reason,’ and NO attribute, that is NOT insane. And its ‘protection’ IS part of\nit, as insane as the whole.\n\nThe special relationship, which is its chief defense, MUST therefore\nbe insane. You have but little difficulty now in realizing that the thoughtsystem\nit protects, is but a system of delusions. You recognize, at least in\ngeneral terms, that the ego is insane. But the special relationship still seems\nto you somehow TO BE DIFFERENT. Yet we have looked at it far closer than at many\nother ASPECTS of the ego's thought-system which you have been more willing to let\ngo. While this ONE remains, you will not LET the others go. FOR THIS ONE IS NOT\nDIFFERENT. RETAIN this one, and you HAVE retained the whole.\n\nIt is essential to realize that ALL defenses DO what they would\nDEFEND. The underlying basis for their effectiveness is that they OFFER what they\ndefend. What they defend is placed IN them for safe-keeping, and as THEY operate,\nTHEY BRING IT TO YOU. Every defense operates BY GIVING GIFTS, and the gift is\nALWAYS a miniature of the thought-system the defense protects, set in a golden\nframe. The frame is very elaborate, all set with jewels, and deeply carved and\npolished. Its purpose is to be of value IN ITSELF, and to divert YOUR attention\nfrom what it encloses. But the frame WITHOUT the picture, you CANNOT have.\nDefenses operate TO MAKE YOU THINK YOU CAN.\n\nThe special relationship has the most imposing and deceptive frame of\nall the defenses the ego uses. Its thought-system is offered here, surrounded by\na frame so heavy and so elaborate, that the picture is almost obliterated by its\nimposing structure. Into the frame are woven all sorts of fanciful and fragmented\nillusions of love, set with dreams of sacrifice and self-aggrandizement, and\ninterlaced with gilded threads of self-destruction. The glitter of blood shines\nlike rubies, and the tears are faceted like diamonds, and gleam in the dim light\nin which the offering is made.\n\nLOOK AT THE PICTURE. Do NOT let the frame distract you. This gift is\ngiven you for your damnation, and if you TAKE it, you WILL believe that you are\ndamned. YOU CANNOT HAVE THE FRAME WITHOUT THE PICTURE. What you VALUE is the\nFRAME, for THERE you see no conflict. But the frame is only the wrapping for the\nGIFT of conflict. THE FRAME IS NOT THE GIFT. Be not deceived by the most\nsuperficial ASPECTS of this thought-system, for these aspects enclose the whole,\ncomplete with EVERY aspect. Death lies in this glittering gift. Let not your gaze\ndwell on the hypnotic gleaming of the frame. LOOK AT THE PICTURE, and realize\nthat DEATH is offered you.\n\nThat is why the holy instant is so important in the defense of truth.\nThe truth itself NEEDS no defense, but YOU DO need defense against your own\nACCEPTANCE of the gift of death. When you who ARE truth, accept an idea so\nDANGEROUS to truth, YOU THREATEN TRUTH WITH DESTRUCTION. And YOUR defense must\nnow be undertaken, TO KEEP TRUTH WHOLE. The power of Heaven, the Love of God, the\ntears of Christ and the joy of His Eternal Spirit are marshalled to defend you\nfrom your own attack. For you attack THEM, being PART of them, and they must SAVE\nyou, for they love themselves.\n\nThe Holy instant is a miniature of Heaven, sent you FROM Heaven. It is\na picture, too, set in a frame. But if you accept THIS gift, you will NOT see the\nframe at all, because the gift can only BE accepted through your willingness to\nfocus ALL your attention ON THE PICTURE. The holy instant is a miniature of\neternity. It is a picture of timelessness, set in a frame of time. If you focus\non the picture, you will realize that it was only the frame that made you THINK\nit was a picture. WITHOUT the frame, the picture IS SEEN AS WHAT IT REPRESENTS.\nFor, as the whole thought-system of the ego lies in ITS gifts, so the whole of\nHeaven lies in this instant, borrowed from eternity, and set in time for YOU.\n\nTwo gifts are offered you. Each is complete, and cannot be partially\naccepted. Each is a picture of all that you can have, SEEN VERY DIFFERENTLY. You\nCANNOT compare their value by comparing a picture to a frame. It MUST be the\nPICTURES ONLY that you compare, or the comparison is wholly without meaning.\nRemember that it is the picture that is the gift. And ONLY on this basis are you\nREALLY free to choose. LOOK AT THE PICTURES. BOTH of them. One is a tiny picture,\nhard to see at all beneath the heavy shadows of its enormous and disproportionate\nenclosure. The other is lightly framed, and hung in light, lovely to look upon\nfor what it IS.\n\nYou who have tried so hard, and are STILL trying, to fit the better\npicture into the wrong frame, and so combine what cannot BE combined, accept this\nand be glad; These pictures are each framed perfectly, for what they represent.\nOne is FRAMED to be out of focus, and NOT seen. The other is framed for perfect\nclarity. The picture of darkness and of death grows less convincing as you search\nit out amid its wrappings. As each senseless stone that SEEMS to shine in\ndarkness from the frame is EXPOSED TO LIGHT, it becomes dull and lifeless, and\nceases to distract you from the picture. And finally, you look upon the PICTURE\nITSELF, seeing at last that, unprotected by its FRAME, it HAS no meaning.\n\nThe other picture is lightly framed, for time cannot contain eternity.\nThere is NO distraction here. The picture of Heaven and eternity grows MORE\nconvincing, as you look at it.\nAnd now, by REAL comparison, a TRANSFORMATION of both pictures can at last occur.\nAnd each is given its RIGHTFUL place, when both are seen IN RELATION TO EACH\nOTHER. The dark picture, BROUGHT TO LIGHT, is NOT perceived as fearful. But the\nfact that IT IS JUST A PICTURE is brought home at last. And what you SEE there,\nYOU will recognize as what it is; a picture of what YOU THOUGHT WAS REAL, and\nnothing more. For, BEHIND this picture, YOU WILL SEE NOTHING.\n\nThe picture of light, in clear-cut and unmistakable contrast, is\ntransformed into what lies BEYOND the picture. As you look on THIS, you realize\nthat IT IS NOT A PICTURE, but a reality. This is no figured REPRESENTATION of a\nthought-system, but the Thought Itself. What IT represents is THERE. The frame\nfades gently, and God rises to your remembrance, offering you the whole of\ncreation, in exchange for your little picture, wholly without value, and entirely\ndeprived of meaning. As God ascends into HIS rightful place and you to yours, you\nwill experience again the MEANING of relationship, and know it to be true.\n\nLet us ascend, in peace together, to the Father, by giving HIM\nascendance in our minds. We will gain EVERYTHING by giving HIM the power and the\nglory, and keeping NO illusions of where they are. They ARE in us, through HIS\nascendance. What He has given is HIS. It shines in every part of Him, as in the\nWhole. The whole reality of your relationship with Him lies in OUR relationship",

    "content": "The Healed Relationship\n\nThe holy relationship is the EXPRESSION of the holy instant, in living\nin this world. Like EVERYTHING about salvation, the holy instant is a PRACTICAL\ndevice, WITNESSED by its results. The holy instant NEVER fails. The EXPERIENCE of\nit is ALWAYS felt. But, without EXPRESSION, IT IS NOT REMEMBERED. The holy\nrelationship is a constant reminder of the experience in which the relationship\nbecame what it is. And, as the UNholy relationship is a continuing hymn of hate\nin praise of ITS maker, so is the holy relationship a happy song of praise to the\nREDEEMER of relationships. The holy relationship, a MAJOR step toward the\nperception of the real world, is LEARNED. It is the old, unholy relationship,\ntransformed and seen anew.\n\nThe holy relationship is a phenomenal teaching accomplishment. In all\nits aspects, as it begins, develops, and becomes accomplished, it represents the\nREVERSAL of the unholy relationship. Be comforted in this; The ONLY difficult\nphase is the beginning. For here, the GOAL of the relationship is abruptly\nshifted to the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it was. This is the FIRST result of\nOFFERING the relationship to the Holy Spirit, to use for HIS purposes. This\ninvitation is ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY, and the Holy Spirit wastes no time in\nintroducing the practical results of asking Him to enter. AT ONCE, HIS goal\nREPLACES yours.\n\nThis is accomplished very rapidly. But it makes the relationship seem\ndisturbed, disjunctive and even quite distressing. The reason is quite clear. For\nthe relationship, AS IT IS, is out of line with its own goal, and clearly\nunsuited to the purpose which has been ACCEPTED for it. In its UNholy condition,\nYOUR goal was all that SEEMED to give it meaning. Now, it seems to make NO sense.\nMany relationships have been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the old\ngoal re-established in ANOTHER relationship. For, once the unholy relationship\nhas ACCEPTED the goal of holiness, it can\nnever again be what it was.\n\nThe temptation of the ego becomes extremely intense, with this shift\nin goals. For the relationship has NOT, as yet, been changed sufficiently to make\nits former goal completely WITHOUT attraction, and its structure is ‘threatened’\nby the recognition of its inappropriateness for meeting its new purpose. The\nconflict between the goal and the structure of the relationship is SO apparent\nthat they CANNOT co-exist. Yet now, THE GOAL WILL NOT BE CHANGED. Set firmly in\nthe unholy relationship, there IS no course except to CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP to\nfit the goal. Until this HAPPY solution is seen and accepted as the ONLY WAY OUT\nof this conflict, the RELATIONSHIP seems to be severely strained.\n\nIt would NOT be kinder to shift the goal more slowly. For the CONTRAST\nwould be obscured, and the ego given time to re-interpret each slow step,\naccording to its liking. Only a radical shift in purpose COULD induce a COMPLETE\nchange of mind about what the whole relationship IS FOR. As this change develops,\nand is finally accomplished, it grows increasingly beneficent and joyous. But, at\nthe beginning, the situation is experienced as very precarious. A relationship,\nundertaken by two individuals for their unholy purposes, suddenly has HOLINESS\nfor its goal.\n\nAs these two CONTEMPLATE their relationship from the point of view of\nthis new purpose, they are inevitably appalled. Their perception of the\nrelationship may even become quite disorganized. And yet, the FORMER organization\nof their perception, no longer serves the purpose THEY have agreed to set. THIS\nIS THE TIME FOR FAITH. You LET this goal be set for you. That WAS an act of\nfaith. Do not ABANDON faith, now that the REWARDS of faith are being introduced.\nIf you believed the Holy Spirit was THERE to ACCEPT the relationship, why would\nyou now not STILL believe that He is there,\nto PURIFY what He has taken under His guidance?\n\nHave faith in EACH OTHER in what but SEEMS to be a trying time. THE\nGOAL IS SET. And your relationship has SANITY as its purpose. Now you find\nyourselves in an INSANE relationship, RECOGNIZED as such IN THE LIGHT OF ITS\nGOAL. Now the ego counsels thus; substitute for this ANOTHER relationship, to\nwhich your FORMER goal was QUITE appropriate. You can ESCAPE from your distress,\nONLY BY GETTING RID OF EACH OTHER. You need not part entirely, if you choose not\nto do so. But you MUST exclude MAJOR AREAS of fantasy FROM each other, TO SAVE\nYOUR SANITY.\n\nHear not this now! Have faith in Him Who ANSWERED you. He heard; has\nHe not been very explicit in His answer? You are NOT now wholly insane. Can you\nDENY that He HAS given a MOST explicit statement? Now He asks for faith a little\nlonger, even in bewilderment. For this will go, and you will see the\nJUSTIFICATION for your faith emerge, to bring you shining conviction. Abandon Him\nnot now, NOR EACH OTHER. This relationship HAS BEEN reborn as holy. Accept with\ngladness what you do not understand, and LET it be explained to you, as you\nperceive its purpose work in it, to MAKE it holy.\n\nYou will find many opportunities to blame EACH OTHER for the ‘failure’\nof your relationship. For it will seem, at times, to have NO purpose. A sense of\naimlessness will come to haunt you, and to remind you of all the ways you once\nSOUGHT for satisfaction, and THOUGHT you found it. Forget not now the misery you\nREALLY found. And do not now breathe live into your failing egos. For your\nrelationship has NOT been disrupted. IT HAS BEEN SAVED. You are very new in the\nways of salvation, and think you have LOST your way. YOUR way IS lost, but think\nnot this is LOSS.\n\nIn your newness, remember that you have started again, TOGETHER. And\ntake each other's hand, to walk together along a road far more familiar than you\nnow believe. Is it not certain, that you will remember a goal unchanged\nthroughout eternity? For you have chosen but the goal of God, from which your\ntrue intent was NEVER absent. Throughout the Sonship is the song of freedom\nheard, in joyous echo of your choice. You have joined with many, in the holy\ninstant, and THEY have joined with you. Think not your choice will leave YOU\ncomfortless. For God Himself has blessed your special relationship. JOIN in His\nblessing, and withhold not yours upon it. For all it needs now IS your blessing,\nthat you may see that in it rests salvation.\n\nCondemn salvation not, for it HAS come to you. And welcome it\nTOGETHER, for it has come to JOIN you together, in a relationship in which ALL\nthe Sonship is together blessed. You undertook, TOGETHER to invite the Holy\nSpirit into your relationship. He could not have entered otherwise. And, though\nyou have made many mistakes since then, you have also made enormous efforts to\nhelp Him do His work. And He has NOT been lacking in appreciation for all you\nhave done for Him, nor does He see the mistakes at all.\n\nHave you been similarly grateful to each other? Have you consistently\nappreciated the GOOD efforts, and OVERLOOKED mistakes? Or has your appreciation\nflickered and grown dim, in what SEEMED to be the LIGHT of the mistakes? You are\nnow entering upon a campaign to blame EACH OTHER for the discomfort of the\nsituation in which you find yourselves. And by this LACK of thanks and gratitude,\nyou make YOURSELVES unable to EXPRESS the holy instant, and thus you lose sight\nof it. The experience of an instant, HOWEVER compelling\nit may be, is easily forgotten, if you allow time to close over it. It must be\nkept shining and gracious, in your AWARENESS of time, but not CONCEALED within\nit. The instant remains. But where are YOU?\n\nTo give thanks to each other is to APPRECIATE the holy instant, and\nthus enable its RESULTS to be accepted AND SHARED. To ATTACK each other is not to\nLOSE the instant, but TO MAKE IT POWERLESS IN ITS EFFECTS. You HAVE received the\nholy instant, but you have established a condition IN WHICH YOU CANNOT USE IT. As\na result, you do not realize that it is WITH YOU STILL. And, by CUTTING YOURSELF\nOFF from its EXPRESSION, you have denied yourself its benefit. You REINFORCE\nthis, every time YOU ATTACK EACH OTHER, for the attack MUST blind you to\nYOURSELF. And it IS impossible to DENY yourself, and recognize what has been\ngiven, and RECEIVED by you.\n\nYou stand together in the holy Presence of Truth Itself. Here is the\ngoal, together WITH you. Think you not the goal ITSELF will gladly arrange the\nMEANS for its accomplishment? It is just this same DISCREPANCY between the\npurpose which has BEEN accepted and the means as they stand now, that SEEMS to\nmake you suffer, but which makes Heaven glad. If Heaven were OUTSIDE you, you\ncould NOT share in its gladness. But, because it is WITHIN, the gladness, too, IS\nyours. You ARE joined in purpose, but remain still separate and divided on the\nmeans. Yet the GOAL is fixed, firm and unalterable. And the means will surely\nfall in place, BECAUSE the goal is sure.\n\nAnd YOU will share the gladness of the Sonship that it is so. As you\nbegin to recognize, and ACCEPT the gifts you have so freely given to EACH OTHER,\nyou will also accept the EFFECTS of the holy instant, and use them to correct ALL\nyour mistakes, and free you from THEIR results. And, learning this, you will have\nALSO learned how to release ALL the Sonship, and offer it in gladness and\nthanksgiving to Him Who gave you YOUR release, and Who would EXTEND it through\nyou.",

    "content": "Practical Forgiveness\n\nThe practical application of the Holy Spirit's purpose is extremely\nsimple, but it IS unequivocal. In fact, in ORDER to be simple, it MUST be\nunequivocal. The simple is merely what is EASILY UNDERSTOOD, and for this, it is\napparent that IT MUST BE CLEAR. The setting of the Holy Spirit's goal is GENERAL.\nNow He will work WITH you, TO MAKE IT SPECIFIC, for application IS specific.\nThere are certain VERY specific guidelines He provides for ANY situation, but\nremember that you do not yet realize their universal application. Therefore, it\nis essential, at this point, to use them in each situation separately, until you\ncan more safely look BEYOND each situation, in an understanding far broader than\nyou now possess.\n\nIn any situation in which YOU are uncertain, the FIRST thing to\nconsider, very simply, is, “What do I want to come of this? What is it FOR?” The\nclarification of the goal belongs at the BEGINNING, for it is this that will\nDETERMINE the outcome. In the ego's procedure, this is reversed. The SITUATION\nbecomes the determiner of the outcome, WHICH CAN BE ANYTHING. The reason for this\ndisorganized approach is evident. The ego does not know what it WANTS to come of\nit. It IS aware of what it does NOT want, but only that. It has no POSITIVE goal\nat all.\n\nWithout a clear-cut, positive goal, set at the outset, the situation\njust seems to happen, and makes no sense until it has ALREADY HAPPENED. Then you\nlook BACK at it, and try to piece together what it MUST have meant. AND YOU WILL\nBE WRONG. Not only is your judgment IN THE PAST, but you have no idea what SHOULD\nhave happened. No goal was set, with which to bring the means IN LINE. And now,\nthe only judgment LEFT to make is whether or not the ego LIKES it; is it\nacceptable, or does it call for vengeance. The absence of a criterion for\noutcome, SET IN ADVANCE, makes understanding doubtful\nand evaluation impossible.\n\nThe value of deciding, in advance, what you WANT to happen, is simply\nthat you will perceive the situation as a means to MAKE it happen. You will\ntherefore make every effort to OVERLOOK what interferes with the accomplishment\nof your objective, and concentrate on everything that helps you meet it. It is\nquite noticeable that THIS approach has brought you closer to the Holy Spirit's\nSORTING OUT of truth and falsity. The \"true\" becomes what can be used to MEET the\ngoal. The \"false\" becomes the useless FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW. The situation now\nHAS meaning, but only because the goal has MADE it meaningful.\n\nThe goal of truth has further practical advantages. If the situation\nis used for truth and sanity, its outcome MUST be peace. And this is quite APART\nfrom what the outcome IS. For if peace is the CONDITION of truth and sanity, and\nCANNOT be WITHOUT them, where peace is, they MUST be. Truth comes of itself. If\nyou experience PEACE, it is because the truth HAS come to you. And you WILL see\nthe outcome truly, for deception can not prevail against you. And you will\nRECOGNIZE the outcome, BECAUSE you are at peace. Here, again, you see the\nOPPOSITE of the ego's way of looking. For the EGO believes the situation BRINGS\nthe experience. The Holy Spirit knows the situation IS as the goal determines it,\nand is experienced ACCORDING to the goal.\n\nThe goal of truth REQUIRES FAITH. Faith is implicit in the acceptance\nof the Holy Spirit's purpose. AND THIS FAITH IS ALL-INCLUSIVE. Where the goal of\ntruth is set, there faith MUST be. The Holy Spirit sees the situation AS A WHOLE.\nThe goal establishes the fact that EVERYONE involved in it WILL play his part in\nits accomplishment. THIS IS INEVITABLE. No-one will fail in anything.\nThis SEEMS to ask for faith BEYOND you, and beyond what you can GIVE. But this is\nso ONLY from the viewpoint of the ego, for the ego believes in ‘solving’\nconflicts through FRAGMENTATION, and does NOT perceive the situation as a whole.\nTherefore, it seeks to split off SEGMENTS of the situation and deal with them\nSEPARATELY. For it has faith in separation, and NOT in wholeness.\n\nConfronted with any ASPECT of the situation which SEEMS to be\ndifficult, the ego will attempt to TAKE THIS ASPECT ELSEWHERE, and resolve it\nthere. And it will SEEM to be successful. Except that this attempt CONFLICTS WITH\nUNITY, and MUST obscure the goal of truth. And peace will not be experienced,\nEXCEPT in fantasy. Truth has NOT come, because faith has been DENIED, being\nWITHHELD from where it rightfully belonged. Thus do you LOSE the understanding of\nthe situation the goal of truth would bring. For fantasy solutions bring but the\nILLUSION of experience, and the illusion of peace is NOT the condition in which\nthe truth can enter.\n\nThe substitutes for ASPECTS of the situation are the witnesses to your\nLACK of faith. They demonstrate that you did NOT believe that the solution AND\nTHE PROBLEM were in the same place. The problem WAS this lack of faith. And it is\nTHIS you demonstrate, when you REMOVE it from its source, and place it elsewhere.\nAs a result, YOU DO NOT SEE THE PROBLEM. Had you not lacked the faith it COULD be\nsolved, the PROBLEM would be gone. And the situation would have been MEANINGFUL",

    "content": "The Need for Faith\n\nThere is NO problem in ANY situation that faith will not solve. There\nis no SHIFT in any ASPECT of the problem, but will make SOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE.\nFor if you shift PART of a problem elsewhere, the meaning of the problem MUST be\nlost, and the SOLUTION to the problem is INHERENT in its meaning. Is it not\npossible that ALL your problems HAVE BEEN solved, but you have removed YOURSELF\nfrom the solution? Yet faith MUST be where something has BEEN done, and where you\nSEE it done. A situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts. If\nproblems are perceived, it is because the thoughts are judged to be IN CONFLICT.\nBut if the goal is TRUTH, this is impossible. Some idea of bodies MUST have\nentered, for minds can NOT attack.\n\nThe thought of bodies IS the sign of faithlessness, for bodies CANNOT\nsolve anything. And it is their INTRUSION on the relationship, an error in YOUR\nthoughts ABOUT the situation, that then became the JUSTIFICATION for your lack of\nfaith. You WILL make this error, but be not at all concerned with that. The error\ndoes not matter. But do not USE the error to what SEEMS to be to your advantage,\nfor that DOES matter. Faithlessness brought to faith, will never interfere with\ntruth. But faithlessness used AGAINST truth will ALWAYS destroy faith. If you\nlack faith, ask that it be restored WHERE IT WAS LOST, and seek not to have it\nMADE UP TO YOU elsewhere, as if you had been unjustly DEPRIVED of it.\n\nOnly what YOU have not given CAN be lacking in ANY situation. But\nremember this; the goal of holiness was set for YOUR relationship, AND NOT BY\nYOU. YOU did not set it, because holiness can NOT BE SEEN except through faith,\nand your relationship was not holy BECAUSE your faith in one another was so\nlimited and little. Your faith must grow, to meet the goal that has been set. The\ngoal's REALITY will call this forth. For you will see that peace and faith will\nnot come separately. What situation can you be in WITHOUT FAITH, and remain\nfaithful to each other? EVERY situation in which\nyou find yourselves, is but a means to meet the purpose set for YOUR\nrelationship. See it as something ELSE, and you ARE faithless.\n\nUSE NOT YOUR FAITHLESSNESS. Let it enter, and look upon it calmly, but\nDO NOT USE IT. Faithlessness is the servant of illusion, and wholly faithful to\nits master. USE it, and it will carry you straight to illusions. Be tempted not\nby what it offers you. It interferes, not with the goal, but with the VALUE of\nthe goal TO YOU. Accept not the illusion of peace it offers, but look upon its\noffering, and recognize it IS illusion. The GOAL of illusion is as closely tied\nto faithlessness, as faith to truth. If you lack faith in ANYONE to fulfill, AND\nPERFECTLY, his part in ANY situation dedicated IN ADVANCE to truth, YOUR\ndedication is divided. And so you have been faithless TO EACH OTHER, and USED\nyour faithlessness AGAINST each other.\n\nNo relationship is holy, unless its holiness goes with it EVERYWHERE.\nAs holiness and faith go hand in hand, so must its faith go everywhere WITH it.\nThe goal's reality will call forth, AND ACCOMPLISH, every miracle needed for its\nfulfillment. Nothing too small or too enormous, nothing too insignificant or too\nimposing, too weak or too compelling, but will be gently turned to its use and\npurpose. The universe will serve it gladly, as it serves the universe. BUT DO NOT\nINTERFERE. The power set in you, in whom the Holy Spirit's goal has been\nestablished, is so far beyond your little conception of the infinite, that you\nhave no idea how great the strength that goes with you.\n\nAnd you can use THIS in perfect safety. Yet, for all its might, so\ngreat it reaches past the stars and to the universe that lies beyond them, your\nlittle faithlessness can make IT useless, if you would use the faithlessness\ninstead. But think on this, and learn the CAUSE of faithlessness; you think you\nhold against another what he has done to you. But what you REALLY blame\nhim for is WHAT YOU DID TO HIM. It is not HIS past but YOURS, you hold against\nhim. And you lack faith in HIM, because of what YOU were. Yet YOU are as innocent\nof what you were, as HE is. What never was is causeless, and IS NOT THERE to\ninterfere with truth. There IS no cause for faithlessness, but there IS a Cause\nfor faith.\n\nThat Cause has entered ANY situation that shares its purpose. The\nlight of truth shines from the center of the situation, and touches everyone to\nwhom the situation's purpose calls. IT CALLS TO EVERYONE. There is NO situation\nthat does NOT involve your WHOLE RELATIONSHIP, in every aspect and complete in\nevery part. You can leave NOTHING of yourself outside it, and keep the situation\nholy. For it shares the purpose of your whole relationship, and derives its\nmeaning FROM it. Enter each situation with the faith that you would give each\nother, or you ARE faithless to your own relationship. YOUR faith will call the\nothers to SHARE your purpose, as this same purpose called forth the faith in you.\n\nAnd you will see the means you once employed to lead you to illusions,\ntransformed to means for truth. Truth calls for faith, and faith makes room FOR\nTRUTH. When the Holy Spirit CHANGED the purpose of your relationship by\nexchanging yours for His, the goal He placed there WAS extended to every\nsituation in which you entered, or will EVER enter. And EVERY situation was thus\nMADE FREE of the past, which WOULD have made it purposeLESS. You CALL FOR faith,\nbecause of Him Who walks with you in every situation. You are no longer wholly\ninsane, NOR NO LONGER ALONE. For loneliness in God MUST be a dream. You whose\nrelationship SHARES the Holy Spirit's goal, are SET APART from loneliness,\nbecause the truth has come. Its call for faith is strong. Use not your\nfaithlessness against it, for it calls you to salvation and to peace.",

    "content": "The Conditions of Forgiveness\n\nThe holy instant is nothing more than a special case, or an extreme\nexample, of what EVERY situation is MEANT to be. The meaning that the Holy\nSpirit's purpose has GIVEN it, is also given to EVERY situation. It calls forth\njust the same SUSPENSION of faithlessness, withheld and left UNUSED, that faith\nmight answer to the call of truth. The holy instant is the shining example, the\nclear and unequivocal demonstration of the meaning of EVERY relationship, and\nEVERY situation SEEN AS A WHOLE. Faith has ACCEPTED every ASPECT of the\nsituation, and faithlessness has not forced ANY exclusion on it. It is a\nsituation of perfect peace, simply because YOU have LET IT BE WHAT IT IS.\n\nThis simple courtesy is all the Holy Spirit asks of you. Let Truth be\nwhat it is. Do not INTRUDE upon it, do not ATTACK it, do NOT interrupt its\ncoming. Let it encompass EVERY situation, and bring you peace. Not even faith is\nasked of you, for Truth asks nothing. Let it enter, and IT will call forth, and\nSECURE for you, the faith you need for peace. But rise you not AGAINST it, for\nagainst YOUR opposition it CANNOT come. Would you not WANT to make a holy instant\nof EVERY situation? For such is the gift of faith, freely given wherever\nfaithlessness is laid aside, UNUSED.\n\nAnd THEN the power of the Holy Spirit's purpose is free for use\ninstead. This power INSTANTLY transforms ALL situations into one sure and\ncontinuous means for ESTABLISHING His purpose, and DEMONSTRATING its reality.\nWhat has been DEMONSTRATED has called for faith, and has been GIVEN it. Now it\nbecomes a fact, from which faith can no longer BE withheld. The strain of\nREFUSING faith to truth is enormous, and far greater than you realize. But to\nANSWER truth with faith entails no strain at all.\n\nTo you who have ACKNOWLEDGED the call of your Redeemer, the strain of\nNOT responding to His call SEEMS to be GREATER than before. This is not so.\nBefore, the strain was there, but you attributed it TO SOMETHING ELSE, believing\nthat the ‘something else’ PRODUCED it. This was NEVER true. But what the\n‘something else’ produced was sorrow and depression, sickness and pain, darkness\nand dim imaginings of terror, cold fantasies of fear, and fiery dreams of hell.\nAnd it was nothing but the intolerable strain of your refusal to give faith to\ntruth, and see its evident reality.\n\nSuch was the crucifixion of the Son of God. His faithlessness did this\nto him. Think carefully before you let yourself use faithlessness against him.\nFor he IS risen, and YOU have accepted the cause of his awakening AS YOURS. You\nhave assumed your part in his redemption, and you are now fully responsible to\nhim. Fail him not now, for it has been given you to realize what your lack of\nfaith in him MUST mean to YOU. His salvation is your ONLY purpose. See only this\nin EVERY situation, and it WILL be a means for bringing ONLY this.\n\nWhen you accepted truth as the goal for your relationship, you became\ngivers of peace, as surely as your Father gave peace to YOU. For the goal of\npeace cannot BE accepted, APART from its conditions. And you had faith in it, for\nno-one accepts what he does NOT believe is REAL. YOUR PURPOSE HAS NOT CHANGED,\nand WILL not change, for you ACCEPTED what can NEVER change. And nothing that it\nneeds to BE forever changeless, can you now WITHHOLD from it. Your release is",

If you would but consider exactly\nwhat this entails, you would perceive at once how much at variance this is with\nthe goal the Holy Spirit has given you and would accomplish FOR you. To\nsubstitute is to CHOOSE BETWEEN, renouncing one IN FAVOR of the other. For this\nSPECIAL purpose, one is judged more valuable, and the other is REPLACED by him.\nThe relationship in which the substitution occurred is thus fragmented, and ITS\nPURPOSE SPLIT accordingly. To fragment IS TO EXCLUDE, and substitution is the\nstrongest defense the ego has for separation.\n\nThe Holy Spirit NEVER substitutes. Where the ego perceives one person\nas a REPLACEMENT FOR another, the Holy Spirit sees them joined and indivisible.\nHe does not judge BETWEEN them, KNOWING they are one. Being united, they are one\nBECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME. Substitution is clearly a process in which they are\nPERCEIVED AS DIFFERENT. One would UNITE; the other SEPARATE.

    "content": "Substitution as a Defense\n\nYou who believe that God is fear made but ONE substitution. It has\ntaken many forms, because it was the substitution of fragmentation for wholeness.\nIt has become splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it\nis now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still IS what it was.\nThat ONE error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life to\ndeath, was all you ever made. Your whole world rests upon it. Everything you see\nreflects it. And every special relationship you ever made is PART of it.\n\nYou have expressed surprise at hearing how VERY different is reality\nfrom what YOU see. You do not realize the magnitude of that ONE error. It was so\nvast and so COMPLETELY incredible, that from it, a world of total unreality HAD\nto emerge. What else COULD come of it? Its fragmented ASPECTS are fearful enough,\nas you begin to LOOK at them. But nothing you have ever seen BEGINS to show you\nthe enormity of the ORIGINAL error, which seemed to cast you out of Heaven, to\nshatter knowledge into meaningless bits of disunited perceptions, and TO FORCE\nYOU TO FURTHER SUBSTITUTIONS.\n\nThat was the first projection of error outward. The world arose to\nhide it, and became the screen on which it was projected, and drawn between you\nand truth. For truth extends INWARD, where the idea of loss is meaningless, and\nonly INCREASE is conceivable. Do you REALLY think it strange that a world in\nwhich EVERYTHING is backward and upside-down, arose from this? IT WAS INEVITABLE.\nFor truth brought to THIS could only remain within in quiet, and take no part in\nall the mad projection by which this world was made.\n\nCall it not sin, but madness, for such it was, and so it still\nremains. Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished IN\nREALITY. And, above all, BE NOT AFRAID OF IT. When you seem to see some twisted\nform of the original error rise to frighten you, say only, ‘God is NOT fear, but\nlove,’ and it will disappear. THE TRUTH WILL SAVE YOU. It has NOT left you,\nto go out into the mad world and so DEPART FROM YOU. Inward is sanity; INsanity\nis OUTSIDE you. You but BELIEVE it is the other way; that truth is OUTSIDE, and\nerror and guilt within.\n\nYour little, senseless substitutions, touched with insanity, and\nswirling lightly off on a mad course like a feather dancing insanely in the wind,\nHAVE no substance. They fuse and merge and separate in shifting and totally\nmeaningless patterns, which need not be judged at all. To judge them INDIVIDUALLY\nis pointless. Their tiny differences in form are not REAL differences at all.\nNONE OF THEM MATTERS. THAT they have in common, and nothing else, but what else\nis NECESSARY to make them all the same? Let them go, dancing in the wind, dipping\nand turning 'til they disappear from sight, far, far OUTSIDE you. And turn you to\nthe stately calm within, where, in holy stillness, dwells the living God you\nnever left, and Who never left you.\n\nThe Holy Spirit takes you gently by the hand, and retraces WITH you\nyour mad journey OUTSIDE yourself, leading you gently back to the truth and\nsafety within. He brings all your insane projections and your wild substitutions\nwhich YOU have placed OUTSIDE you, to the truth. Thus, He REVERSES the course of\ninsanity, and restores you to reason. In your relationship where He has taken\ncharge of everything at your request, He has set the course inward, to the truth\nyou SHARE. In the mad world OUTSIDE you, nothing CAN be shared, but only\nSUBSTITUTED, and sharing and substituting have NOTHING in common in reality.\n\nWithin yourselves, you love each other with perfect love. Here is holy\nground, in which no substitutes can enter, and where only the TRUTH about each\nother can abide. Here you are joined in God, as much together as you are with\nHim. The original error has not entered here, nor ever will. Here is the\nradiant truth, to which the Holy Spirit submitted your relationship.\nLet Him bring it here, where YOU would have it be. Give Him but a little faith in\neach other, to help Him show you that no substitute you made for Heaven can keep\nyou from it.\n\nIn you there is no separation, and no substitute can keep you from\neach other. Your reality was GOD'S creation, and HAS no substitute. You are so\nfirmly joined in truth, that only God is there. And He could NEVER accept\nsomething else INSTEAD of you. He loves you both, equally and as one. And as He\nloves you, so you ARE. You are NOT joined together by illusions, but in the\nThought so holy and so perfect that illusions cannot remain to darken the holy\nplace in which you stand together. God is with you, my brothers. Let us join in\nHim in peace and gratitude, and accept His gift of our most holy and perfect\nreality, that we share in Him.\n\nHeaven is restored to all the Sonship through your relationship. For\nin it lies the Sonship, whole and beautiful, safe in your love. Heaven has\nanswered quietly, for all illusions have been gently brought unto the truth in\nyou, and Love has shined upon you, blessing your relationship with truth. God and\nHis whole Creation has entered it together. How lovely and how holy is your\nrelationship, with the truth shining upon it! Heaven beholds it, and rejoices\nthat you have let it come to you. And God Himself is glad that your relationship\nis as it was created. The universe within you stands with you together. And\nHeaven looks with love on what is joined in it, along with its Creator.\n\nWhom God hath called should hear no substitutes. Their call is but an\necho of the original error which shattered Heaven. For what became of peace, in\nthose who heard? Return with me to Heaven, walking together out of this world,\nand through another to the loveliness and joy the other holds within it. Would\nyou still further weaken and break apart what is already broken and hopeless? Is it HERE that you would look for happiness? Or would you\nnot prefer to HEAL what has been broken, and join in making whole what has been\nravaged by separation and disease?\n\nYou have been called, together, to the most holy function that this\nworld contains. It is the ONLY one that has no limits, and that reaches out to\nevery broken fragment of the Sonship, with healing and uniting comfort. This is\noffered YOU, in your holy relationship. Accept it HERE, and you WILL give as you\nhave accepted and received. The peace of God is given you, with the glowing\npurpose in which you join. The holy light that brought you together MUST extend,\nas YOU accept it.",

    "content": "The Basis of the Dream\n\nDoes not a world that seems quite real arise in dreams? But think what\nthis world is. It is clearly NOT the world you saw BEFORE you slept. Rather, it\nis a DISTORTION of the world, planned solely around what you would have\nPREFERRED. Here, you are ‘free’ to make over whatever SEEMED to attack you, and\nCHANGE it into a TRIBUTE to your ego, which was outraged by the attack. This\nwould not be YOUR wish unless you saw yourself AS ONE with the ego, which ALWAYS\nlooks upon itself, and therefore on you, as UNDER attack, and highly VULNERABLE\nto it.\n\nDreams are chaotic BECAUSE they are governed by your conflicting\nwishes. And therefore they have NO concern with what is true. They are the best\nexample you could have of how perception can be utilized to substitute illusions\nfor truth. You do not take them seriously on awaking, because the fact that, in\nthem, reality is so OUTRAGEOUSLY violated, becomes apparent. Yet they ARE a way\nof LOOKING at the world, and CHANGING it TO SUIT THE EGO BETTER. They provide\nSTRIKING examples, both of the ego's INABILITY to tolerate reality, and your\nwillingness to CHANGE reality on its behalf.\n\nYou do not find the differences between what you see in sleep and on\nawaking disturbing. You recognize that what you see on waking is blotted out in\ndreams. Yet, on awakening, you do NOT expect it to be gone. In dreams, YOU\narrange everything. People BECOME what you would have them be, and what they do\nYOU order. No limits on substitution are laid upon you; for a time, it seems as\nif the world were GIVEN you, to make it what you will. You do NOT realize that\nYOU are ATTACKING it, trying to triumph over it and MAKE it serve you.\n\nDreams are perceptual temper tantrums, in which you literally scream,\n‘I want it THUS!’ And thus it seems to be. And yet, the dream can NOT escape its\norigin. Anger and fear pervade it, and in an instant the illusion of satisfaction\nis invaded by the illusion of terror. For the\ndream of your ability to CONTROL reality by substituting a world that you prefer\nIS terrifying. Your attempts to BLOT OUT reality are VERY fearful, but THIS you\nare NOT willing to accept. And so you SUBSTITUTE the fantasy that REALITY is\nfearful, NOT what you would DO to it. And thus is guilt MADE REAL.\n\nDreams show you that you HAVE the power to make a world as you would\nhave it, and that, BECAUSE you WANT it, you SEE it. And WHILE you see it, you do\nNOT doubt that it is real. Yet here is a world, clearly WITHIN your mind, that\nSEEMS to be outside. You do NOT respond to it as though you made it, nor do you\nrealize that the emotions which the dream produces MUST come from you. It is the\nFIGURES in the dream, and what THEY do that seem to MAKE THE DREAM. You do not\nrealize that you are making them act out FOR you, for if you did, the guilt would\nnot be theirs, and the illusion of satisfaction would be gone.\n\nIn dreams these features are not obscure. You seem to waken, and the\ndream is gone. But what you fail to recognize is that what CAUSED the dream, has\nNOT gone with it. Your WISH to make another world that is NOT real, REMAINS with\nyou. And what you seem to WAKE to, is but another FORM of this same world you see\nin dreams. All your time is spent in dreaming. Your sleeping and your waking\ndreams have different forms, and that is all. THEIR CONTENT IS THE SAME. They are\nyour protest AGAINST reality, and your fixed and insane wish to CHANGE it.\n\nIn your WAKING dreams, the special relationship has a special place.\nIt is the means by which you try to make your SLEEPING dreams COME TRUE. From\nthis, you do not waken. The special relationship is your DETERMINATION to keep\nyour hold on unreality, and to PREVENT yourself from waking. And while you see\nmore VALUE in sleeping than in waking, you will NOT let go of it. The Holy\nSpirit, ever practical in His wisdom, ACCEPTS your dreams, and uses them\nas means for WAKING. YOU would have used them to remain ASLEEP.\n\nWe once said that the first change, before dreams disappear, is that\nyour dreams of fear are changed to HAPPY dreams. That is what the Holy Spirit\ndoes in your special relationship. He does NOT destroy it, nor snatch it away\nfrom you. But He does use it differently, as a help to make HIS purpose REAL to\nyou. Your special relationships will remain, NOT as a source of pain and guilt,\nbut as a source of joy and freedom. It will NOT be for you alone, for therein lay\nits misery. As its UNholiness kept it as a thing apart, its HOLINESS will become\nan offering to everyone.\n\nYour special relationship will be a means for UNDOING guilt in\neveryone blessed through your holy relationship. It will be a happy dream, and\none which you will SHARE with all who come within your sight. Through it, the\nblessing that the Holy Spirit has laid upon it, will be EXTENDED. Think not that\nHe has forgotten anyone, in the purpose He has given you. And think not that He\nhas forgotten YOU, to whom He GAVE this gift. He uses everyone who calls on Him,\nas means for the salvation of everyone. And He will waken everyone through you,\nwho offered your relationship to Him.\n\nIf you but recognized His gratitude! Or mine through His! For we are\njoined as one in purpose, being of one mind with Him. Let not the dream take hold\nto close your eyes. It is not strange that dreams can make a world that is\nunreal. The WISH to make it IS incredible. Your relationship has become one in\nwhich the wish has been REMOVED, because its purpose has been changed from one of\ndreams to one of truth. You are not sure of this, because you think it may be\nTHIS that is the dream. You are so used to choosing between dreams, you do not\nsee that you have made, at last, the choice between the truth and ALL ILLUSIONS.\n\nYet Heaven IS sure. THIS IS NO DREAM. Its coming means that you have\nchosen truth, and it has come, because you have been willing to let your special\nrelationship meet its conditions. In your relationship, the Holy Spirit has\ngently laid the real world; the world of happy dreams, from which awaking is so\neasy and so natural. For, as your sleeping and your waking dreams represent the\nsame wishes in YOUR mind, so do the real world and the truth of Heaven join in",

    "content": "Light in the Dream\n\nYou who have spent your lives in bringing truth to illusion, reality\nto fantasy, HAVE walked the way of dreams. For you have gone from waking to\nsleeping, and on and on to a yet deeper sleep. Each dream has led to other\ndreams, and every fantasy that SEEMED to bring a light into the darkness but made\nthe darkness deeper. Your GOAL was darkness, in which no ray of light could\nenter. And you sought a blackness so complete that you could hide from truth\nforever, in complete insanity. What you forgot was simply that God can NOT\ndestroy Himself. The light is IN you. Darkness can COVER it, but CANNOT put it\nout.\n\nAs the light comes nearer, you WILL rush to darkness, shrinking from\nthe truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to\nstark terror. But you WILL advance, because your goal IS the advance from fear to\ntruth. YOU KNOW THIS. The goal which you accepted IS the goal of knowledge, for\nwhich you signified your willingness. Fear seems to live in darkness. WHEN YOU\nARE AFRAID, you have stepped back. Let us then join quickly in an instant of\nlight, and it will be enough to remind you that your goal IS light. Truth has\nrushed to meet you, since YOU called upon it.\n\nIf you knew Who walks beside you on THIS way, which YOU have chosen,\nfear would be impossible. You do NOT know, because the journey into darkness has\nbeen long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. A little flicker of your\neyelids, closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in\nyourselves, so long despised. You go TOWARD love, still hating it, and TERRIBLY\nafraid of its judgment upon you. And you do NOT realize that you are NOT afraid\nof love, but only OF WHAT YOU MADE OF IT.\n\nYou are advancing to love's MEANING, and away from ALL illusions in\nwhich you have surrounded it. When you retreat to the illusions, YOUR FEAR\nINCREASES, for there is little doubt that what YOU think it means IS fearful. But\nwhat is that to us who travel surely and very swiftly AWAY from fear? You who\nhold each other's hand also hold mine, for when you joined each other you were\nnot alone. Do you believe that I would LEAVE you in the darkness you agreed to\nleave with ME? In your relationship is this world's light. And fear MUST\ndisappear before you now.\n\nBe tempted not to snatch away the gift of faith you offered to each\nother. You will succeed only in frightening yourselves. The gift is given\nforever, for God Himself received it. You CANNOT take it back. YOU HAVE ACCEPTED\nGOD. The holiness of your relationship is established in Heaven. You do not\nrealize WHAT you accepted, but remember that your understanding is NOT necessary.\nAll that was necessary was merely the WISH to understand. That wish was the\nDESIRE TO BE HOLY. The will of God IS granted you. For you desire the only thing\nyou ever had, or ever were.\n\nEach instant that we spend together will teach you that this goal is\npossible, and will strengthen your DESIRE to reach it. And in your desire lies\nits accomplishment. YOUR desire is now in complete accord with all the power of\nthe Holy Spirit's Will. No little, faltering footsteps that you may take can\nseparate your desire from His Will and from His STRENGTH. I hold your hand as\nsurely as you agreed to take each other's. YOU WILL NOT SEPARATE for I stand with\nyou, and walk with you in your advance to truth. And where we go we carry God\nwith us.\n\nIn your relationship, you have joined with me in bringing Heaven to\nthe Son of God, who hid in darkness. You have been willing to bring the darkness\nto light, and this willingness has given strength to everyone who would REMAIN in\ndarkness. Those who would see WILL see. And they will join with me in carrying\nTHEIR light into the darkness, when the darkness in them is OFFERED to the light,\nand is removed forever. My need for you, joined with me in the holy light of your\nrelationship, is YOUR need for salvation. Would I not give you what you gave to\nme? For when you joined each other, you answered ME.\n\nYou who are now the bringers of salvation have the function of\nbringing light to darkness. The darkness in you HAS been brought to light. Carry\nit back TO darkness, from the holy instant to which you BROUGHT it. We are made\nwhole in our desire to make whole. Let not time worry you, for all the fear that\nyou experience is really past. Time has been re-adjusted to help us do, together,\nwhat your separate pasts would hinder. You have gone PAST fear, for no two minds\ncan JOIN in the desire for love without love's joining THEM.\n\nNot one light in Heaven but goes with you. Not one ray that shines\nforever in the Mind of God but shines on you. Heaven is JOINED with you in your\nadvance to Heaven. When such great light has joined with you to give the little\nspark of your desire the power of God Himself, can YOU remain in darkness? You\nare coming home together, after a long and meaningless journey which you\nundertook apart, and which led nowhere. You have FOUND each other, and will light",

    "content": "The Little Willingness\n\nThe holy instant is the RESULT of your determination to be holy. It is\nthe ANSWER. The desire and the willingness to let it come PRECEDE its coming. YOU\nprepare your minds for it ONLY to the extent of RECOGNIZING that you want it\nabove all else. It is not necessary that you do more; indeed, it is necessary\nthat you realize that you can NOT do more. Do not attempt to give the Holy Spirit\nwhat He does NOT ask, or you will add the ego unto Him, and CONFUSE THE TWO. He\nasks but little. It is HE Who adds the greatness and the might. He JOINS with you\nto make the holy instant far greater than you can understand.\n\nIt is your realization that you NEED do so little that enables HIM to\ngive so much. Trust not your good intentions. They are not enough. But trust\nIMPLICITLY your willingness, whatever else may enter. Concentrate only on this,\nand be NOT disturbed that shadows surround it. THAT IS WHY YOU CAME. If you could\ncome WITHOUT them, you would not NEED the holy instant. Come to it not in\narrogance, assuming that YOU must achieve the state its coming brings with it.\nThe miracle of the holy instant lies in your willingness to let it be what it is.\nAnd in your willingness for THIS, lies also your acceptance of yourself as YOU\nwere meant to be.\n\nHumility will NEVER ask that you remain content with littleness. But\nit DOES require that you be NOT content with less than greatness which comes NOT\nof you. Your difficulty with the holy instant arises from your fixed conviction\nthat you are not WORTHY of it. And what is this but the determination to BE as\nyou would MAKE YOURSELF? God did not create His dwelling-place unworthy of Him.\nAnd if you believe He cannot enter where He wills to be, you MUST be INTERFERING\nwith His Will. You do not need the strength of willingness to come from you, but\nonly from HIS Will.\n\nThe holy instant does NOT come from your little willingness alone. It\nis ALWAYS the result of your SMALL willingness COMBINED with the unlimited power\nof HIS Will. You have been wrong in thinking that it is\nneedful to prepare YOURSELF for Him. It is impossible to make arrogant\npreparations for holiness, and NOT believe that it is up to you to establish the\nconditions for peace. GOD HAS ESTABLISHED THEM. They do Not wait upon your\nwillingness for what they ARE. Your willingness is needed ONLY to make it\npossible to TEACH you what they are.\n\nIf you maintain you are unworthy of LEARNING this, you are INTERFERING\nwith the lesson by believing that you must make the LEARNER different. You did\nNOT make the learner, nor CAN you make him different. Would you FIRST make a\nmiracle yourself, and THEN expect one to be made FOR you? You merely ask the\nQUESTION. The answer is GIVEN. Seek not to ANSWER it, but merely RECEIVE the\nanswer AS it is given. In preparing for the holy instant, do NOT attempt to make\nyourself holy to be READY to receive it. That is but to confuse YOUR role with\nGod's. Atonement CANNOT come to those who think that THEY must first atone, but\nonly to those \nwho offer it NOTHING MORE than simple willingness to MAKE WAY for\nit.\n\nPurification is of God alone, and THEREFORE for you. Rather than seek\nto prepare YOURSELF for Him, try to think thus:\n\n“I who am host to God AM worthy of Him.\n\nHe Who ESTABLISHED His dwelling-place in me created it as He would have it\nbe.\n\nIt is not needful that I make it ready for Him, but only that I DO NOT\nINTERFERE with His plan to RESTORE to me my own awareness of my readiness,\nwhich is eternal.\n\nI need ADD nothing to His plan,\n\nBut to RECEIVE it, I must be willing NOT to\nsubstitute my own IN PLACE of it.”\n\nAnd that is all. Add MORE, and you will merely TAKE AWAY the little\nthat is asked. Remember YOU MADE GUILT, and that your plan for the ESCAPE from\nguilt has been to bring Atonement TO it, and MAKE SALVATION FEARFUL. And it is\nONLY fear that you will add, if you prepare YOURSELF for love. The preparation\nfor the holy instant belongs to Him Who gives it. RELEASE\nyourselves to Him Whose function IS release. Do NOT assume His function FOR Him.\nGive Him but what He asks, that you may learn how LITTLE is your part, and how\ngreat is HIS.\n\nIt is this that makes the holy instant so easy and so natural. You\nmake it difficult, because you insist there must be more that you need do. You\nfind it difficult to ACCEPT the idea that you need give so LITTLE, to receive so\nmuch. And it is very hard for you to realize that it is not personally insulting\nthat your contribution and the Holy Spirit's are so extremely disproportionate.\nYou are still convinced YOUR understanding is a powerful contribution to the\ntruth, and makes it what it is. Yet we have emphasized that you need understand\nnothing. Salvation is easy just BECAUSE it asks nothing that you cannot give\nRIGHT NOW.\n\nForget not that it has been your decision to make everything that IS\nnatural and easy for you impossible. What you believe to be impossible will BE,\nif God so wills it, but you will remain quite unaware of it. If you believe the\nholy instant is difficult for you, it is because you have become the arbiter of\nwhat is possible, and remain unwilling to give place to One Who KNOWS. The whole\nbelief in orders of difficulty in miracles is centered on this. Everything God",

    "content": "The Happy Dream\n\nPrepare you NOW for the undoing of what never was. If you already\nUNDERSTOOD the difference between truth and illusion, Atonement would HAVE no\nmeaning. The holy instant, your holy relationship, the Holy Spirit's teaching,\nand all the means by which salvation is accomplished, would have no purpose. For\nthey are all but ASPECTS of the plan to change your dreams of fear to happy\ndreams, from which you waken easily to knowledge. Put yourself NOT in charge of\nthis, for you can NOT distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your\ngreatest advances YOU have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats\nYOU have evaluated as success.\n\nNever approach the holy instant AFTER you have tried to remove all\nfear and hatred from your mind. That is ITS function. Never attempt to OVERLOOK\nyour guilt BEFORE you ask the Holy Spirit's help. That is HIS function. Your part\nis only to offer Him a LITTLE willingness to LET Him remove all fear and hatred,\nand to BE forgiven. On your little faith, joined with HIS understanding, HE will\nbuild your part in the Atonement, and MAKE SURE that you fulfill it easily. And\nWITH Him, YOU will build a ladder planted in the solid rock of faith, and rising\neven to Heaven. Nor will you use it to ascend to Heaven alone.\n\nThrough your holy relationship, reborn and blessed in every holy\ninstant which you did NOT arrange, thousands will rise to Heaven WITH you. Can\nYOU plan for THIS? Or could you PREPARE yourselves for such a function? Yet it IS\npossible, because God wills it. Nor will He change His Mind about it. The means\nand purpose BOTH belong to Him. You have accepted one; the other will be\nprovided. A purpose such as this, WITHOUT the means, IS inconceivable. HE will\nprovide the means to ANYONE who SHARES His purpose.\n\nHAPPY DREAMS COME TRUE, NOT because they are dreams, but only because\nthey are HAPPY. And so they MUST be loving. Their message is, ‘Thy Will be done,’\nand NOT, ‘I want it otherwise.’ The alignment of means and purpose is an\nundertaking IMPOSSIBLE for you to understand. You do not even realize you HAVE\naccepted the Holy Spirit's purpose as your own, and you would merely bring UNholy\nmeans to its accomplishment. The little faith it needed to change the purpose is\nall that is required to RECEIVE the means and USE them.\n\nIt is no dream to love your brother as yourself. Nor is your holy\nrelationship a dream. All that remains of dreams within it is that it is still a\nSPECIAL relationship. Yet it is VERY useful to the Holy Spirit, Who has a special\nFUNCTION here. It will become the HAPPY dream through which He can spread joy to\nthousands on thousands who believe that love is fear, NOT happiness. Let Him fulfill the function that He GAVE to your\nrelationship by ACCEPTING it FOR you. And NOTHING will be wanting that would make\nof it what HE would have it be.\n\nWhen you feel the holiness of your relationship is threatened by\nANYTHING, stop instantly and offer the Holy Spirit your willingness, IN SPITE of\nfear, to let Him exchange this instant for the holy one which YOU would rather\nhave. He will NEVER fail in this. But forget not that your relationship IS ONE,\nand so it MUST be that whatever threatens the peace of one is an equal threat to\nthe other. The power of joining, AND ITS BLESSING, lies in the fact that it is\nnow impossible for either of you to experience fear alone, or to attempt to DEAL\nwith it alone. Never believe that this is necessary, or even possible.\n\nBut, just as THIS is impossible, so is it equally impossible that the\nholy instant come to either of you WITHOUT the other. And it WILL come to both at\nthe REQUEST of either. Whichever is saner at the time when threat is perceived,\nshould remember how deep is his indebtedness to the other, and how much gratitude\nis due him. AND BE GLAD that he can pay his debt, by bringing happiness to both.\nLet him remember this, and say:\n“I desire this holy instant for myself\nThat I may SHARE it with my brother, whom I love.\nIt is not possible that I can have it WITHOUT him, nor he without me.\nYet it is WHOLLY possible for us to SHARE it NOW.\nAnd so I choose THIS instant as the one to offer to the Holy Spirit, That\nHis blessing may descend on us, and keep us BOTH in peace.”",

    "content": "Dreams and the Body\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE YOU. That is what you must ultimately learn,\nfor it is in that realization that the Kingdom of Heaven is restored to you. For\nGod created only this, and He did not depart from it, nor leave it separate from\nHimself. The Kingdom of Heaven is the dwelling place of the Son of God, who left\nnot his Father, and dwells not apart from Him. Heaven is not a place nor a\ncondition. It is merely an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that\nthere is nothing else. Nothing OUTSIDE THIS Oneness, and NOTHING ELSE within.\n\nWhat could God give, but knowledge of Himself? What else IS there to\ngive? The belief that you could give AND GET something, else, something OUTSIDE\nyourself, has cost you the awareness of Heaven, and the loss of knowledge of your\nidentity. And you have done a stranger thing than you yet realize. You have\ndisplaced your guilt to your bodies, FROM YOUR MINDS. Yet a body CANNOT be\nguilty, for it can do nothing of itself. You who think you hate your bodies,\ndeceive yourselves. YOU HATE YOUR MINDS, for guilt has entered into them, and\nthey would remain separate, which they CANNOT DO.\n\nMinds ARE joined; bodies are not. Only by assigning to the mind the\nproperties OF THE BODY, does separation SEEM to be possible. And it is MIND that\nseems to be fragmented and private and ALONE. Its guilt, which KEEPS it separate,\nis projected to the body, which suffers and dies, BECAUSE IT IS ATTACKED to hold\nthe separation in the mind, and let it NOT KNOW its unity. Mind cannot attack,\nbut it CAN make fantasies, and direct the body to act them out. But it is never\nwhat the BODY does that seems to satisfy. Unless the mind BELIEVES the body is\nACTUALLY acting out ITS fantasies, it\nwill attack the body by INCREASING the projection of its guilt upon it.\n\nIn this, the mind is CLEARLY delusional. It cannot attack, but\nmaintains it CAN, and USES what it does to hurt the body, to PROVE it can. The\nmind can not attack, but it CAN deceive itself. And this is ALL it does, when it\nbelieves it has attacked the body, It CAN project its guilt, but it will NOT lose\nit through projection. And though it clearly can MISPERCEIVE the function of the\nbody, it CANNOT change its function from what the Holy Spirit ESTABLISHES it to\nbe. The body was NOT made by love. But love does not condemn it, and can use it\nlovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made, and using it to SAVE him from\nillusions.\n\nWould you not have the instruments of separation RE-INTERPRETED as\nmeans for salvation, and USED for purposes of love? Would you not welcome AND\nSUPPORT the shift from fantasies of vengeance to release from them? Your\nPERCEPTION of the body can clearly be sick, but project this not upon the body.\nFor your wish to make destructive what CANNOT destroy, can have no REAL effect at\nall. And what God created is only what He would have it be, being His Will.\n\nYou cannot make His Will destructive. You can make FANTASIES, in which\nyour will CONFLICTS with His, but that is all. It is insane to use the body as\nthe scapegoat for guilt; DIRECTING its attack, and BLAMING it for what you wished\nit to do. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACT OUT FANTASIES. For it is still the FANTASIES\nyou want, and they have nothing to do with what the body does.\nIT does not dream of them, and they but make IT a liability, where it COULD be an\nasset. For fantasies have made your body your “enemy,” weak, vulnerable, and\ntreacherous, “worthy” of the hate which you invest in it.\n\nHow has this served you? You have IDENTIFIED with this thing you hate,\nthe instrument of vengeance, and the perceived source of your guilt. YOU have\ndone this to a thing that has no meaning, proclaiming it to be the dwelling place\nof the Son of God, and turning it AGAINST him. This is the host of God that YOU\nhave made. And neither God nor His most holy Son can enter an abode which harbors\nhate, and where you have sown the seeds of vengeance, violence, and death.\n\nThis thing you made to serve your guilt, stands between you and other\nminds. The minds ARE joined, but you do not IDENTIFY with them. You SEE yourself\nas locked in a separate prison, remote and unreachable, incapable of reaching out\nas being reached, You HATE the prison that you made, and would destroy it. Yet\nyou would NOT escape from it, leaving it unharmed, WITHOUT your guilt upon it.\nBut only thus CAN you escape. The home of vengeance is not yours; The place you\nset aside to house your hatred is NOT a prison, but an ILLUSION OF YOURSELF.\n\nThe body is a limit imposed on the universal communication which is an\neternal property of mind. But the communication is INTERNAL. Mind reaches to\nITSELF. It is NOT made up of different PARTS, which reach each other. It does not\ngo OUT. Within\nITSELF, it HAS no limits, and there is nothing OUTSIDE it. It encompasses\nEVERYTHING. It encompasses you ENTIRELY; you within it, and it within you. There\nIS nothing else, anywhere or ever. The body is OUTSIDE you, and SEEMS to surround\nyou, shutting you off from others, and keeping you APART from them, and them from\nyou.\n\nIT IS NOT THERE. There IS no barrier between God and His Son, nor can\nHis Son be separated from himself, except in illusion. This is NOT his reality,\nthough he believes it IS. Yet this could only BE, IF God were wrong. God would\nhave had to create DIFFERENTLY, and to have separated HIMSELF from His Son, to\nmake this possible. He would have had to create DIFFERENT things, and to\nestablish different ORDERS of reality, only SOME of which were love. Yet love\nmust be forever like itself, changeless forever, and forever WITHOUT alternative.\nAnd so it is.\n\nYOU cannot put a barrier around yourself, because God placed none\nbetween HIMSELF and you. Your hand can stretch out, and reach to Heaven. You\nwhose hands are joined have begun to reach BEYOND the body, but NOT outside\nyourselves. To reach your shared identity TOGETHER. Could this be OUTSIDE you?\nWhere God is not? Is He a body, and did He create you as He is not, and where He\nCANNOT be? You are surrounded ONLY by Him. What limits CAN there be on you, whom\nHE encompasses?\n\nEveryone has experienced what he would call a sense of being\ntransported BEYOND himself. This feeling of liberation FAR exceeds the DREAM of\nfreedom sometimes experienced in special relationships. It is a sense of actual\nESCAPE from limitations.\nIf you will consider what this “transportation” REALLY entails, you will realize\nthat it is a sudden UNawareness of the body, and a joining of your self and\nSOMETHING ELSE, in which your mind ENLARGES to encompass it. It becomes PART of\nyou, as you UNITE with it. And BOTH become whole, as NEITHER is perceived as\nseparate.\n\nWhat REALLY happens is that you have GIVEN UP the illusion of a\nLIMITED awareness, and lost your fear of union. The love that INSTANTLY replaces\nit EXTENDS to what has freed you, and UNITES you with it. And, while this lasts,\nyou are NOT uncertain of your identity, and would not limit it. You have escaped\nfrom fear to peace, asking no questions of reality, but merely ACCEPTING it. You\nhave accepted this INSTEAD of the body, and have LET yourself be ONE with\nsomething beyond it, simply by NOT letting your mind be limited BY it.\n\nThis can occur REGARDLESS of the physical distance that SEEMS to be\nbetween you and what you join; of your respective positions in space; and of your\ndifferences in size and seeming quality. Time is not relevant; it can occur with\nsomething past, present, or anticipated. The “something” can be anything and\nANYWHERE; a sound, a sight, a thought, a memory, even a more GENERAL idea,\nWITHOUT specific reference. But, in every case, you join it without RESERVATION,\nbecause you love it, and would BE with it. And so you rush to meet it, letting\nyour limits melt away, suspending ALL the “laws” your body obeys, and gently\nSETTING THEM ASIDE.\n\nThere is no violence at all in this escape. The body is NOT attacked,\nbut merely PROPERLY PERCEIVED. It does not limit you, merely because YOU would\nnot have it so. You are not really “lifted out” of it; it cannot CONTAIN you. You\ngo where you would be; GAINING, NOT losing, a sense of self. In these instants of\nrelease from physical restrictions, you experience much of what happens in the\nholy instant; the lifting of the barriers of time and space, the sudden\nexperience of peace and joy, and, above all, the LACK of awareness of the body,\nand of the questioning WHETHER OR NOT ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE. It IS possible,\nBECAUSE YOU WANT IT.\n\nThe sudden EXPANSION of the self that takes place with your DESIRE for\nit, is the irresistible appeal the holy instant holds. It calls to you to be\nyourself, within its safe embrace. There are the laws of limit lifted FOR you, to\nwelcome you to openness of mind, and freedom. Come to this place of refuge, where\nyou can be yourself in peace. NOT through destruction, NOT through a “breaking\nout,” but merely by a quiet “melting in.” For peace will join you there, simply\nbecause YOU have been willing to let go the limits YOU have placed on love, and\nJOINED it where it is, and where it led you, in answer to its gentle call to be\nat peace.",

    "content": "\"I Need Do Nothing\"\n\nYou still have too much faith in the body as a source of strength.\nWhat plans do you make that do NOT involve its comfort or protection or enjoyment\nin some way? This makes it an end and not a means in your interpretation, and\nthis ALWAYS means YOU STILL FIND SIN ATTRACTIVE. No-on accepts Atonement for\nhimself who still accepts sin as his goal. You have thus not met your one\nresponsibility. Atonement is not welcomed by those who PREFER pain and\ndestruction.\n\nYou have made much progress, and are really trying to make still more,\nbut there is one thing you have never done; not for one instant have you utterly\nforgotten the body. It has faded at times from your sight, but it has not yet\nCOMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. You are not asked to let this happen for more than an\ninstant, but it is in this instant that the miracle of Atonement happens.\nAfterwards, you will see the body again, but never quite the same. And every\ninstant that you spend WITHOUT awareness of it gives you a different view of it,\nwhen you return.\n\nAt no SINGLE instant does the body exist at all. It is always\nremembered or anticipated, but NEVER experienced just now. Only its past and\nfuture make it seem real. Time controls it entirely. For sin is never present. In\nany SINGLE instant, the attraction of guilt would be experienced as pain and\nnothing else, and would be avoided. IT HAS NO ATTRACTION NOW. Its whole\nattraction is imaginary, and therefore MUST be thought of from the past, or in\nthe future.\n\nIt is impossible to accept the holy instant WITHOUT RESERVATION\nunless, JUST FOR AN INSTANT, you are willing to see no past or future. You cannot\nPREPARE for it without placing it in the FUTURE. Release is given you the INSTANT\nyou desire it. Many have spent a lifetime in preparation, and have, indeed,\nachieved their instants of success. This course does not attempt to teach more\nthan they learned in time. But it does aim at SAVING time.\n\nYou are attempting to follow a very long road to the goal you have\naccepted. It is extremely difficult to reach Atonement by fighting against sin.\nEnormous effort is expended in the attempt to make holy what is hated and\ndespised. Nor is a lifetime of contemplation, and long periods of meditation\naimed at DETACHMENT from the body necessary. All such attempts will ultimately\nsucceed, because of their purpose. But the means are tedious and very time\nconsuming, for all of them LOOK TO THE FUTURE for release from a state of present\nunworthiness and inadequacy.\n\nYour way will be different. NOT in purpose, but in means. A HOLY\nRELATIONSHIP IS A MEANS OF SAVING TIME. One instant spent TOGETHER restores the\nuniverse to BOTH of you. You ARE prepared. Now you need but remember YOU NEED DO\nNOTHING. It would be FAR more profitable now merely to concentrate on this, than\nto consider what you SHOULD do.\n\nWhen peace comes at last to those who wrestle with temptation, and\nfight against giving in to sin; when the light comes at last into the mind given\nto contemplation, or when the goal is finally achieved by anyone, it ALWAYS comes\nwith just ONE happy realization, -- “I need do nothing.” Here is the ultimate\nrelease that everyone will one day find in his own way, at his own time. We do\nnot need this time. Time has been SAVED for you, because you are together. This\nis the special means this course is using, to save you time.\n\nYou are not making use of the course if you insist on using means that\nhave served others well, neglecting what was made for YOU. Save time for me by\nonly this one preparation, and practice doing NOTHING ELSE. “I need do nothing”\nis a statement of allegiance, a truly undivided loyalty. Believe it for just one\ninstant, and you will accomplish more than is given to a century of\ncontemplation, or of struggle against temptation.\n\nTo DO anything involves the body. And, if you recognize you NEED do\nnothing, you HAVE withdrawn the body's value from your mind. Here is the quick\nand open door through which you slip past centuries of effort, and ESCAPE from\ntime. This is the way in which sin loses ALL attraction RIGHT NOW. For here is\ntime denied, and past and future gone. Who need do nothing has no need for time.\nTo do nothing is to rest, and make a place within you where the activity of the\nbody ceases to demand attention. Into this place the Holy Spirit comes, and there\nabides.\n\nHe will remain when you forget, and the body's activities return to\noccupy your conscious mind. But there will always be this place of rest, to which\nyou can return. And you will be more aware of the quiet center of the storm, than\nall its raging activity. This quiet center, IN WHICH YOU DO NOTHING, will remain\nwith you, giving you rest in the midst of every busy doing on which you are sent.",

    "content": "The Purpose of the Body\n\nIt is only the awareness of the body that makes love seem limited. For\nthe body IS a limit on love. The belief in limited love was its origin, and it\nwas MADE to limit the UNlimited. Think not that this is merely allegorical; for\nit was made to limit YOU. Can you who see yourselves WITHIN a body, know yourself\nAS AN IDEA? Everything you recognize you identify by EXTERNALS, something OUTSIDE\nitself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or some form you think you\nrecognize. The body cannot KNOW. And while you limit your awareness to its tiny\nsenses, you will not see the grandeur that surrounds you.\n\nGod cannot come into a body, nor can you join Him there. Limits on\nlove will ALWAYS seem to shut Him out, and to keep you APART from Him. The body\nis a tiny fence around a little part of a glorious and completely limitless idea.\nIt draws a circle, infinitely small, around a very little segment of Heaven,\nsplintered from the whole, proclaiming that, within it, is YOUR Kingdom, where\nGod can enter not. Within this kingdom the ego rules, and cruelly. And, to defend\nthis little speck of dust, it bids you fight against the universe.\n\nThis fragment of your mind is such a tiny part of it that, could you\nbut appreciate the whole, you would see instantly that it is like the smallest\nsunbeam is to the sun. Or like the faintest ripple on the surface of the ocean.\nIn its amazing arrogance, this tiny sunbeam has decided it IS the sun; this\nalmost imperceptible ripple hails itself as the ocean. Think how alone and\nfrightened is this little thought, this infinitesimal illusion, holding itself\napart, against the universe. The sun becomes the sunbeam's “enemy,” which would\ndevour it. And the ocean terrifies the little ripple, and “wants” to swallow it.\n\nYet neither sun nor ocean is even aware of all this strange and\nmeaningless activity. They merely continue, unaware that they are feared and\nhated by a tiny segment of themselves. Even that segment is not LOST to them, for\nit could not survive APART from them And what IT thinks it is in no way changes\nits total dependence on them FOR ITS BEING. Its whole existence still remains IN\nTHEM. Without the sun, the sunbeam WOULD be gone; the ripple WITHOUT the ocean IS\ninconceivable.\n\nSuch is the strange position in which those in a world inhabited by\nbodies seem to be. Each body seems to house a SEPARATE mind, a DISCONNECTED\nthought, living alone and in no way joined to the Thought by which it was\ncreated. Each tiny fragment seems to be self-contained, needing each other for\nSOME things, but by no means TOTALLY dependent on their One Creator for\nEVERYTHING. And needing the whole to give them ANY meaning, for by themselves,\nthey DO mean nothing. Nor HAVE they any life apart, and by themselves.\n\nYet, like the sun and ocean, your Self continues, unmindful that this\ntiny part regards ITSELF as you. It is not missing; it could not EXIST if it were\nseparate, nor would the whole BE whole without it. It is not a separate kingdom,\nruled by an IDEA of separation from the rest. Nor does a fence surround it,\npreventing it from JOINING with the rest, and keeping it apart from its Creator.\nThis little aspect is NO DIFFERENT from the whole, being continuous with it, and\nat one with it. It leads no separate life, because its life IS in the Oneness in\nwhich its being was created.\n\nDo not accept this little, fenced-off aspect as your Self. The sun and\nocean are as nothing, beside what YOU are. The sunbeam sparkles only in the\nsunlight, and the ripple dances as it rests upon the ocean. Yet in neither sun\nnor ocean is the power that rests in you. Would you remain WITHIN your tiny\nkingdom, a sorry king, a bitter ruler of all he surveys, who\nlooks on nothing, but who would still die to DEFEND it? This little self is NOT\nyour kingdom. Arched high above it, and surrounding it, with love, is the\nglorious whole, which offers all its happiness and deep content to EVERY part.\n\nThe little aspect that you think you set apart is no exception. Love\nknows no bodies, and reaches to everything created like itself. Its total lack of\nlimit IS its meaning. It is COMPLETELY impartial in its giving, encompassing ONLY\nto preserve and KEEP COMPLETE what it would give. In your tiny kingdom you have\nso little! Should it not, then, be there that you would call on love to enter?\nLook at the desert, dry and unproductive, scorched and joyless, that makes up\nyour little kingdom. And realize the life and joy that love would bring to it,\nfrom where IT comes, and where it would return WITH you.\n\nThe Thought of God surrounds your little kingdom, waiting at the\nbarrier you built, to come in and shine upon the barren ground. See how life\nsprings up everywhere! The desert becomes a garden, green and deep and quiet,\noffering rest to those who lost their way, and wander in the dust. Give them a\nplace of refuge, prepared by love for them, where once a desert was. And every\none you welcome will bring love with him, from Heaven for you. They enter one by\none into this holy place, but they will not depart as they had come, alone.\n\nThe love they BROUGHT with them will STAY with them, as it will stay\nwith YOU. And, under its beneficence, your little garden will expand, and reach\nout to everyone who thirsts for living water, but has grown too weary to go on\nalone. Go out and FIND them, for they bring your Self with them. And lead them\ngently to your quiet garden, and receive their blessing there. So will it grow,\nand stretch across the desert, leaving no lonely little kingdoms locked away from\nlove, and leaving YOU outside.\nAnd you will RECOGNIZE yourself, and see your little garden gently transformed\ninto the Kingdom of Heaven, with all the love of its Creator shining upon it.\n\nThe holy instant is your invitation to love, to enter into your bleak\nand joyless kingdom, and transform it into a garden of peace and welcome. Love's\nanswer is inevitable. It will come, because you came WITHOUT the body, and\ninterposed no barriers which would INTERFERE with its glad coming. In the holy\ninstant, you ask of love only what it offers everyone, neither less nor more.\nAsking for EVERYTHING, you will RECEIVE it. And your shining Self will lift the\ntiny aspect that you tried to hide from Heaven, straight into Heaven. No part of\nlove calls on the whole in vain. No son of God remains OUTSIDE His Fatherhood.\n\nBe sure of this; love has entered your special relationship, and\nentered fully, at your weak request. You do NOT recognize that love has come,\nbecause you have not yet let go of ALL the barriers you hold against EACH OTHER.\nAnd you will NOT be able to give love welcome separately. You could no more know\nGod alone, than He knows you without your brother. But, TOGETHER, you could no\nmore be UNAWARE of love, than love could know you not, or fail to recognize\nITSELF in you.\n\nYou have reached the end of an ancient journey not realizing yet that\nit is over. You are still worn and tired, and the desert's dust still seems to\ncloud your eyes, and keep you sightless. Yet He Whom you welcomed has come to\nyou, and would welcome YOU. He has waited long to give you this. Receive it now",

    "content": "The Delusional Thought System\n\nYou have been told to bring the darkness to the light, and guilt to\nholiness. And you have also been told that error must be corrected at its source.\nTherefore, it is the tiny part of your self, the little thought that seems split\noff and separate, that the Holy Spirit needs. The rest is fully in God's keeping,\nand needs no guide. But this wild and delusional thought needs help, because, in\nits delusions, it thinks it is the Son of God, whole and omnipotent, sole ruler\nof the kingdom it set apart, to tyrannize by madness into obedience and slavery.\n\nThis is the LITTLE part of you, you think you stole from Heaven. Give\nit back to Heaven. Heaven has not lost it, but YOU have lost sight of Heaven. Let\nthe Holy Spirit remove it from the withered kingdom in which you set it up,\nsurrounded by darkness, guarded by attack, and reinforced by hate. Within its\nbarricades is still a tiny segment of the Son of God, complete and holy, serene\nand unaware of what you think surrounds it. Be you not separate, for the One Who\nDOES surround it has brought union to you, returning your little offering of\ndarkness to the Eternal Light.\nFeb. , 1967\n\nHow is this done? It is extremely simple, being based on what this\nlittle kingdom really IS. The barren sands, the darkness, and the lifelessness\nare seen only through the body's eyes. ITS vision IS distorted, and the messages\nIT transmits to you, who MADE it to limit your awareness, ARE little and limited,\nso fragmented that they are meaningless. From the world of bodies, MADE by\ninsanity, insane messages seem to be returned to the mind which made it. And\nthese messages bear witness to this world, pronouncing it as true. For YOU sent\nforth these messengers, to bring this BACK to you.\n\nEverything these messages relay to you is quite external. There are NO\nmessages that speak of what lies underneath, for it is NOT the body that could\nspeak of this. Its eyes perceive it not, its senses remain quite UNAWARE of it,\nits tongue can not relay ITS messages. Yet God can bring you there, if you are\nwilling to follow the Holy Spirit through seeming terror, trusting Him not to\nabandon you, and LEAVE you there. For it is not HIS purpose to frighten you, but\nonly YOURS. YOU are severely tempted to abandon HIM at the outside ring of fear.\nBut HE would lead you safely through, and FAR beyond.\n\nThe circle of fear lies just below the level the body sees, and SEEMS\nto be the whole foundation on which the world is based. Here are all the\nillusions, all the twisted thoughts, all the insane attacks, the fury, vengeance,\nand betrayal that were made to keep the guilt in place, so that the world could\nRISE from it, and keep IT hidden. Its SHADOW rises to the surface, enough to hold\nits most external manifestations in darkness, and to bring despair and\nloneliness to it, and keep it joyless. But its INTENSITY is veiled by its heavy\ncoverings, and kept APART from what was made to keep it hidden.\n\nThe body cannot see this, for the body AROSE from this for its\nprotection, which must ALWAYS depend on keeping it NOT seen. The body's eyes will\nNEVER look on it. Yet they will SEE what it dictates. The body will remain\nguilt's messenger, and will act as it directs, as long as YOU believe that guilt\nis real. For the REALITY of guilt is the illusion which seems to make it heavy\nand opaque, impenetrable, and a REAL foundation for the ego's thought system. Its\nthinness and transparency are not apparent, until you see the light BEHIND it.\nAnd then you see it as a fragile veil, before the light.\n\nThis heavy-seeming barrier, this artificial floor that looks like\nrock, is like a bank of low, dark clouds that seem to be a solid wall before the\nsun. Its impenetrable appearance is WHOLLY an illusion. It gives way softly to\nthe mountain tops that rise above it, and has no power at all to hold back anyone\nwilling to climb above it, to see the sun. It is not strong enough to stop a\nbutton's fall, nor hold a feather. Nothing can rest upon it, for it is but an\nILLUSION of a foundation. Try but to touch it, and it disappears; attempt to\ngrasp it, and your hands hold nothing.\n\nYet in this cloud bank it is easy to see a whole world rising. A solid\nmountain range, a lake, a city, all arise in your imagination, and FROM the\nclouds, the messengers of your perception return to you, assuring you that it is\nall THERE. Figures stand out and move about, actions seem real, and forms appear\nand shift from loveliness to the grotesque. And back and forth they go, as long\nas you would play the game of children's “make believe.” Yet, however long you\nplay it, and regardless of how much imagination you bring to it, you do NOT\nconfuse it with the world below, nor seek to make it real.\n\nSo should it be with the dark clouds of guilt, no more impenetrable\nand no more substantial. You will NOT bruise yourself against them, in traveling\nthrough. Let your Guide TEACH you their UNsubstantial nature, as He leads you\nPAST them. For BENEATH them is a world of light, whereon they cast no shadows.\nTheir shadows lie upon the world BEYOND them, still FURTHER from the light. But\nfrom them TO the light, their shadows CANNOT fall. This world of light, this\ncircle of brightness, is the real world, where guilt meets with forgiveness.\nHere, the world OUTSIDE is seen anew, WITHOUT the shadow of guilt upon it.\n\nHere are YOU forgiven, for here you have forgiven everyone. Here is\nthe new perception, where everything is bright and shining with innocence, washed\nin the waters of forgiveness, and cleansed of every evil thought you laid upon\nit. Here there is no attack upon the Son of God, and YOU are welcome. Here is\nyour innocence, waiting to clothe you and protect you, and make you ready for the\nfinal step in the journey inward. Here are the dark and heavy garments of guilt\nlaid by, and gently replaced by purity and joy.\n\nYet even forgiveness is not the end. Forgiveness DOES make lovely, but\nit does NOT create. It IS the source of healing, but it is the MESSENGER of love,\nand not its Source. Here you are led, that God Himself can take the final step\nunhindered. For here does nothing INTERFERE with love, letting it be Itself. A\nstep BEYOND this holy place of forgiveness. A step still further inward, but one\nyou CANNOT take, transports you to something COMPLETELY different. Here is the\nSource of light; nothing perceived, forgiven, nor transformed. But merely KNOWN.",

Nor is there any need for us to try to speak\nof what must forever lie beyond words.

Where learning ends, there God begins, for learning\nends before Him Who is complete where He begins, and where there IS no end.\n\nIt is not for us to dwell on what cannot BE attained. There is too\nmuch to learn. The readiness for knowledge still must be attained. Love is not\nlearned. Its meaning lies in Itself. And learning ends when you have recognized\nall it is NOT. That is the INTERFERENCE; that is what needs to be undone. Love is\nnot learned, because there never WAS a time in which you knew it not. Learning is\nuseless in the Presence of your Creator, Whose ACKNOWLEDGMENT of you, AND YOURS\nOF HIM, so FAR transcends ALL learning, that EVERYTHING you learned is\nmeaningless, replaced forever by the knowledge of love and its One meaning.\n\nYour relationship has been uprooted from the world of shadows, and its\nunholy purpose has been safely brought through the barriers of guilt, washed with\nforgiveness, and set shining and firmly rooted in the world of light.

    "content": "Healing and the Mind\n\nThe body cannot heal, because it cannot MAKE ITSELF SICK. It NEEDS no\nhealing. Its health or sickness depends ENTIRELY on how the mind perceives it,\nand the purpose which the mind would use it FOR. And it IS obvious that a segment\nof the mind CAN see itself as SEPARATED from the Universal Purpose. When this\noccurs, the body becomes its weapon, used AGAINST this Purpose, to DEMONSTRATE\nthe “fact” that separation HAS occurred. The body thus becomes the instrument of\nillusion, acting accordingly, SEEING what is not there, HEARING what truth has\nnever said, and BEHAVING INSANELY, being imprisoned BY insanity.\n\nDo not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads\nstraight to illusions. For faithlessness IS the perception of a brother AS a\nbody, and the body CANNOT be used for purposes of union. If, then, you SEE him as\na body, YOU have established a condition in which UNITING with him becomes\nimpossible. Your FAITHLESSNESS to him has separated you from him, and kept you\nBOTH apart from being healed. Your faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy\nSpirit's purpose, and brought illusions, CENTERED ON THE BODY, to stand BETWEEN\nyou. And the body WILL seem to be sick, for you have made of it an “enemy” of\nhealing, and the OPPOSITE of truth.\n\nIt CANNOT be difficult to realize that faith MUST be the opposite of\nfaithLESSness. But the difference in how they operate is less apparent, though it\nfollows directly from the fundamental difference in what they ARE. Faithlessness\nwould always LIMIT AND ATTACK; faith would remove ALL limitations, and MAKE\nWHOLE. Faithlessness would destroy and SEPARATE; faith would unite and HEAL.\nFaithlessness would interpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator;\nfaith would remove ALL obstacles that SEEM to rise between them. Faithlessness is\nwholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to truth.\n\nPARTIAL DEDICATION IS IMPOSSIBLE. Truth is the ABSENCE of illusion;\nillusion the ABSENCE of truth. Both cannot BE together, nor perceived in the SAME\nPLACE. To dedicate yourself to BOTH, is to set up a goal forever impossible to\nattain. For PART of it is sought through the body, THOUGHT OF as a means for\nseeking out reality through ATTACK. While the OTHER part would HEAL, and\ntherefore calls upon the mind, and NOT the body. The INEVITABLE compromise is the\nbelief that the BODY must be healed, and NOT the mind. For this divided goal has\ngiven both an EQUAL reality, and can SEEM to be possible only if the mind is\nlimited TO the body, and divided into little parts with SEEMING wholeness, but\nWITHOUT CONNECTION.\n\nThis will NOT harm the body. But it WILL keep the delusional thoughtsystem\nIN THE MIND. Here, then, is healing needed. And it is here that healing\nIS. For God gave healing not APART from sickness, nor established remedy where\nsickness CANNOT be. They ARE together, and when they are SEEN together, ALL\nattempts to KEEP both truth AND illusion in the mind, where both MUST be, are\nrecognized as DEDICATION TO ILLUSION. And GIVEN UP when BROUGHT to truth, and\nseen as totally UNRECONCILABLE with truth, in ANY aspect, or in any WAY.\n\nTruth and illusion HAVE no connection. This will remain FOREVER true,\nhowever much YOU seek to connect them. But ILLUSIONS are ALWAYS connected, AS IS\nTRUTH. Each is united, a COMPLETE thought-system, but totally DISconnected to\nEACH OTHER. Where there is NO overlap, there separation MUST be complete. And to\nperceive THIS is to recognize where separation IS, and WHERE IT MUST BE HEALED.\nThe RESULT of an idea is NEVER separate from its source. The IDEA of separation\nPRODUCED the body, and remains connected TO it, MAKING it sick because of its\nidentification WITH it.\n\nYou THINK you are PROTECTING the body by HIDING this connection. For\nthis concealment SEEMS to keep your identification safe from the “attack” of\ntruth. If you but understood how much this strange concealment has hurt your\nmind, and how confused your own identification has become to you, BECAUSE of it!\nYou do NOT see how great the devastation wrought by your faithlessness. For\nfaithlessness IS an attack, which SEEMS to be justified BY ITS RESULTS. For, by\nWITHHOLDING faith, you SEE what IS unworthy of it, and CANNOT look beyond the\nbarrier to what is joined with YOU.\n\nTo have faith is to heal. It is the sign that you HAVE accepted the\nAtonement for yourself, and would therefore share it. By faith, you OFFER the\ngift of freedom from the past, which you have RECEIVED. You do NOT use ANYTHING\nyour brother has done before, to condemn him NOW. You freely choose to OVERLOOK\nhis errors, looking PAST all barriers between your self and his, and seeing them\nAS ONE. And in that One, you see your faith is FULLY justified. There IS no\njustification for faithlessness. But faith is ALWAYS justified.\n\nFaith is the OPPOSITE of fear, as much a part of love, as fear is of\nattack. Faith is the acknowledgment of UNION. It is the gracious acknowledgment\nof everyone as a Son of your most loving Father, loved by Him like you. And\ntherefore loved by you as yourself. It is HIS Love that joins you, and FOR His\nLove, you would keep no-one separate from YOURS. Each one APPEARS just as he is\nperceived in the holy instant, united in YOUR purpose to be RELEASED from guilt.\nYou saw the Christ in him, and he was healed, because you looked on what makes\nfaith FOREVER justified in EVERYONE.\n\nFaith is the gift of God, through Him Whom God has GIVEN you.\nFaithlessness looks upon the Son of God, and judges him UNWORTHY of forgiveness.\nBut, through the eyes of faith, the Son of God is seen ALREADY forgiven, free of\nall the guilt he laid upon himself. Faith sees him only NOW, because it looks not\nto the past to judge him, but would see in him ONLY what it would see in YOU. It\nsees NOT through the body's eyes, nor looks to bodies for its justification. It\nis the messenger of the NEW perception, sent forth to gather witnesses unto its\ncoming, and to return their messages to YOU.\n\nFaith is as easily exchanged for knowledge as is the real world. For\nfaith ARISES from the Holy Spirit's perception, and is the sign you share it WITH\nHim. Faith is a gift you offer to the Son of God THROUGH Him, and WHOLLY\nacceptable to his Father as to him. And therefore offered YOU. Your holy\nrelationship, with its NEW purpose, offers you faith to give unto EACH OTHER.\nYour faithlessness had driven you APART, and so you did not RECOGNIZE salvation\nin each other. But faith UNITES you in the holiness you see, NOT through the\nbody's eyes, but in the sight of Him Who joined you, and in Whom YOU are united.\n\nGrace is not given to a BODY, but to a MIND. And the mind that\nRECEIVES it, looks INSTANTLY beyond the body, and sees the holy place where IT\nwas healed. THERE is the altar where the grace was given, in which IT stands. Do\nyou, then, offer grace and BLESSING to each other, for you stand at the SAME\naltar, where grace was laid for BOTH of you. And be you healed by grace TOGETHER,\nthat YOU may heal through faith.\n\nIn the holy instant, you stand before the altar God has raised unto\nHimself and BOTH of you. Lay faithlessness aside, and come to it TOGETHER. There\nwill you see the miracle of your relationship, as it was MADE AGAIN through\nfaith. And there it is that you will realize that there is NOTHING faith can NOT\nforgive. NO error INTERFERES with its calm sight, which brings the miracle of\nhealing with equal ease to ALL of them. For what the messengers of love are sent\nto do THEY DO. Returning the glad tidings that it was done, to you who stand\nbefore the altar from which they were sent forth, TOGETHER.\n\nAs faithlessness will keep your little kingdoms barren and separate,\nso will faith help the Holy Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy garden\nthat He would make of it. For faith brings peace, and so it calls on truth to\nenter and make lovely, what has already BEEN prepared for loveliness. Truth\nFOLLOWS faith and peace, completing the process of making lovely that they begin.\nFor faith is still a learning goal, no longer needed when the lesson has been\nlearned. \\*But Truth will stay forever.\n\nLet, then, your dedication be to the eternal. And learn how NOT to\ninterfere with it, and make it slave to time. For what you think you do to the\neternal, you do to YOU. Whom God created as His Son is slave to nothing, being\nlord of all, along with his Creator. You CAN enslave a body, but an IDEA is free,\nINCAPABLE of being kept in prison, or limited in ANY way,\nEXCEPT BY THE MIND THAT THOUGHT IT. For it remains JOINED to its source, which is\nits jailor or its liberator, according to which it chooses as ITS purpose FOR\nITSELF.",

    "content": "Sin versus Error\n\nIt is ESSENTIAL that error be not confused with “sin.” And it is this\ndistinction which makes salvation possible. For error can be corrected, and the\nwrong made right. But sin, were it possible, WOULD be irreversible. The belief in\nsin is necessarily based on the firm conviction that minds, NOT bodies, can\nattack. And thus the mind IS guilty, and will forever so remain, unless a mind\nNOT part of it can give it absolution. Sin calls for punishment, as error for\ncorrection. And the belief that punishment IS correction, is clearly insane.\n\nSin is not error. For sin entails an arrogance which the idea of error\nlacks. To sin would be to violate reality, AND TO SUCCEED. Sin is the\nproclamation that attack is real, and guilt is JUSTIFIED. It assumes the Son of\nGod IS guilty, and has thus SUCCEEDED in losing his innocence, and making of\nhimself what God created NOT. Thus is creation seen as NOT eternal, and the Will\nof God open to opposition AND DEFEAT. Sin is the “grand illusion” underlying ALL\nthe ego's grandiosity. For BY it, God HIMSELF is changed, and rendered\nincomplete.\n\nThe Son of God CAN be mistaken; he CAN deceive himself; he can even\nturn the power of his mind AGAINST himself. But he can NOT sin. There is NOTHING\nhe can do that would REALLY change his reality in ANY way, nor make him REALLY\nguilty. That is what sin WOULD do, for such is its PURPOSE. Yet, for all the wild\ninsanity inherent in the whole IDEA of sin, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. For the wages of\nsin IS death, and how can the immortal die?\n\nA MAJOR tenet in the ego's insane religion is that sin is NOT error,\nbut TRUTH. And it is INNOCENCE that would deceive. PURITY is seen as arrogance,\nand the acceptance of the self AS SINFUL is perceived as holiness. And it is this\ndoctrine that REPLACES the reality of the Son of God, as his Father created him,\nand willed that he be forever. Is this HUMILITY? Or is it rather an attempt to\nwrest creation AWAY from truth, and keep it separate?\n\nANY attempt to re-interpret sin as error is wholly indefensible to the\nego. The IDEA of sin is WHOLLY sacrosanct in its thought-system, and quite\nunapproachable except through reverence and awe. It is the most “holy” concept in\nthe ego's system; lovely and powerful, wholly true, and NECESSARILY protected\nwith every defense at its disposal. For here lies its “best” defense, which all\nthe others serve. Here is its armor, its protection, and the fundamental PURPOSE\nof the special relationship, in its interpretation.\n\nIt can indeed be said the ego MADE its world on sin. Only in such a\nworld COULD everything be upside-down. This IS the strange illusion which makes\nthe clouds of guilt seem heavy and impenetrable. The solidness this world's\nfoundation SEEMS to have is FOUND in this. For sin HAS changed creation from an\nIdea of God to an IDEAL the EGO wants; a world IT rules, made up of bodies,\nmindless, and capable of COMPLETE corruption and decay.\n\nIf this is a MISTAKE, it can be undone easily by truth. ANY mistake\ncan be corrected, if TRUTH be left to judge it. But, if the mistake is given the\nSTATUS of truth, to what CAN it be brought? The “holiness” of sin is kept in\nplace by just this strange device. As TRUTH, it IS inviolate, and everything is\nbrought to IT for judgment. As a MISTAKE, IT must be brought to truth. It is\nimpossible to have faith in sin, for sin IS faithlessness. But it IS possible to\nhave faith that a MISTAKE can be corrected.\n\nThere is no stone in all the ego's embattled citadel more heavily\ndefended than the idea that sin is real; the NATURAL expression of what the Son\nof God has MADE himself to be, AND WHAT HE IS. To the ego, THIS IS NO MISTAKE.\nFor this IS its reality; this is the “truth,” from which escape will ALWAYS be\nimpossible. This is his past, his present, and his future. For he has somehow\nmanaged to corrupt his Father, and change His Mind COMPLETELY. Mourn then the\ndeath of God, Whom sin has killed!\n\nAnd this WOULD be the ego's wish, which, in its madness, it thinks it\nhas ACCOMPLISHED. Would you not RATHER that all this be nothing more than a\nMISTAKE, ENTIRELY correctable, and so easily escaped from that its whole\ncorrection is like walking through a mist into the sun? For that is all it IS.\nPerhaps you would be tempted to AGREE with the ego, that it is far better to be\nsinful than mistaken. But think you carefully before you allow yourself to make\nthis choice. Approach it not lightly, for it IS the choice of hell or Heaven.",

    "content": "The Unreality of Sin\n\nThe attraction of guilt is found in sin, NOT error. Sin will be\nrepeated, BECAUSE of this attraction. Fear can become so acute that the sin is\ndenied the acting out, but, while the guilt REMAINS attractive, the mind will\nsuffer, and not let go the IDEA of the sin. For guilt still calls to it, and the\nmind hears it and yearns for it, making it a willing captive to its sick appeal.\nSin is an idea of evil that cannot BE corrected, and will be forever DESIRABLE.\nAs an ESSENTIAL part of what the ego thinks you ARE, you will ALWAYS want it. And\nonly an AVENGER, with a mind UNLIKE your own, could stamp it out through FEAR.\n\nThe ego does not think it possible that love, NOT fear, is really\ncalled upon by sin, AND ALWAYS ANSWERS. For the ego brings sin to FEAR, demanding\npunishment. But punishment is but another form of guilt's protection. For what is\nDESERVING punishment, must have been REALLY DONE. Punishment is always the great\npreserver of sin; treating it with respect, and honoring its enormity. What must\nbe punished, MUST BE TRUE. And what is true MUST be eternal, and WILL be\nrepeated endlessly. For what you think is real YOU WANT, and will NOT let it go.\n\nAn ERROR, on the other hand, is NOT attractive. What you see clearly\nAS A MISTAKE, you WANT corrected. Sometimes a sin can be repeated over and over,\nwith OBVIOUSLY distressing results, but WITHOUT the loss of its appeal. And\nsuddenly you change its status from a sin to a MISTAKE. Now you will NOT repeat\nit; you will merely stop, and let it go. UNLESS THE GUILT REMAINS. For then, you\nwill but change the FORM of sin, granting that it was an error, but KEEPING IT\nUNCORRECTABLE. This is not really a change in your perception, for it is SIN that\ncalls for punishment, NOT error.\n\nThe Holy Spirit CANNOT punish sin. Mistakes He recognizes, and would\ncorrect them all, as God entrusted Him to do. But SIN He knows not, nor can He\nRECOGNIZE mistakes that cannot be corrected. For a mistake that cannot be\ncorrected is MEANINGLESS to Him. Mistakes are FOR correction. They call for\nNOTHING ELSE. What calls for punishment, must call for NOTHING. Yet every mistake\nMUST be a call for love. What, then, is sin? What COULD it be but a mistake you\nwould keep hidden; a call for help that you would keep UNHEARD, and thus\nUNANSWERED?\n\nIn time, the Holy Spirit CLEARLY sees the Son of God can make\nmistakes. On this, you SHARE His vision. Yet you do NOT share His recognition of\nthe difference between time and eternity. And when correction is completed, time\nIS eternity. Time is like a downward spiral, that seems to travel down from a\nlong, unbroken line, along another plane, but which in no way BREAKS the line, or\ninterferes with its smooth continuousness. Along the spiral, it SEEMS as if the\nline MUST have been broken, but, at the LINE, its wholeness is apparent.\n\nEverything seen from the spiral is misperceived. But, as you approach\nthe line, you realize that IT was not affected by the drop into another plane at\nall. But, FROM this plane, the LINE seems discontinuous. And this is but an error\nin perception, which can be easily corrected IN THE MIND, although the body's\neyes will see no change. The eyes see many things the mind corrects, and YOU\nrespond, NOT to the eyes' illusions, BUT TO THE MIND'S CORRECTIONS. You SEE the\nline as broken, and as you shift to different aspects of the spiral, the line\nlooks different. Yet in your mind is One Who KNOWS it is unbroken, and forever\nchangeless.\n\nThis One can teach you how to look on time differently, and to see\nBEYOND it. But NOT while you believe in sin. In error, yes, for this CAN be\ncorrected by the mind. But sin is the belief that YOUR perception is\nUNCHANGEABLE, and that the MIND must ACCEPT AS TRUE what it is told THROUGH it.\nIf it does not obey, the MIND is judged insane. The ONLY power that could CHANGE\nperception is thus kept impotent, held to the body by the FEAR of changed\nperception, which its Teacher, Who is One with it, would bring.\n\nT 19 D 8. When you are tempted to believe that sin is real, remember this: If\nsin is real, both God AND YOU are not. If creation is EXTENSION, the Creator MUST\nhave extended HIMSELF, and it is impossible that what is PART of Him is totally\nunlike the rest. If sin is real, God must be at war WITHIN HIMSELF. HE must be\nsplit, and torn between good and evil; partly sane and partially insane. For He\nmust have created what wills to destroy Him, and HAS THE POWER TO DO SO. Is it\nnot EASIER to believe that YOU have been mistaken, than to believe in this?\n\nWhile you believe that YOUR reality, OR YOUR BROTHER'S, is bounded by\na body, you will believe in sin. While you believe that BODIES can unite, you\nwill find guilt attractive, and believe that sin is precious. For the belief that\nbodies LIMIT the mind leads to a perception of the world in which the PROOF of\nseparation seems to be everywhere. And God and His creation seem to be split\napart, and overthrown. For sin would PROVE what God created holy could not\nprevail against it, nor remain ITSELF before the power of sin.\n\nSin is perceived as mightier than God, before which God HIMSELF must\nbow, and offer His creation to its conqueror. Is this humility, or madness? If\nsin were real it would forever be beyond the hope of healing.\nFor there would be a power BEYOND God's, capable of making another will, which\ncould attack His Will, and OVERCOME it. And give His Son a will APART from His,\nand STRONGER. And each part of His fragmented creation would have a DIFFERENT\nwill OPPOSED to His, and in eternal opposition to Him AND TO EACH OTHER.\n\nYour holy relationship has, as its purpose now, the goal of proving\nTHIS is impossible. Heaven has smiled upon it, and the belief in sin has been\nuprooted in its smile of love. You SEE it still, because you do not realize that\nits FOUNDATION has gone. Its SOURCE has been removed, and so it can be cherished\nbut a little while, before it vanishes. Only the habit of LOOKING for it still\nremains. And yet you look with Heaven's smile upon YOUR lips, and Heaven's\nblessing on your sight.\n\nYou will NOT see it long. For, in the NEW perception, the mind\nCORRECTS it when it SEEMS to be seen, and it becomes invisible. But ERRORS are\nquickly recognized, and quickly given to correction, to be healed, NOT hidden.\nYOU will be healed of sin and all its ravages, the INSTANT that you give it no\npower over EACH OTHER. And you will HELP each other overcome MISTAKES, by\njoyously RELEASING one another from the belief in sin. In the holy instant, you\nwill see the smile of Heaven shining on BOTH of you. And you will shine upon each\nother, in glad acknowledgment of the grace that has been GIVEN you.\n\nFor sin will NOT prevail against a union Heaven has smiled upon. Your\nperception was HEALED in the holy instant Heaven gave you. Forget what you HAVE\nseen, and raise your eyes, in faith, to what you now CAN see. The barriers to\nHeaven will disappear before your holy sight. For you who were sightless have\nbeen GIVEN vision, and you CAN see. Look not for what has been REMOVED, but for\nthe glory that has been RESTORED, for you to see.\nLook upon your Redeemer, and behold what He would show you in each other. And let\nnot sin arise again, to blind your eyes. For sin would keep you separate, but\nyour Redeemer would have you look upon each other as yourself.\nFebruary , 1967.\n\nYour relationship is now a temple of healing, a place where all the\nweary ones can come and find rest. Here is the rest that waits for all, after the\njourney. And it is brought NEARER to all, by your relationship. As this peace\nexpands, from deep inside yourselves, to embrace ALL the Sonship and give it\nrest, it will encounter many obstacles. Some of them, YOU will try to interpose.\nOthers will seem to arise from elsewhere; from your brothers, and from various\naspects of the world OUTSIDE. But peace will gently cover them, extending past,\nCOMPLETELY unhindered.\n\nThe extension of the Holy Spirit's purpose, from YOUR relationship to\nothers, to bring them gently IN, has already begun. This is the way in which He\nwill bring means and goal in line. The peace He laid, deep within BOTH of you,\nwill quietly extend to EVERY aspect of your lives, surrounding both of you with\nglowing happiness, and the calm awareness of COMPLETE protection. And you will\ncarry its message of love and safety and freedom to everyone who draws nigh unto\nyour temple, where healing waits for him.\n\nYou will NOT wait to give him this. For you will CALL to him and he\nwill answer, RECOGNIZING in your call the call of God. And you will draw him in\nand give him rest, as it was given YOU. All this will you do. But the peace that\nalready lies deeply within, must first expand, and FLOW ACROSS the obstacles YOU\nplace before it. THIS IT WILL DO. For nothing undertaken WITH the Holy Spirit,\nremains unfinished. You can indeed be sure of NOTHING you see OUTSIDE you, but of\nthis you CAN be sure.\n\nThe Holy Spirit asks that you offer Him a resting-place, where YOU\nwill rest in Him. He answered you, and entered your relationship. Would you not\nnow RETURN His graciousness, and enter into a relationship with Him? For it is HE\nWho offered YOUR relationship the gift of holiness, without which it would have\nbeen forever impossible to appreciate each other. The gratitude you owe to Him,\nHe asks but that YOU receive, FOR Him. And, when you look with gentle\ngraciousness upon each other, you ARE beholding Him. For you are looking where He\nIS, and NOT apart from you.\n\nYou CANNOT see the Holy Spirit, but you CAN see your brothers truly.\nAnd the light in them will show you all that you NEED to see. When the peace in\nyou has been extended to encompass EVERYONE, the Holy Spirit's function here will\nbe accomplished. What NEED is there for SEEING, then? When God has taken the last\nstep Himself, the Holy Spirit will gather ALL your thanks and gratitude that you",

    "content": "Obstacles to Peace – I. The Desire to Get Rid of It\n\nThe first obstacle that peace must flow across is your desire to get\nRID of it. For it cannot extend, UNLESS you keep it. YOU are the center from\nwhich it radiates outward, to call the others IN. You are its home; its tranquil\ndwelling-place, from which it gently reaches out, but NEVER leaving YOU. If YOU\nwould make it homeless, how can it abide within the Son of God? If it would\nspread across the whole creation, it MUST begin with you. And, FROM you, reach to\neveryone who calls, and bring him rest by JOINING you.\n\nWhy would you want peace homeless? What do you think that it must\nDISPOSSESS, to dwell in you? What SEEMS to be the cost you are so unwilling to\npay? The little barriers of sand still stand between you. Would you reinforce\nthem NOW? You are NOT asked to let them go for yourselves alone. Christ asks it\nof you, for HIMSELF. He would bring peace to everyone. And how can He do this,\nEXCEPT through you? Would you let a little bank of sand, a wall of dust, a tiny\nseeming barrier stand between your brothers and salvation?\n\nAnd yet it IS this little remnant of attack you cherish still against\neach other, that is the first obstacle the peace in you encounters, in its going\nforth. This little wall of hatred would STILL oppose the Will of God, and keep It\nlimited. The Holy Spirit's purpose rests in peace within you. Yet you are STILL\nunwilling to let it JOIN you wholly. You still oppose the Will of God, just by a\nlittle. But that little IS a limit you would place upon the whole. God's Will is\nOne, NOT many. It HAS no opposition, for there is none BESIDE It.\n\nWhat you would still contain behind your little barrier, and keep\nSEPARATE from each other, is mightier than the universe. For it would HOLD BACK\nthe universe AND ITS CREATOR. This little wall would hide the purpose\nof Heaven, and keep it FROM Heaven. Would you thrust salvation AWAY from the\nGIVER of salvation? For such have YOU become. Peace could no more DEPART from you\nthan from God. Fear not this little obstacle. It can NOT contain the Will of God.\nPeace WILL flow across it, and join you WITHOUT hindrance.\n\nSalvation cannot BE withheld from you. It IS your purpose. You CANNOT\nwill APART from this. You HAVE no purpose apart from each other, nor apart from\nthe one you asked the Holy Spirit to SHARE with you. The little wall will fall\naway so quietly, beneath the wings of peace! For it will send its messengers from\nyou to all the world. And barriers will fall away before their coming, as easily\nas those which YOU would interpose will be surmounted. To overcome the world is\nno more difficult than to surmount your little wall. For in the miracle of YOUR\nrelationship, WITHOUT this barrier, is EVERY miracle contained.\n\nThere is no order of difficulty in miracles, for they ARE all the\nsame. Each is a gentle WINNING OVER, from the appeal of guilt to the appeal of\nlove. How can this FAIL to be accomplished, WHEREVER it is undertaken? Guilt can\nraise no REAL barriers against it. And all that seems to stand between you MUST\nfall away, because of the appeal YOU answered. And from you who answered, He Who\nanswered you would call. His home is in your holy relationship. Do not attempt to\nstand BETWEEN Him and His holy purpose, for it IS yours. But let Him quietly\nEXTEND the miracle of your relationship to everyone CONTAINED in it, as it was\ngiven.\n\nThere is a hush in Heaven, a happy expectancy, a little pause of\ngladness, in acknowledgment of the journey's end. For Heaven knows you well, as\nyou know Heaven. No illusions stand between you. Look not upon the little\nwall of shadows. The sun has risen OVER it. How can a shadow KEEP you from the\nsun? No more can YOU be kept by shadows from the light in which illusions end.\nEVERY miracle is but the end of an illusion. Such was the journey; such its\nending. And in the goal of truth, which you ACCEPTED, must ALL illusions end.\n\nThe little, insane wish to get rid of Him Whom you invited IN, and\npush Him OUT, MUST produce conflict. As you look upon the world, this little\nwish, uprooted and floating aimlessly, can land and settle briefly upon ANYTHING.\nFor it HAS no purpose now. BEFORE the Holy Spirit entered to abide with you, it\nSEEMED to have a MIGHTY purpose; the fixed and unchangeable dedication to sin and\nits results. Now it is aimless, wandering pointlessly, causing no more than tiny\ninterruptions in love's appeal.\n\nThis feather of a wish, this tiny illusion, this microscopic remnant\nof the belief in sin, is all that remains of what once SEEMED to be the world. It\nis no longer an unrelenting barrier to peace. Its pointless wandering makes its\nresults APPEAR to be more erratic and unpredictable than before. Yet what COULD\nbe more unstable than a tightly-organized delusional system? Its SEEMING\nstability is its pervasive WEAKNESS, which extends to EVERYTHING. The VARIABILITY\nwhich the little remnant induces, merely indicates its LIMITED results.\n\nHow mighty can a little feather be, before the great wings of truth?\nCan it oppose an eagle's flight, or hinder the advance of summer? Can it\ninterfere with the EFFECTS of summer's sun upon a garden covered by the snow? See\nbut how easily this little wisp is lifted up and carried away, never to return.\nAnd part with it in gladness, not regret. For it is nothing in itself, and STOOD\nFOR nothing when you had greater faith in its protection. Would you not rather\ngreet the summer sun, than fix your gaze upon a disappearing snowflake, and\nshiver in remembrance of the winter's cold?",

    "content": "The Attraction of Guilt\n\nThe attraction of guilt produces fear of love. For love would NEVER\nlook on guilt at all. It is the NATURE of love to look upon ONLY the truth, for\nthere it sees itself, with which it would unite in holy union and completion. As\nlove must look past fear, so must fear see love not. For love contains the END of\nguilt, as surely as fear DEPENDS on it. Love is attracted ONLY to love.\nOverlooking guilt completely, IT SEES NO FEAR. Being wholly without attack, it\nCOULD not be afraid.\n\nFear is attracted to what love sees NOT. And each believes that what\nthe other looks upon does not exist. Fear looks on guilt with just the same\ndevotion that love looks on itself. And each has messengers which they send\nforth, and which return to them with messages written in the language in which\ntheir going forth was asked. Love's messengers are gently sent, and return with\nmessages of love and gentleness. The messengers of fear are harshly ordered to\nseek out guilt, and cherish every scrap of evil and sin that they can find,\nlosing none of them on pain of death, and laying them respectfully before their\nlord and master.\n\nPerception cannot obey two masters, each asking for messages of\ndifferent things, in different languages. What fear would feed upon, love\noverlooks. What fear DEMANDS, love cannot even SEE. The fierce attraction that\nguilt holds for fear, is wholly absent from love's gentle perception. What love\nwould look upon is meaningless to fear, and quite invisible. Relationships in\nthis world are the result of how the world is seen. And this depends on which\nemotion was called on to send its messengers to look upon it, and return with\nword of what they saw.\n\nFear's messengers are trained through terror, and they tremble when\ntheir master calls upon them to serve him. For fear is merciless even to its\nfriends. Its messengers steal guiltily away in hungry search of guilt, for they\nare kept cold and starving, and made very vicious by their master, who allows\nthem to feast only upon what they return to him. No little shred of guilt escapes\ntheir hungry eyes. And in their savage search for sin, they pounce on any living\nthing they see, and carry it screaming to their master, to be devoured.\n\nSend not these savage messengers into the world, to feast upon it, and\nto prey upon reality. For they will bring you word of bones and skin and flesh.\nThey have been taught to seek for the corruptible, and to return with gorges\nfilled with things decayed and rotted. To them, such things are beautiful,\nbecause they seem to allay their savage pangs of hunger. For they are frantic\nwith the pain of fear, and would avert the punishment of him who sends them\nforth, by offering him what THEY hold dear.\n\nThe Holy Spirit has given you love's messengers, to send INSTEAD of\nthose YOU trained through fear. THEY are as eager to return to you what they hold\ndear, as are the others. If you send THEM forth, they will see only the blameless\nand the beautiful, the gentle and the kind. They will be as careful to let no\nlittle act of charity, no tiny expression of forgiveness, no little breaths of\nlove, escape their notice. And they will return, with all the happy things they\nfound, to share them lovingly with you. Be not AFRAID of them. They offer you\nsalvation. Theirs are the messages of SAFETY. For THEY see the world as kind.\n\nIf you send forth ONLY the messengers the Holy Spirit gave you,\nWANTING no messages but theirs, you will see fear no more. The world will be\ntransformed before your sight, cleansed of all guilt, and softly brushed with\nbeauty. The world contains no fear that YOU laid not upon it.\nAnd none you cannot ask love's messengers to REMOVE from it, and see it still.\nThe Holy Spirit has given you HIS messengers, to send each other, and return to\neach with what love sees. They have been given to REPLACE the hungry dogs of fear\nyou sent instead. And they go forth to signify the END of fear.\n\nLove, too, would set a feast before you, on a table covered with a\nspotless cloth, set in a quiet garden, where no sound but singing and a softly\njoyous whispering is ever heard. This is a feast which honors your holy\nrelationship, and at which everyone is welcomed as an honored guest. And in a\nholy instant grace is said by everyone together, as they join in gentleness\nbefore the table of communion. And I will join you there, as long ago I promised,\nand promise still. For in your new relationship am I made welcome, and where I am\nmade welcome, there I AM.\n\nI am made welcome in the state of grace, which means YOU HAVE AT LAST\nFORGIVEN ME. For I became the symbol of your sin, and so I had to die INSTEAD of\nyou. To the ego, sin MEANS death, and so Atonement IS ACHIEVED THROUGH MURDER.\nSalvation is looked upon as a way by which the Son of God was killed, instead of\nYOU. Yet would I offer you my BODY, you whom I love, KNOWING its littleness? Or\nwould I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart? Mine was of no greater value than\nyours; no better means for the COMMUNICATION of salvation, but NOT its Source.\n\nNo one can die for anyone, and death does not atone for sin. But you\ncan LIVE to show it is not REAL. The body DOES appear to be the symbol of sin,\nwhile you believe that it can get you what you want. While you believe that it\ncan give you pleasure, you will ALSO believe that it can bring you pain. To think\nyou could be satisfied and happy with so little, IS to hurt yourself. And to\nLIMIT the happiness that you would have, CALLS upon pain to fill your meager\nstore, and make your lives complete. This IS completion, as the ego sees it. For\nguilt creeps in where happiness has been removed, and SUBSTITUTES for it.\n\nCommunion is another kind of completion, which goes beyond guilt\nBECAUSE it goes beyond the body. Communion comes with peace, and peace MUST\ntranscend the body.",

    "content": "Obstacles to Peace – II. The Belief the Body is Valuable for What it Offers\n\nWe said that peace must first surmount the obstacle of your desire to\nget rid of it. Where the attraction of guilt holds sway, peace is NOT WANTED. The\nsecond obstacle that peace must flow across, and closely related to the first, is\nthe belief that the body is valuable FOR WHAT IT OFFERS. For here is the\nattraction of guilt MADE MANIFEST in the body, and SEEN in it.\n\nTHIS is the value that you think peace would ROB you of. This is what\nyou believe that it would dispossess, and leave YOU homeless. And it is this for\nwhich YOU would deny a home to peace. This “sacrifice” you feel to be too great\nto make, too much to ask of you. Is it a SACRIFICE, or a RELEASE? What has the\nbody REALLY given you, that justifies your strange belief that in it lies\nsalvation? Do you not see that this is the belief in DEATH? Here is the focus of\nthe perception of Atonement as murder. Here is the SOURCE of the idea that love\nis fear.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's messengers are sent far beyond the body, calling the\nmind to join in holy communion, and be at peace. Such is the message that I gave\nthem, for YOU. It is only the messengers of FEAR that see the body, for they look\nfor what can suffer. Is it a sacrifice to be REMOVED from what can suffer? The\nHoly Spirit does not DEMAND you “sacrifice” the hope of the body's pleasures. It\nHAS no hope of pleasure. But neither can it bring you fear of pain. Pain is the\nONLY “sacrifice” the Holy Spirit asks. And this He WOULD remove.\n\nPeace is extended from you only to the eternal. And it reaches out\nFROM the eternal in YOU. It flows across all else. The second obstacle is no more\nsolid than the first. For you will neither to get rid of peace, nor to LIMIT it.\nWhat are these obstacles that you would interpose between peace and its going\nforth, but barriers you place between your will and its accomplishment? You WANT\ncommunion, NOT the feast of fear. You WANT salvation, NOT the pain of guilt. AND\nYOU WANT YOUR FATHER, NOT a little mound of clay, to be your home.\n\nIn your holy relationship is your Father's Son. He has NOT lost\ncommunion with Him. NOR WITH HIMSELF. When you agreed to join each other, you\nacknowledged this is so. This has NO cost. But it HAS release from cost. You have\npaid very dearly for your illusions. And NOTHING you have paid for brought you\npeace. Are you not GLAD that Heaven can not BE sacrificed?\nAnd sacrifice can not BE asked of you? There IS no obstacle that you can place\nbefore our union, for in your holy relationship I am there ALREADY. We will\nsurmount all obstacles TOGETHER, for we stand WITHIN the gates, and not outside.\n\nHow easily the gates are opened from within, to let peace through to\nbless the tired world! Can it be difficult for us to walk past barriers together,\nwhen you have JOINED the Limitless? The end of guilt is in your hands, to give.\nWould you stop now, to LOOK for guilt in each other? Let me be to you the symbol\nof the END of guilt, and look upon each other, as you would look on me. Forgive\nme for all the sins you think the Son of God committed. And in the light of your\nforgiveness, he will remember who he is, and forget what never was.\n\nI ask for your forgiveness, for if YOU are guilty, so must I be. And\nif I surmounted guilt and overcame the world, you were WITH me. Would you see in\nme the symbol of guilt, or of the END of guilt? Remembering that what I signify\nto you, you see within YOURSELF? From your holy relationship, Truth proclaims the\ntruth, and Love looks on itself. Salvation flows from deep within the home you\noffered to my Father and to me. And we are there together, in the quiet communion\nin which the Father and the Son are joined.\n\nOh come ye faithful, to the holy union of the Father and Son in YOU.\nAnd keep YOU not apart from what is offered you, in gratitude for giving peace\nits home in Heaven. Send forth to all the world the joyous message of the end of\nguilt, and all the world will answer. Think of your happiness, as everyone offers\nyou witness of the end of sin, and shows you that its power is gone forever.\nWhere can guilt be, when the belief in sin is gone? And where is death, when\nits great advocate is heard no more?\n\nForgive me your illusions, and release me from punishment for what I\nhave NOT done. So will YOU learn the freedom that I taught ,by teaching freedom\nto each other, and so releasing me. I am within your holy relationship, yet you\nwould imprison me behind the obstacles you RAISE to freedom, and bar my way to\nYOU. Yet it is not possible to keep AWAY One Who is there ALREADY. And IN Him, it\nIS possible that our communion, where we are ALREADY joined, will be the focus of\nthe new perception that will bring light to all the world, contained in YOU.",

    "content": "Pleasure and Pain\n\nYour little part is but to give the Holy Spirit the whole IDEA of\nsacrifice. And to ACCEPT the peace He gave, instead. WITHOUT the limits that\nwould hold its extension back, and so would limit YOUR awareness of it. For what\nHe gives MUST be extended, if YOU would have its limitless power, and use it for\nthe Son of God's release. It is not THIS you would be rid of, and having it, you\nCANNOT limit it. If peace is homeless, so are you. And so am I. And He Who IS our\nHome, is homeless WITH us.\n\nIs this your will? Would you forever be a wanderer in search of peace?\nWould you invest your hope of peace and happiness in what MUST fail? Faith in the\neternal is ALWAYS justified, for the eternal is forever kind, infinite in its\npatience, and wholly loving. It will accept you wholly, and give you peace. But\nit can unite only with what ALREADY is at peace in you, immortal as itself. The\nbody can bring you neither peace nor turmoil; not pain nor joy. It is a means,\nand NOT an end. It HAS no purpose of itself, but only what is GIVEN it to do. The\nbody will seem to BE whatever is the means for reaching the goal that you ASSIGN\nto it.\n\nOnly the mind can set a purpose, and only mind can see the means for\nits accomplishment, and justify its use. Peace and guilt are both conditions of\nthe mind, to be ATTAINED. And these conditions are the home of the emotion that\ncalled them forth, and therefore is COMPATIBLE with it. But think you\nwhich it is that is compatible with YOU. Here is your choice, and it IS free. But\nall that LIES in it WILL come with it. And what you think you are can NEVER be\nAPART from it.\n\nThe body is the great SEEMING betrayer of faith. In it lies\ndisillusionment and the seeds of faithlessness. But ONLY if you asked of it what\nit CANNOT give. Can YOUR mistake be reasonable grounds for your depression and\ndisillusionment, and for retaliative attack on what you think has failed you? Use\nnot your ERROR as the justification for your faithlessness. You have NOT sinned,\nbut you HAVE been mistaken in what is faithful. And the correction of YOUR\nmistake will GIVE you grounds for faith.\n\nIt is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body, and NOT find\npain. It is essential that this relationship be understood, for it is one the ego\nsees as proof of sin. It is not REALLY punitive at all. It is but the inevitable\nresult of equating yourself WITH the body, which is the INVITATION to pain. For\nit invites FEAR to enter, and become your PURPOSE. The attraction of guilt MUST\nenter with it, and WHATEVER fear directs the body to do IS therefore painful. It\nwill share the pain of ALL illusions, and the illusion of pleasure will BE the\nsame as pain.\n\nIs not this inevitable? Under fear's orders, the body WILL pursue\nguilt, serving its master, whose attraction to guilt maintains the whole illusion\nof his existence. This, then, IS the attraction to PAIN. Ruled by THIS\nperception, the body becomes the servant of pain, seeking it dutifully, and\nobeying the idea that pain IS pleasure. It is this IDEA that underlies all of the\nego's heavy investment in the body. And it is this insane relationship which it\nkeeps hidden, and yet feeds upon. To YOU, it teaches that the body's pleasure is\nhappiness. But to ITSELF it whispers, “It is death.”\n\nWhy should the body be ANYTHING to you? Certainly what it is MADE of\nis not precious. And, just as certainly, IT has no feeling. It transmits TO YOU\nthe feelings that you WANT. Like any communication medium, the body receives and\nsends the messages that it is given. It has NO feeling for them. All of the\nfeeling with which they are invested is given by the sender and the receiver. The\nego and the Holy Spirit both recognize this. And both also recognize that here,\nTHE SENDER AND RECEIVER ARE THE SAME. The Holy Spirit TELLS you this with joy.\nThe ego HIDES it, for it would keep you unaware of it.\n\nWho would send messages of hatred and attack ,if he but understood he\nsends them to HIMSELF? Who would accuse, make guilty and condemn HIMSELF?\nThe ego's messages are ALWAYS sent AWAY from you, in the belief that, for your\nmessage of attack and guilt, will someone OTHER than yourself suffer. And, even\nif YOU suffer, yet someone ELSE will suffer more. The great deceiver recognizes\nthat this is not so, but, as the “enemy” of peace, it urges you to SEND OUT all\nyour messages of hate, and free YOURSELF. And, to convince you this is possible,\nit bids the body search for pain in attack upon another, calling it pleasure, and\nOFFERING it to you as freedom FROM attack.\n\nHear not its madness, and believe not the impossible is true. Forget\nnot that the ego has DEDICATED the body to the goal of sin, and places in it ALL\nits faith that this can be accomplished. Its sad disciples chant the body's\npraise continually, in solemn celebration of the ego's rule. Not one but MUST\nbelieve that YIELDING to the attraction of guilt is the ESCAPE from pain. Not one\nbut MUST regard the body as himself, WITHOUT which he would die, and yet WITHIN\nwhich is his death equally inevitable.\n\nIt is not given to the ego's disciples to realize that they have\ndedicated themselves to death. This has been OFFERED them, but they have not\naccepted it. And what is offered must also be received, to be truly given. For\nthe Holy Spirit, too, is a communication medium, receiving from the Father, and\noffering His messages unto the Son. Like to the ego, the Holy Spirit is both the",

    "content": "The Incorruptible Body\n\nFrom the ego came sin and guilt and death, in OPPOSITION to life and\ninnocence, and to the Will of God Himself. Where can such opposition lie, but in\nthe sick minds of the insane, dedicated to madness, and set AGAINST the peace of\nHeaven?\n\nOne thing is sure; God, Who created neither sin nor death, wills not\nthat you be bound by them. He knows of neither sin NOR its result. The shrouded\nfigures in the funeral procession march not in honor of their Creator, Whose Will\nit is they LIVE. They are not following it; they are OPPOSING it. And what is the\nblack-draped body they would bury? A body THEY dedicated to death, a symbol of\ncorruption, a sacrifice to sin, OFFERED to sin to feed upon, and keep ITSELF\nalive. A thing condemned, damned by its maker, and lamented by every mourner who\nlooks upon it as himself.\n\nYou who believe you have condemned the Son of God to this ARE\narrogant. But you who would RELEASE him are but honoring the Will of his Creator.\nThe arrogance of sin, the pride of guilt, the sepulchre of separation, all are\npart of your unrecognized dedication to death. The glitter of guilt you laid upon\nthe body would KILL it. For what the ego loves ,it kills for its obedience. But\nwhat obeys it not, it CANNOT kill. You have ANOTHER dedication which would keep\nthe body incorruptible and perfect, as long as it is useful for your holy\npurpose.\n\nThe body no more dies than it can feel. IT DOES NOTHING. Of itself, it\nis neither corruptible nor incorruptible. IT IS NOTHING. It is the result of a\ntiny, mad IDEA of corruption, WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED. For God has ANSWERED this\ninsane idea with His Own, an Answer which left Him not, and therefore brings the\nCreator to the awareness of every mind which heard His Answer, and ACCEPTED it.\nYou who are dedicated to the incorruptible, have been given, through YOUR\nacceptance, the power to RELEASE from corruption. What better way to teach the\nfirst and fundamental principle in a course on miracles than by showing you the\none that SEEMS to be the hardest can be accomplished FIRST?\n\nThe body can but serve your purpose. As you look upon it, so will it\nseem to be. Death, were it true, would be the final and complete disruption of\ncommunication, which IS the ego's goal. Those who fear death see not how often\nand how loudly they CALL to it, and bid it come to SAVE them from communication.\nFor death is seen as SAFETY, the great dark savior from the light of truth, the\nanswer to the Answer, the silencer of the Voice that speaks for God. Yet the\nretreat to death is NOT the end of conflict. Only God's ANSWER is its end.\n\nThe obstacle of your seeming love for death, which peace must flow\nacross, SEEMS to be very great. For in it lies hidden all the ego's secrets, all\nits strange devices for deception, all its sick ideas and weird imaginings. Here\nis the final end of union, the triumph of the ego's making over creation, the\nvictory of lifelessness on life Itself. Under the dusty edge of its distorted\nworld. the ego would lay the Son of God, slain by its orders, proof in his decay\nthat God Himself is powerless before the ego's might, unable to protect the life\nthat He created, against the ego's savage wish to kill.\n\nMy brothers, children of our Father, this is a DREAM of death. There\nis no funeral, no dark altars, no grim commandments, nor twisted rituals of\ncondemnation, to which the BODY leads you. Ask not release of IT. But FREE it\nfrom the merciless and unrelenting orders you laid upon it, and forgive it what\nyou ordered it to do. In its exaltation, you COMMANDED it to die, for only death\nCOULD conquer life. And what but insanity could look upon the defeat of God, and\nthink it REAL?\n\nThe fear of death will go as its appeal is yielded to love's REAL\nattraction. The end of sin, which nestles quietly in the safety of your\nrelationship, protected by your union, ready to grow into a mighty force for God,\nis very near. The infancy of salvation is carefully guarded by love, preserved\nfrom every thought that would attack it, and quietly made ready to fulfill the\nmighty task for which it was GIVEN you. Your new-born purpose is nursed by\nangels, cherished by the Holy Spirit, and protected by God Himself. It NEEDS not\nyour protection; it is YOURS. For it is deathless, and within it lies the END of\ndeath.\n\nWhat danger can assail the wholly innocent? What can attack the\nguiltless? What fear can enter and disturb the peace of sinlessness? What has\nbeen given you, even in its infancy, is in full communication with God AND you.\nIn its tiny hands, it holds, in perfect safety, every miracle you will perform,\nheld out to YOU. The miracle of life is ageless, born in time, but nourished in\neternity. Behold this infant, to whom you gave a resting place by your\nforgiveness of EACH OTHER, and see in it the Will of God. Here is the babe of\nBethlehem reborn. And everyone who gives him shelter will follow him, NOT to the\ncross, but to the Resurrection and the Life.\n\nWhen anything seems to you to be a source of fear, when any situation\nstrikes you with terror and makes your body tremble and the cold sweat of fear\ncomes over it, remember it is ALWAYS for one reason; the ego has perceived it as\na symbol of fear, a sign of sin and death. Remember, then, that neither sign nor\nsymbol should be CONFUSED with source, for they must STAND FOR something OTHER\nthan themselves. Their meaning CANNOT lie in them, but must be sought in what\nthey REPRESENT. And they may thus mean everything or nothing, according to the\ntruth or falsity of the IDEA which they reflect.\n\nConfronted with such seeming uncertainty of meaning, judge it not.\nRemember the holy Presence of the One GIVEN you to be the Source of judgment.\nGive it to Him to judge FOR you, and say:\n\n“Take this from me and look upon it, judging it for me.\n\nLet me not see it as a sign of sin and death, nor use it for destruction.\n",

    "content": "Obstacles to Peace - IV. The Fear of God\n\nWhat would you see, WITHOUT the fear of death? What would you feel and\nthink, if death held NO attraction for you? Very simply, YOU WOULD REMEMBER YOUR\nFATHER. The Creator of life, the Source of everything that lives, the Father of\nthe Universe, and of the Universe of universes, and of everything that lies even\nBEYOND them, would you remember. And, as this Memory rises in your mind, peace\nmust still surmount a final obstacle, AFTER which is salvation completed, and the\nSon of God ENTIRELY restored to sanity. For here, your world DOES end.\n\nThe fourth obstacle to be surmounted, hangs like a heavy veil before\nthe face of Christ. Yet, as His face rises beyond it, shining with joy because He\nis in His Father's love, peace will lightly brush the veil aside and run to meet\nHim, and to JOIN with Him at last. For this dark veil, which seems to make the\nface of Christ Himself like to a leper's, and the bright rays of His Father's\nLove which light His face with glory appear as streams of blood, fades in the\nblazing light BEYOND it, when the fear of death is gone.\n\nThis is the darkest veil, -- upheld by the belief in death, and\nprotected by its attraction. The dedication to death and to its sovereignty is\nbut the solemn vow, the promise made in secret to the ego, never to lift this\nveil, not to approach it, nor even to SUSPECT that it is there. This is the\nsecret bargain, made with the ego, to keep what lies BEYOND the veil forever\nblotted out and unremembered. Here is your promise never to allow union to call\nyou OUT of separation; the great amnesia in which the memory of God seems quite\nforgotten; the cleavage of your Self from you; THE FEAR OF GOD, the final step in\nyour dissociation.\n\nSee how the belief in death would seem to ‘save’ you. For, if this is\ngone, what can you fear but life? It is the attraction of death that makes life\nseem to be ugly, cruel, and tyrannical. You are no more afraid of death than of\nthe ego. These are your chosen FRIENDS. For, in your secret alliance with them,\nyou have agreed never to let the fear of God be lifted, so you could look upon\nthe face of Christ, and join Him in His Father. Every obstacle that peace must\nflow across is surmounted in just the same way; the fear that RAISED it yields to\nthe love beneath, and so the fear is gone. And so it is with this.\n\nThe desire to get rid of peace and drive the Holy Spirit FROM you,\nfades in the presence of the quiet recognition that you love Him. The exaltation\nof the body is given up in favor of the Spirit, which you love as you could NEVER\nlove the body. And the appeal of death is lost forever, as love's attraction\nstirs and calls to you. From BEYOND each of these OBSTACLES to love, Love Itself\nhas called, and each has been surmounted by the power of the attraction of what\nlies BEYOND. Your WANTING fear SEEMED to be holding them in place. Yet, when you\nheard the voice of love BEYOND them, you answered, and they disappeared.\n\nAnd now you stand in terror before what you swore never to look upon.\nYour eyes look down, remembering your promise to your ‘friends.’ The ‘loveliness’\nof sin; the delicate appeal of guilt, the ‘holy’ waxen image of death, and the\nfear of vengeance of the ego you swore in blood not to desert, all rise and bid\nyou NOT to raise your eyes. For you realize that if you look on THIS and LET the\nveil be lifted, THEY WILL BE GONE FOREVER. All of your ‘friends,’ your\n‘protectors,’ and your ‘home,’ will vanish. Nothing that you remember NOW, will\nyou remember.\n\nIt seems to you the world will utterly abandon you, if you but raise\nyour eyes. Yet all that WILL occur is YOU will leave the world forever. This is\nthe re-establishment of YOUR will. Look upon it, open-eyed, and you will\nnevermore believe that you are at the mercy of things BEYOND you, forces you can\nNOT control, and thoughts that come to you AGAINST your will. It IS YOUR WILL TO\nLOOK ON THIS. No mad desire, no trivial impulse to forget again, no stab of fear,",

    "content": "The Lifting of the Veil\n\nForget not that you came this far TOGETHER. And it was surely NOT the\nego that led you here. No obstacle to peace can BE surmounted through ITS help.\nIT does not open up its secrets, and bid you look at them, and go BEYOND them. IT\nwould not have you see its weakness and learn it has NO power to KEEP you from\nthe truth. The Guide Who brought you here REMAINS with you, and when you raise\nyour eyes, you WILL be ready to look on terror with no fear at all. But first,\nlift up your eyes and look upon each other in innocence, born of COMPLETE\nforgiveness of each other's illusions, and through the eyes of faith, which see\nthem not.\n\nNo-one can look upon the fear of God unterrified, unless he has\nACCEPTED the Atonement, and learned illusions are not real. No-one can stand\nbefore this obstacle alone, for he could not have REACHED it unless his brother\nwalked beside him. And no-one would dare to LOOK on it, without COMPLETE\nforgiveness of his brother in his heart. Stand you here a while, and tremble not.\nYou will be ready. Let us join together in a holy instant, here in this place\nwhere the purpose, GIVEN in a holy instant, has led you. And let us join in faith\nthat He Who brought us here together will OFFER you the innocence you need, and\nthat you will ACCEPT it for my love and His.\n\nNor is it POSSIBLE to look on this too soon. This is the place to\nwhich everyone must come, when he is ready. Once he has found his brother, he IS\nready. But merely to REACH a place is not enough. A journey without a purpose is\nstill meaningless. And even when it is over, it seems to make no sense. How can\nyou KNOW that it is over, unless you realize its purpose IS accomplished? Here,\nwith the journey's end before you, you SEE its purpose. And it is here you choose\nwhether to look upon it, or wander on, only to return and make the choice again.\n\nTo look upon the fear of God DOES need some preparation. Only the sane\ncan look on stark insanity and raving madness with pity and compassion, but NOT\nwith fear. For only if you SHARE in it does it seem fearful. And you DO share in\nit until you look upon each other with perfect faith and love and tenderness.\nBefore complete forgiveness, you still stand unforgiving. You are afraid of God\nBECAUSE you fear each other. Those you do not forgive, YOU FEAR. And no-one\nreaches love, with FEAR beside him.\n\nThis brother, who stands beside you, still seems to be a stranger. You\ndo NOT know him, and your INTERPRETATION of him is VERY fearful. And you attack\nhim still, to keep what seems to be YOURSELF unharmed. Yet in his hands IS your\nsalvation. You see his madness, which you hate because you SHARE in it. And all\nthe pity and forgiveness that would HEAL it, gives way to fear. Brothers, you\nNEED forgiveness of each other. For you will share in madness or in Heaven\nTOGETHER. And you will raise your eyes in FAITH together, or not at all.\n\nBeside each of you is one who offers you the chalice of Atonement, for\nthe Holy Spirit is in him. Would you hold his sins AGAINST him, or accept his\ngift to YOU? Is this giver of Salvation your friend or enemy? Choose which he is,\nremembering that you will RECEIVE of him according to your choice.\nHe has IN HIM the power to forgive YOUR sins, as you for HIM. Neither can give it\nto himself alone. And yet your Savior stands beside each one. Let him be what he\nIS, and seek not to make of love an enemy.\n\nBehold your Friend, the Christ Who stands beside you. How holy and how\nbeautiful He is! You THOUGHT He sinned, because you cast the veil of sin upon Him\nto HIDE His loveliness. Yet still He holds forgiveness out to you, to SHARE His\nholiness. This ‘enemy,’ this ‘stranger’ still offers you salvation as His Friend.\nThe ‘enemies’ of Christ, the worshippers of sin, know not Whom they attack. This\nis your brother, crucified by sin, and waiting for release from pain. Would you\nnot OFFER him forgiveness, when only he can offer it to you?\n\nFor HIS redemption he will give you yours, as surely as God created\nevery living thing, and loves it. And he will give it truly, for it will be both\noffered and RECEIVED. There is no grace of Heaven that you cannot OFFER to each\nother, and receive from your most holy Friend. Let him withhold it not, for by\nreceiving it, you offer it to HIM. And he WILL receive of you what YOU received\nof him. Redemption has been given you to give EACH OTHER, and thus receive it.\nWhom you forgive IS free. And what you give, YOU SHARE. Forgive the sins your\nbrother THINKS he has committed, and all the guilt YOU see in him.\n\nHere is the holy place of RESURRECTION, to which we come again; to\nwhich we will RETURN until redemption is accomplished AND RECEIVED. Think who\nyour brother IS, before you would condemn him. And offer thanks to God that he is\nholy, and has been given the gift of holiness for YOU. Join him in gladness, and\nremove all trace of guilt from his disturbed and tortured mind. Help him to lift\nthe heavy burden of sin you laid upon him, and he ACCEPTED as his own, and toss\nit lightly and with happy laughter AWAY from him. Press it not like thorns\nagainst his brow, nor nail him to it, unredeemed and hopeless.\n\nGive each other faith, for faith and hope and mercy ARE yours to give.\nInto the hands that give, the gift is given. Look on your brother, and see in him\nthe gift of God you would RECEIVE. It is almost Easter, the time of Resurrection.\nLet us give redemption to each other, and SHARE in it, that we may rise as one in\nresurrection, and not SEPARATE in death. Behold the gift of freedom that I gave\nthe Holy Spirit, for BOTH of you. And be you free together, as you offer TO the\nHoly Spirit this SAME gift, and, giving it, receive it OF Him, in RETURN for what\nyou gave.\n\nHe leadeth you and me together, that we might meet here, in this holy\nplace, and make the SAME decision. Free your brother here, as I freed you. Give\nhim the self-same gift, nor look upon him with condemnation of ANY kind. See him\nas guiltless as I look on you, and OVERLOOK the sins he THINKS he sees within\nhimself. Offer each other freedom and complete release from sin, here in the\ngarden of seeming agony and death. So will we prepare TOGETHER the way unto the\nResurrection of God's Son. And let him rise again to glad remembrance of his\nFather, Who knows no sin, no death, but ONLY life eternal.\n\nTogether we will disappear into the Presence BEYOND the veil, not to\nbe lost, but FOUND; not to be seen, but to be KNOWN. And, knowing, nothing in the\nplan God has established for salvation will be left undone. This is the journey's\npurpose, WITHOUT which IS the journey meaningless. Here is the Peace of God,\ngiven to you eternally by Him. Here is the rest and quiet that you seek, the\nREASON for the journey from its beginning. Heaven is the gift you OWE each other,\nthe debt of gratitude you offer to the Son of God, in thanks for what he is, and\nwhat his Father created him to be.\n\nThink carefully how you would look upon the giver of this gift, for as\nyou look on HIM, so will the gift ITSELF appear to be. As HE is seen as either\nthe giver of guilt or of salvation, so will his OFFERING be seen, and so\nRECEIVED. The crucified give pain, because they ARE in pain. But the redeemed\ngive joy, because they have been HEALED of pain. Everyone gives as he receives,\nbut HE must choose what it will BE that he receives. And he will RECOGNIZE his\nchoice by what he gives, and what is given HIM. Nor is it given anything in hell\nor Heaven to INTERFERE with his decision.\n\nYou came this far because the journey WAS your choice. And no-one\nundertakes to do what he believes is meaningless. What you had faith in still is\nfaithful, and watches over you in faith so gentle, yet so strong, that it would\nlift you far beyond the veil, and place the Son of God safely within the sure\nprotection of his Father. Here is the ONLY purpose that gives this world, and the\nlong journey THROUGH this world, whatever meaning lies in them. Beyond this, they",

Let no dark signs of crucifixion intervene\nbetween the journey and its purpose; between the ACCEPTANCE of the truth and its\nEXPRESSION.\n\nThis week we celebrate eternal life, NOT death. And we honor the\nperfect PURITY of the Son of God, and NOT his sins. Offer each other the gift of\nlilies, NOT the crown of thorns; the gift of love, and NOT the “gift” of fear.\nYou stand beside each other, thorns in one hand and lilies in the other,\nuncertain which to give.

    "content": "Thorns and Lilies\n\nLook upon all the trinkets made to hang upon the body or cover it, or\nfor its use. See all the useless things made for its eyes to see. Think on the\nmany offerings made for its pleasure, and remember all these were made to make\nseem lovely what you hate. Would you employ this hated thing to draw your brother\nto you, and to attract HIS body's eyes? Learn you but offer him a crown of\nthorns, not recognizing it for what it is, and trying to justify your OWN\ninterpretation of its value by HIS acceptance. Yet still the gift proclaims his\nworthlessness to YOU, as his acceptance and delight acknowledges the lack of\nvalue HE places on himself.\n\nGifts are not made through bodies, if they be truly given and\nreceived. For bodies can neither offer nor accept; hold out or take. Only the\nmind can value, and only the mind decides on what it would receive and give. And\nevery gift it offers depends on what it WANTS. It will adorn its chosen home most\ncarefully, making it ready to RECEIVE the gifts it wants, by offering them to\nthose who come unto its home, or those it would ATTRACT to it. And there they\nwill exchange their gifts, offering and receiving what their minds judge to be\nworthy of them.\n\nEach gift is an EVALUATION of the receiver AND THE GIVER. No-one but\nsees his chosen home an altar to HIMSELF. No-one but seeks to DRAW to it the\nworshippers of what he placed UPON it, making it WORTHY of their devotion. And\neach has set a light upon his altar, that they may see what he has placed upon\nit, and take it for their own. Here is the value that you lay upon your brother,\nand on YOURSELF. Here is your gift to BOTH; your judgment upon the Son of God for what he is. Forget not that it is YOUR\nSavior to whom the gift is offered. Offer him thorns, and YOU are crucified.\nOffer him lilies, and it is YOURSELF you free.\n\nI have great need for lilies, for the Son of God has not forgiven me.\nAnd can I offer HIM forgiveness, when he offers thorns to me? For he who offers\nthorns to anyone is against me still, and who is whole WITHOUT him? Be you his\nFriend for me, that I may be forgiven, and you may look upon the Son of God as\nwhole. But look you first upon the altar in your chosen home, and see what you\nhave laid upon it, to offer me. If it be thorns, whose points gleam sharply in a\nblood-red light, the body is your chosen home, and it is separation that you\noffer me.\n\nAnd yet the thorns are gone. Look you still closer at them now, and\nyou will see your altar is no longer what it was. You look still with the body's\neyes. And they CAN see but thorns. But you have asked for AND RECEIVED another\nsight. Those who accept the Holy Spirit's purpose as their own, share also in His\nvision. And what enables Him to SEE His purpose shine forth from every altar, now\nis yours as well as His. He sees NO strangers only dearly loved and loving\nFriends. He sees no thorns, but only lilies, gleaming in the gentle glow of peace\nthat shines on everything He looks upon and loves.\n\nThis Easter, look with DIFFERENT eyes upon each other. You HAVE\nforgiven me. And yet, I cannot USE your gift of lilies, while you see them not.\nNor can YOU use what I have given, unless\nyou SHARE it. The Holy Spirit's vision is no idle gift, no plaything to be tossed\nabout a while and laid aside. Listen and hear this carefully, nor think it but a\ndream; -- a careless thought to play with, or a toy you would pick up from time\nto time and then put by. For if you do, so will it be to you. You have the vision\nto look past ALL illusions. It has been given you to see no thorns, no strangers,\nand NO obstacles to peace.\n\nThe fear of God is NOTHING to you now. Who is afraid to look upon\nillusions, KNOWING his Savior stands beside him? WITH him, your vision has become\nthe greatest power for the UNDOING of illusion that God Himself could give. For\nwhat God gave the Holy Spirit, YOU have received. The Son of God looks unto YOU\nfor his release. For you have asked for AND BEEN GIVEN the strength to look upon\nthis final obstacle, and see no thorns nor nails to crucify the Son of God, and\ncrown him king of death. Your chosen home is on the other side, BEYOND the veil.\nIt has been carefully prepared for you, and it is ready to receive you now.\n\nYou will not see it with the body's eyes. But all you need, you have.\nYour home has called to you since time began, nor have you ever failed entirely\nto hear. You heard, but knew not HOW to look, nor WHERE. And now you KNOW. In you\nthe knowledge lies, ready to be unveiled and freed from all the terror that kept\nit hidden. There IS no fear in love. The song of Easter is the glad refrain the\nSon of God was NEVER crucified. Let us lift up our eyes together, not in fear,\nbut FAITH. And there WILL be no fear in us, for in our vision will be NO\nillusions. Only a pathway to the open door\nof Heaven, the home we share in quietness, and where we live in gentleness and\npeace, as One together.\n\nWould you not have your holy brother lead you there? His innocence\nwill light your way, offering you its guiding light and sure protection, and\nshining from the holy altar within him, where you laid the lilies of forgiveness.\nLet him be to you the Savior from illusions, and look on him with the new vision\nthat looks upon the lilies, and brings YOU joy. We go beyond the veil of fear,\nlighting each other's way. The holiness that leads us is WITHIN us, as is our\nhome. So will we find what we were MEANT to find, by Him Who leads us.\n\nThis is the way to Heaven and to the peace of Easter, in which we join\nin glad awareness that the Son of God is risen from the past, and has awakened to\nthe present. Now is he free, unlimited in his communion with all that is within\nhim. Now are the lilies of his innocence untouched by guilt, and perfectly\nprotected from the cold chill of fear and withering blight of sin alike. Your\ngift has saved him from the thorns and nails, and his strong arm is free to guide\nyou safely through them, and BEYOND. Walk with him now rejoicing, for the Savior\nfrom illusions has come to greet you, and lead you home with HIM.\n\nHere is your Savior and your Friend, RELEASED from crucifixion through\nYOUR vision, and free to lead you now where HE would be. He will not leave you,\nnor forsake the Savior from HIS pain. And gladly will you walk the way of\ninnocence together, singing as you behold the open door of Heaven, and\nRECOGNIZE the home that called to you. Give joyously to one another the freedom\nand the strength to lead you there. And come before each other's holy altar,\nwhere the strength and freedom wait, to offer and receive the bright awareness\nthat leads you home. The lamp is lit in both of you, for one another. And by the\nhands that GAVE it to each other, shall both of you be led past fear to Love.",

    "content": "Sin as an Adjustment\n\nThe belief in sin is an ADJUSTMENT. And an adjustment is a CHANGE, a\nshift in perception, or a belief that what was so before has been made DIFFERENT.\nEvery adjustment is therefore a DISTORTION, and calls upon defenses to uphold it\nAGAINST reality. Knowledge requires NO adjustment, and, in fact, is lost if any\nshift or change is undertaken. For this reduces it at once to mere perception; a\nway of LOOKING in which CERTAINTY is lost, and DOUBT has entered. To this\nIMPAIRED condition are adjustments necessary. BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TRUE. Who need\nadjust to truth, which calls upon only what he IS, to understand?\n\nAdjustments of ANY kind are of the ego. For it is the ego's fixed\nbelief that all relationships DEPEND upon adjustments, to make of them what it\nwould have them be. DIRECT relationships, in which there are NO interferences,\nare ALWAYS seen as dangerous. The ego is the self-appointed mediator of ALL\nrelationships, making whatever adjustments it deems necessary, and INTERPOSING\nthem BETWEEN those who would meet, to keep them separate and PREVENT their union.\nIt is this studied interference which makes it difficult to recognize your holy\nrelationship for what it is.\n\nThe holy do not interfere with truth. They are NOT afraid of it, for\nit is WITHIN it that they RECOGNIZED their holiness, and rejoiced at what they\nsaw. They looked on it directly, WITHOUT attempting to ADJUST themselves to it,\nor it to them. And so they saw that it was IN them, NOT deciding first where they\nwould have it be. Their looking merely asked a question, and it was WHAT THEY SAW\nthat answered . YOU make the world and THEN adjust to it. AND IT TO YOU. Nor is\nthere any difference between yourself and it in your perception, WHICH MADE THEM BOTH.\n\nA simple question yet remains, and NEEDS an answer. Do you LIKE what\nyou have made? A world of murder and attack, through which you thread your timid\nway through constant dangers, alone and frightened, hoping at most that death\nwill wait a little longer, before it overtakes you, and you disappear. YOU MADE\nTHIS UP. It is a picture of what you think YOU are; of how you SEE yourself. A\nmurderer IS frightened, and those who kill FEAR death. All these are but the\nfearful thoughts of those who would adjust themselves to a world MADE fearful by\ntheir adjustments. And they look out in sorrow from what is sad WITHIN, and see\nthe sadness THERE.\n\nHave you wondered what the world is REALLY like? How it would look\nthrough HAPPY eyes? The world you see is but a judgment on YOURSELF. IT is not\nthere at all. But judgment lays a sentence on it, JUSTIFIES it, and MAKES IT\nREAL. Such is the world you see; a judgment on yourself, and made by YOU. This\nsickly picture of yourself is carefully preserved by the ego, whose image it IS\nand which it loves, and placed OUTSIDE you, in the world. And TO this world must\nYOU adjust, as long as you believe this picture IS outside, and has you at its\nmercy.\n\nThis world IS merciless, and, were it outside you, you SHOULD indeed\nbe fearful. But it is YOU who made it merciless. And now, if mercilessness SEEMS\nto look back at you, IT CAN BE CORRECTED. Who, in a holy relationship, can long\nremain unholy? The world the holy see is one with them, just as the world the ego\nlooks upon is like itself. The world the holy see is beautiful because they see\ntheir innocence in it. They did not TELL it what it was. They did not make\nadjustments to fit their orders. They gently questioned it and whispered, “what\nare you?” And He Who watches over all perception answered.\n\nTake not the judgment of the world as answer to the question, “what am\nI?” The world BELIEVES in sin, but the belief that made it as you see it, is NOT\noutside you. Seek not to make the Son of God ADJUST to his insanity. There IS a\nstranger in him, who wandered carelessly into the home of Truth, and who will\nwander off. He came WITHOUT a purpose. But he will not remain before the shining\nlight the Holy Spirit offered, and you accepted. For there the STRANGER is made\nhomeless, and YOU are welcome. Ask not this transient stranger, “who am I?” He is\nthe only thing in all the universe that does not know.\n\nYet it is he you asked, and it is to HIS answer you would adjust. This\none wild thought, fierce in its arrogance and yet so tiny and so meaningless it\nslips unnoticed through the universe of truth, becomes your guide. To it you\nturn, to ask the MEANING of the universe. And of the one blind thing in all the\nseeing universe you ask, “how shall I look upon the Son of God?” Does one ask\njudgment of what is totally BEREFT of judgment? And if you HAVE, would you\nBELIEVE the answer? And ADJUST to it as if it were the truth? The world you look\non IS the answer that it gave you. And YOU have given it power to ADJUST the\nworld to MAKE its answer true.\n\nYou asked this puff of madness for the meaning of your unholy\nrelationship, and adjusted it according to its insane answer. How happy did it\nmake you? Did you meet with joy, to bless the Son of God, and give him thanks for\nall the happiness he held out to you? Did you RECOGNIZE each other as the eternal\ngift of God to you? Did you see the holiness that shone in both of you, to bless\nthe other? That is the purpose of your HOLY relationship. Ask not the means of\nits attainment of the one thing that still would have it be unholy. Give it NO\npower to ADJUST the means and end.\n\nPrisoners bound with heavy chains for years, starved and emaciated,\nweak and exhausted, and with eyes so long cast down in darkness they remember not\nthe light, do not leap up in joy the instant they are made free. It takes a while\nfor them to understand what freedom IS. You groped but feebly in the dust and\nfound each other's hand, uncertain whether to let it go, or to take hold on life\nso long forgotten. Strengthen your hold, and raise your eyes unto your strong\ncompanion, in whom the meaning of your freedom lies. He seemed to be crucified\nbeside you. And yet his holiness remained untouched and perfect, and with him\nbeside you shall you this day enter with him to Paradise, and know the peace of\nGod.\n\nSuch is my will for BOTH of you, and for each of you for one another,\nand for HIMSELF. Here there is only holiness, and joining without limit. For what\nis Heaven but union, direct and perfect, and WITHOUT the veil of fear upon it?\nHere are we one, looking with perfect gentleness upon each other, and on\nourselves. Here, all thought of ANY separation between us becomes impossible. You\nwho were prisoners in separation are now made free in Paradise. And here would I\nunite with you, my friends, my brothers, and my Self. Your gift unto each other\nhas given me the certainty our union will be soon. Share then this faith with me,\nwho KNOW that it is justified.\n\nThere is no fear in perfect love, BECAUSE it knows no sin. And it\nMUST look on others as on itself. Looking with charity within, what can it fear\nWITHOUT? The innocent see safety, and the pure see God within His Son, and look\nunto the Son to lead them to the Father. And where else would they go, but\nwhere they will to be? Each of you now will lead the other to the Father, as\nsurely as God created His Son holy, and kept him so. In your brother is the light\nof God's eternal promise of YOUR immortality. See HIM as sinless, and there can\nBE no fear in you.",

    "content": "Entering the Ark\n\nNothing can hurt you, unless you give it the power to do so. For YOU\ngive power as the laws of this world INTERPRET giving; as you give, you LOSE. It\nis not up to you to give power at all. Power is of God, given by Him, and REAWAKENED\nby the Holy Spirit, Who knows that, as you give you GAIN. He gives NO\npower to sin, and therefore it HAS none. Nor to its results, as this world sees\nthem; sickness and death and misery and pain. These things have not occurred,\nbecause the Holy Spirit sees them not, and gives no power to their seeming\nsource. Thus would He keep you free of them.\n\nBeing without illusion of what you are, the Holy Spirit merely gives\neverything to God, Who has already given AND RECEIVED all that is true. The\nUNtrue He has neither received NOR given. Sin has no place in Heaven, where its\nresults are alien, and can no more enter than can their source. And therein lies\nyour need to see your brother sinless. In him is Heaven. See sin in him INSTEAD,\nand Heaven is lost to YOU. But see him as he IS, and what is yours shines from\nhim to you.\n\nYour Savior gives you ONLY love. But what you would RECEIVE of him, is\nup to you. It lies in him to overlook ALL your mistakes, and therein lies his OWN\nsalvation. And so it is with YOURS. Salvation is a lesson in giving, as the Holy\nSpirit interprets it. It is the re-awakening of the laws of God in minds that\nhave established OTHER laws, and given them power to enforce what God created\nnot. Your insane laws were made to GUARANTEE that you would make mistakes, and\ngive them power over you by ACCEPTING their results as your just due.\n\nWhat COULD this be but madness? And is it THIS that you would see\nwithin your Savior FROM insanity? He is as free from this as you are, and in the\nfreedom that you see in HIM, you see your own. For this you SHARE. What God has\ngiven follows HIS laws, and His alone. Nor is it possible for those who follow\nthem to suffer the results of any other source. Those who choose freedom will\nexperience only ITS results. Their power is of God. And they will give it only to\nwhat GOD has given, to SHARE with them.\n\nNothing but this can touch them, for they see ONLY this, sharing their\npower according to the Will of God. And thus their freedom is established AND\nMAINTAINED. It is upheld through ALL temptations to imprison and to BE\nimprisoned. It is THEM, who learned of freedom, that you should ask what freedom\nIS. Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars, for those with little wings have not\naccepted for THEMSELVES the power to share with you. The sinless give as they\nreceived. See, then, the power of sinlessness within your brother, and share with\nhim the power of the RELEASE from sin you offered HIM.\n\nTo each who walks this earth in seeming solitude is a Savior given,\nwhose special function here is to release him, and so to free himself. In the\nworld of separation, each is appointed separately, though they are all the same.\nBut those who KNOW that they are all the same, need not salvation. And each one\nFINDS his Savior, when he is ready to look upon the face of Christ, and see Him\nsinless. The plan is not of you, nor need you be concerned with anything except\nthe part that has been given YOU to learn. For He Who knows the rest will see to\nit WITHOUT your help. But think not that He does not need your part, to help Him\nwith the rest. For in your part lies ALL of it, without which is no part\ncomplete, nor is the whole completed WITHOUT your part. The ark of peace is\nentered two by two, yet the beginning of another world goes with them. Each\nholy relationship\nmust enter here, to learn its special function in the Holy Spirit's plan, now\nthat it SHARES His purpose. And as this purpose is fulfilled, a new world rises,\nin which sin can enter not, and where the Son of God can enter WITHOUT fear. And\nwhere he rests a while, to forget imprisonment, and to remember freedom.\n\nHow can he enter, to rest and to remember, without YOU? Except you be\nthere, he is NOT complete, and it is his COMPLETION that he remembers there. This\nis the purpose GIVEN you. Think not that your forgiveness of each other serves\nbut you two alone. For the whole new world rests in the hands of every two who\nenter here, to rest. And as they rest, the face of Christ shines on them, and\nthey remember the laws of God, forgetting all the rest, and yearning only to have\nHis laws perfectly fulfilled in them and all their brothers.\n\nThink you, when this has been achieved, that you will rest WITHOUT\nthem? You could no more leave one of them outside than I could leave you and\nforget part of myself. You may wonder how you can BE at peace when, while you are\nin time, there is so much that must be done BEFORE the way to peace is open.\nPerhaps this seems impossible to YOU. But ask yourself if it is possible that GOD\nwould have a plan for your salvation that does NOT work. Once you accept HIS plan\nas the ONE function that you would fulfill, there WILL be nothing else the Holy\nSpirit will not ARRANGE for you, WITHOUT your effort.\n\nHe will go before you, making straight your path, and leaving in your\nway no stones to trip on, and no obstacles to bar your way. NOTHING you need will\nbe denied you. Not one seeming difficulty but will melt away BEFORE you reach it.\nYou need take thought for nothing, careless of everything except the only purpose\nthat you would fulfill. As THAT was given you, so will its fulfillment be. God's\nguarantee will hold against\nALL obstacles, for it rests on certainty and NOT contingency. IT RESTS ON YOU.\nAnd what can be more certain than the Son of God?",

    "content": "Heralds of Eternity\n\nIn this world, God's Son comes closest to himself in a holy\nrelationship. There he begins to find the certainty his Father has in him. And\nthere he finds his function of restoring his Father's laws to what was held\nOUTSIDE them, and finding what was lost. Only in time can anything BE lost, but\nnever lost forever. So do the parts of God's Son gradually join in time, and with\neach joining is the end of time brought nearer. Each miracle of joining is a\nmighty herald of eternity. No-one who has a single purpose, unified and sure, can\nBE afraid. No-one who SHARES his purpose with him can NOT be one with him.\n\nEach herald of eternity sings of the end of sin and fear. Each speaks\nin time of what is far BEYOND it. Two voices, raised together, call to the hearts\nof everyone, and let them beat as one. And in that single heart beat is the unity\nof love proclaimed and given welcome. Peace to your holy relationship, which has\nthe power to hold the unity of the Son of God together. You give to one another\nfor EVERYONE. And in your gift is everyone made glad. Forget not Who has given\nYOU the gifts you give. And through your NOT forgetting this, will you remember\nWho gave the gifts to Him to give to you.\n\nIt is impossible to over-estimate your brother's value. Only the ego\ndoes this, but all it means is that it WANTS the other for ITSELF, and therefore\nvalues him too little. What is inestimable clearly cannot BE evaluated. Do you\nrecognize the fear that rises from the meaningless attempt to judge what lies so\nfar BEYOND your judgment you cannot even SEE it? Judge not what is invisible to\nyou, or you will NEVER see it. But wait in patience for its coming. -􀃆\nIt will be GIVEN you to see your brother's worth, when all you WANT for him is\npeace. And what you want for HIM, you will receive.\n\nHow can you estimate the worth of him who offers peace to you? What\nwould you want EXCEPT his offering? His worth has been established by his Father,\nand you will RECOGNIZE it as you receive his Father's gift through him. What is\nin him will shine so brightly in your grateful vision, that you will merely love\nhim, and be glad. You will not think to judge him. Who would SEE the face of\nChrist, and yet insist that judgment still has meaning? For this insistence is of\nthose who do NOT see. Vision OR judgment is your choice, but never BOTH of these.\n\nYour brother's body is as little use to you as it is to him. When it\nis used ONLY as the Holy Spirit teaches, it has no function. For minds NEED not\nthe body to communicate. The sight that SEES the body, has no use which serves\nthe purpose of a holy relationship. And while you look upon each other thus, the\nmeans and end have NOT been brought in line. Why should it take so many holy\ninstants to let this be accomplished, when one would do? There IS but one. The\nlittle breath of eternity that runs through time like golden light is all the\nsame. Nothing before it; nothing afterwards.\n\nYou look upon each holy instant as a DIFFERENT point in time. IT NEVER\nCHANGES. All that it ever held or will ever hold is here right now. The past\ntakes nothing FROM it, and the future will ADD no more. Here, then, is\nEVERYTHING. Here is the loveliness of your relationship, with means and ends in\nperfect harmony ALREADY. Here is the perfect faith that you will one day offer to\neach other, ALREADY offered you. And here the limitless forgiveness you will give\neach other is ALREADY given; the face of Christ you yet will look upon ALREADY\nseen.\n\nCan you EVALUATE the giver of a gift like this? Would you EXCHANGE\nthis gift for ANY other? This gift returns the laws of God to your remembrance.\nAnd merely BY remembering them, the laws that held you prisoner to pain and death\nMUST be forgotten. This is no gift your brother's BODY offers you. The veil that\nhides the gift hides him as well. He IS the gift, and yet he knows it not. No\nmore do you. And yet have faith that He Who sees the gift in BOTH of you, will\noffer and receive it for you BOTH. And through His vision will YOU see it, and\nthrough His understanding RECOGNIZE it, and love it as your own.\n\nBe comforted, and feel the Holy Spirit watching over you, in love and\nperfect confidence in what He sees. He knows the Son of God. And shares his\nFather's certainty the universe rests in his gentle hands in safety and in peace.\nLet us consider now what he must learn, to SHARE his Father's confidence in him.",

    "content": "The Temple of the Holy Spirit\n\nThe meaning of the Son of God lies solely in his relationship with his\nCreator. If it were elsewhere, it WOULD rest upon contingency, but there IS\nnothing else. And this is wholly loving and forever. Yet has the Son of God\ninvented an unholy relationship between him and his Father. His REAL relationship\nis one of perfect union, and unbroken continuity. The one he made is partial,\nself-centered, broken into fragments and full of fear. The one created by his\nFather is wholly self-encompassing and self-EXTENDING. The one he made is wholly\nself-DESTRUCTIVE and self-limiting.\n\nNothing can show the contrast better than the experience of both a\nholy and an unholy relationship. The first is based on love, and rests on it\nserene and undisturbed. THE BODY DOES NOT INTRUDE UPON IT. Any relationship in\nwhich the body enters is based, NOT on love, but on idolatry. Love wishes to be\nknown, COMPLETELY understood, and shared. IT HAS NO SECRETS; nothing that it\nwould keep apart and hide. It walks in sunlight, open-eyed and calm, in smiling\nwelcome, and in sincerity so simple and so obvious it cannot BE misunderstood.\n\nBut idols do not share. Idols ACCEPT, but never make return. They can\nBE loved, but cannot love. They do not understand what they are offered, and any\nrelationship in which they enter, has LOST its meaning. The love of THEM has MADE\nlove meaningless. They live in secrecy, hating the sunlight, and happy in the\nbody's darkness, where they can hide, and keep their secrets hidden, along with\nthem. And they have NO relationships, for no-one else is welcome there. They\nsmile on no-one, and those who smile on them they do not see.\n\nLove has no darkened temples, where mysteries are kept obscure and\nhidden from the sun. IT DOES NOT SEEK FOR POWER, but for RELATIONSHIPS. The body\nis the ego's chosen weapon for seeking power THROUGH relationships. And its\nrelationships MUST be unholy, for what they ARE, it does not even SEE. It wants\nthem solely for the offerings on which its idols thrive. The rest it merely\nthrows away, for all that IT could offer, is seen as valueless. Homeless, the ego\nseeks as many bodies as it can collect, to place its idols in, and so establish\nthem as temples to itself.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's temple is NOT a body, but a RELATIONSHIP. The body\nis an isolated speck of darkness; a hidden secret room, a tiny spot of senseless\nmystery, a meaningless enclosure carefully protected, yet\nhiding nothing. Here, the unholy relationship escapes reality, and seeks for\ncrumbs to keep itself alive. Here it would drag its brothers, holding them here\nin its idolatry. Here it is “safe,” for here love CANNOT enter. The Holy Spirit\ndoes not build His temples where love can never be. Would He Who SEES the face of\nChrist choose as His home the only place in all the universe where it can NOT be\nseen?\n\nYou CANNOT make the body the Holy Spirit's temple, and it will NEVER\nbe the seat of love. It is the home of the idolater, and of love's CONDEMNATION.\nFor here is love made fearful, and hope abandoned. Even the idols that are\nworshipped here are shrouded deep in mystery, and kept APART from those who\nworship them. This is the temple dedicated to no relationships, and no return.\nHere is the “mystery” of separation perceived in awe and held in reverence. What\nGod would have NOT be, is here kept “safe” from Him. But what you do NOT realize\nis what you fear within your brother, and would not SEE in HIM, is what makes God\nseem fearful and kept unknown.\n\nIdolaters will ALWAYS be afraid of love. For nothing so severely\nthreatens them as love's approach. Let love draw near them and OVERLOOK the body,\nas it will surely do, and they retreat in fear, feeling the seeming firm\nfoundation of their temple begin to shake and loosen. Brothers, you tremble with\nthem. But what you fear is but the herald of escape. This place of darkness is\nNOT your home. Your temple is NOT threatened. You are idolaters no longer. The\nHoly Spirit's purpose lies safe in your RELATIONSHIP, and NOT your bodies. You\nhave ESCAPED the body. Where you are now, the BODY cannot enter, for the Holy\nSpirit has set HIS temple there.\n\nThere is no order in relationships. They either ARE, or not. An unholy\nrelationship is NO relationship. It is a state of isolation, which SEEMS to be\nwhat it is NOT. No more than that. The instant that the\nmad idea of making your relationship with God unholy seemed to be possible, ALL\nrelationships were made meaningless. In that unholy instant time was born, and\nbodies made to house the mad idea, and give it the ILLUSION of reality. And so it\nSEEMED to have a home, that held together for a little while in time, and\nvanished. For what could house this mad idea AGAINST reality, but for an instant?\n\nIdols MUST disappear, and leave no trace behind their going. The\nunholy instant of their seeming power is frail as is a snowflake, but without its\nloveliness. Is this the substitute you WANT, for the eternal blessing of the holy\ninstant, and its unlimited beneficence? Is the malevolence of the unholy\nrelationship, so seeming powerful and so bitterly misunderstood, and so invested\nin FALSE attraction, your preference to the holy instant, which offers peace and\nunderstanding? Then lay aside the body and quietly TRANSCEND it, rising to\nwelcome what you REALLY want. And from His holy temple look you not back on what\nyou have awakened FROM. For no illusions CAN attract the minds that have\nTRANSCENDED them, and left them far behind.\n\nThe holy relationship reflects the TRUE relationship the Son of God\nhas with his Father in reality. The Holy Spirit rests within it, in the certainty\nit will endure forever. Its firm foundation is eternally upheld by truth, and\nlove shines on it with the gentle smile and tender blessing it offers to its own.\nHere the unholy instant is exchanged in gladness for the holy one of safe return.\nHere is the way to true relationships held gently open, through which you walk\ntogether, leaving the body thankfully behind, and resting in the Everlasting\nArms. Love's arms are open to receive you, and give you peace forever.\n\nThe body is the ego's idol; the belief in sin made flesh, and then\nprojected outward. This produces what SEEMS to be a wall of flesh AROUND the\nmind, keeping it prisoner in a tiny spot of space and time, beholden unto death,\nand given but an instant in which to sigh and grieve and die in honor of its\nmaster. And this unholy instant SEEMS to be life. An instant of despair, a tiny\nisland of dry sand, bereft of water, and set uncertainly upon oblivion. Here does\nthe Son of God stop briefly by, to offer his devotion to death's idols, and then\npass on.\n\nAnd here he is more dead than living. But it is also here he makes his\nchoice again, between idolatry and love. Here it is given him to choose to spend\nthis instant paying tribute to the body, or LET himself be given freedom from it.\nHere he can ACCEPT the holy instant, offered him to REPLACE the unholy one he\nchose before. And here can he learn relationships are his SALVATION, NOT his\ndoom. You who ARE learning this may still be fearful, but you are NOT\nimmobilized. The holy instant IS of greater value now to you than its unholy\nseeming counterpart, and you HAVE learned you REALLY want but one.\n\nThis is no time for sadness. Perhaps confusion, but hardly\ndiscouragement. YOU HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP. And it HAS meaning. It is as like\nyour real relationship with God, as equal things are like themselves. Idolatry is\npast and meaningless. Perhaps you fear each other a little yet; perhaps a shadow\nof the fear of God remains with you. But what is that to those who have been\ngiven one TRUE relationship, BEYOND the body? Can they be long held back from\nlooking on the face of Christ? And can they long withhold the memory of their\nrelationship with their Father FROM themselves, and keep remembrance of His Love\nAPART from their awareness?",

    "content": "The Consistency of Means and End\n\nWe have said much about discrepancies of means and end, and how these\nmust be brought in line before your holy relationship can bring you ONLY joy. But\nwe have also said the means to meet the Holy Spirit's goal will come from the\nsame Source as does His purpose. Being so simple and direct, this course has\nNOTHING in it that is not consistent. The SEEMING inconsistencies, or parts you\nfind more difficult than others, are merely indications of areas where means and\nend are still discrepant. And this produces great discomfort. This NEED not be.\nThis course requires almost NOTHING of you. It is impossible to imagine one that\nasks so little, or could offer more.\n\nThe period of discomfort that follows the sudden change in a\nrelationship from sin to holiness, should now be almost over. To the extent you\nstill experience it, you are REFUSING to leave the means to Him Who changed the\npurpose. You recognize you WANT the goal. Are you not also willing to ACCEPT the\nmeans? If you are not, let us admit that YOU are inconsistent. A purpose is\nATTAINED by means. And if you WANT a goal, you MUST be willing to want the means\nas well. How can one be sincere and say, “I want this above all else, and yet I\ndo not want to learn the means to get it?”\n\nTo obtain the GOAL, the Holy Spirit indeed asked little. He asks no\nmore to give the means as well. The means are second to the goal. And, when you\nhesitate, it is because the PURPOSE frightens you, and NOT the means. Remember\nthis, for otherwise you will make the error of believing the MEANS are difficult.\nYet how CAN they be difficult if they are merely GIVEN you? They GUARANTEE the\ngoal. And they are PERFECTLY in line with it. Before we look at them a little\ncloser, remember that if you think THEY are impossible, your wanting of the\nPURPOSE has been shaken. For if a GOAL is possible to reach, the means to do so\nMUST be possible as well.\n\nIt IS impossible to see your brother sinless, and yet to look upon him\nas a body. Is this not perfectly consistent with the goal of holiness? For\nholiness is merely the result of letting the effects of sin be lifted, so what\nwas ALWAYS true is RECOGNIZED. To see a SINLESS body is impossible. For holiness\nis POSITIVE, and the body is merely neutral. It is NOT sinful, but neither is it\nsinless. As nothing, which it IS, the body cannot meaningfully be invested with\nattributes of Christ OR of the ego. EITHER must be an error, for both would place\nthe attributes where they cannot BE. And BOTH must be undone, for purposes of\ntruth.\n\nThe body IS the means by which the ego tries to make the unholy\nrelationship seem real. The unholy instant IS the time of bodies. But the PURPOSE\nhere is sin. It cannot BE attained but in illusion. And so the illusion of a\nbrother as a body is quite in keeping with the purpose of unholiness. BECAUSE of\nthis consistency, the means remain unquestioned while the end is cherished.\nVision adapts to wish, for sight is ALWAYS secondary to desire. And if you see\nthe body, you have chosen judgment, and NOT vision. For vision, like\nrelationships, HAS no order. You either SEE, or not.\n\nWho sees a brother's body has laid a JUDGMENT on him, and sees him\nnot. He does not REALLY see him as sinful; he does not see him at all. In the\ndarkness of sin, he is INVISIBLE. He can but be IMAGINED in the darkness, and it\nis here that the illusions you hold about him are NOT held up to his reality.\nHere are illusions and reality kept SEPARATED. Here are illusions NEVER brought\nto truth, and ALWAYS hidden from it. And here, in darkness, is your brother's\nreality IMAGINED as a body, in unholy relationships with other bodies, serving\nthe cause of sin an instant, before he dies.\n\nThere is indeed a difference between this vain imagining and vision.\nThe difference lies not in THEM, but in their purpose. Both are but MEANS, each\none appropriate to the end for which it is employed. Neither can serve\nthe purpose of the other, for each one is a CHOICE of purpose, employed on its\nbehalf. Either is meaningless WITHOUT the end for which it was intended, nor is\nit valued as a SEPARATE thing, APART from the intention. The means seem real\nbecause the GOAL is valued. And judgment HAS no value unless the GOAL is sin. The\nbody can NOT be looked upon EXCEPT through judgment. To see the body is the sign\nthat you LACK vision, and have DENIED the means the Holy Spirit offers you, to\nserve HIS purpose.\n\nHow can a holy relationship achieve its purpose through the means of\nsin? Judgment you taught YOURSELF; vision is learned from Him Who would UNDO your\nteaching. HIS vision cannot see the body, BECAUSE IT CANNOT LOOK ON SIN. And thus\nit leads you to reality. Your holy brother, sight of whom is YOUR release, is no\nillusion. Attempt to see him not in darkness, for your imaginings about him WILL\nseem real there. You CLOSED your eyes to shut him out. Such was your PURPOSE, and\nwhile this purpose seems to have ANY meaning, the means for its attainment will\nbe evaluated as WORTH the seeing, and so you will NOT see.\n\nYour question should not be, “How can I see my brother without the\nbody?” Ask only, “Do I REALLY wish to see him sinless?” And, as you ask, forget\nnot that HIS sinlessness is YOUR escape from fear. Salvation is the Holy Spirit's\ngoal. The means is vision. For what the seeing look upon IS sinless. No-one who",

    "content": "The Vision of Sinlessness\n\nVision will come to you at first in glimpses, but they will be enough\nto show you what is given YOU who see your brother sinless.\n\nTruth is restored to you through your desire, as it was lost to you\nthrough your desire for something ELSE. Open the holy place which you closed off\nby VALUING the something else, and what was never lost will\nquietly return. It HAS been saved for you. Vision would not be necessary, had\njudgment not been made. Desire now its whole undoing, and it is done FOR you. Do\nyou not WANT to know your own identity? Would you not happily exchange your\ndoubts for certainty? Would you not willingly be FREE of misery, and learn again\nof joy? Your holy relationship offers all this to you. As IT was given you, so\nwill be its EFFECTS.\n\nAnd as its holy purpose was not made by you, the means by which its\nhappy end is yours is also not of you. Rejoice in what is yours but for the\nasking. And think not that you need make either means OR end. All this is GIVEN\nyou, who would but SEE your brother sinless. All this is GIVEN, waiting on your\ndesire but to RECEIVE it. Vision is freely given to those who ask to see. Your\nbrother's sinlessness is given you in shining light, to look on with the Holy\nSpirit's vision, and to rejoice in, along with Him. For peace will come to all\nwho ask for it with real desire and sincerity of purpose, SHARED with the Holy\nSpirit, and at one with Him on what salvation IS.\n\nBe willing, then, to see your brother sinless, that Christ may rise\nbefore your vision and give you joy. And place NO value on your brother's body,\nwhich held him to illusions of what he is. It is HIS desire to see his\nsinlessness, as it is YOURS. And bless the Son of God in your relationship, nor\nsee in him what you have MADE of him. The Holy Spirit GUARANTEES that what God\nhas willed and given shall be yours. This is YOUR purpose now, and the vision\nthat makes it yours is ready to be given. You have the vision that enables you to\nsee the body not.\nAnd as you look upon each other, you will see an altar to your Father, holy as\nHeaven, glowing with radiant purity, and sparkling with the shining lilies you\nlaid upon it.\n\nWhat can you value more than this? Why do you think the body is a\nbetter home, a safer shelter for God's Son? Why would you rather look on IT than\non the truth? How can the engine of destruction be PREFERRED, and chosen to\nREPLACE the holy home the Holy Spirit offers, where HE will dwell WITH you? The\nbody is the sign of weakness, vulnerability and LOSS of power. Can such a Savior\nHELP you? Would you turn, in your distress and need for help, unto the HELPLESS?\nIs the pitifully LITTLE the perfect choice to call upon for strength? Judgment\nWILL seem to make your Savior weak. But it is YOU who need his strength.\n\nThere is no problem, no event or situation, no perplexity, that vision\nwill not solve. All is redeemed, when looked upon with vision. For this is not\nYOUR sight, and brings with it the laws beloved of Him Whose sight it IS.\nEverything looked upon with vision falls gently into place, according to the laws\nbrought TO it by His calm and certain sight. The end, for everything HE looks\nupon, is ALWAYS sure. For it will meet His purpose, seen in UNADJUSTED form, and\nsuited perfectly to meet it. Destructiveness becomes benign, and sin is turned to\nblessing under His gentle gaze.\n\nWhat can the body's eyes perceive, with power to CORRECT? Its eyes\nADJUST to sin, unable to overlook it in ANY form, and\nseeing it EVERYWHERE, in EVERYTHING. Look through ITS eyes, and EVERYTHING will\nstand condemned before you. All that could SAVE you, you will never see. Your\nholy relationship, the SOURCE of your salvation, will be DEPRIVED of meaning, and\nits most holy purpose bereft of means for its accomplishment. Judgment is but a\ntoy, a whim, the senseless means to play the idle game of death in your\nimagination. But vision sets all things right, bringing them gently within the\nkindly sway of Heaven's laws.\n\nWhat if you recognized this world is a hallucination? What if you\nREALLY understood you made it up? What if you realized that those who SEEM to\nwalk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy themselves, are\nWHOLLY unreal? Could you have FAITH in what you see, if you ACCEPTED this? AND\nWOULD YOU SEE IT? Hallucinations disappear when they are RECOGNIZED for what they\nare. This IS the healing and the remedy. Believe them not, and they ARE gone. And\nall YOU need to do is recognize YOU DID THIS. Once you ACCEPT this simple fact,\nand take unto YOURSELF the power you gave them, YOU are released from them.\n\nOne thing is sure; hallucinations serve a purpose, and when that\nPURPOSE is no longer held, THEY disappear. Therefore, the question never is\nwhether you want THEM, but ALWAYS do you want the purpose that they serve? This\nworld SEEMS to hold out many purposes, each different, and with different values.\nYet they are all the same. Again, there is no order, but a SEEMING hierarchy of\nvalues. Only two purposes are possible. And one is sin; the other holiness.\nNothing is in between, and which you choose determines what you see. For what you\nsee is merely HOW you elect to meet your goal.\n\nHallucinations serve to meet the goal of madness. They are the means\nby which the OUTSIDE world, projected from within, ADJUSTS to sin, and SEEMS to\nwitness to its reality. It still is true that nothing IS without. Yet, upon\nnothing, are ALL projections made. For it is the PROJECTION which gives the\n“nothing” ALL the meaning that it holds. What has NO meaning, cannot BE\nperceived. And meaning ALWAYS looks within, to find itself. And THEN looks out.\nALL meaning that you give the world outside, must thus reflect the sight you saw\nWITHIN. Or better, IF you saw at all, or merely judged AGAINST.\n\nVision is the means by which the Holy Spirit translates your\nnightmares into happy dreams; your wild hallucinations, that show you all fearful\noutcomes of imagined sin, into the calm and reassuring sights with which He would\nreplace them. These gentle sights and sounds are looked on happily, and heard\nwith joy. They are HIS substitutes for all the terrifying sights and screaming\nsounds the ego's purpose brought to your horrified awareness. They step AWAY from\nsin, reminding you that it is NOT reality that frightens you, and that the errors\nwhich you made CAN be corrected.\n\nWhen you have looked on what seemed terrifying, and SEEN it change to\nsights of loveliness and peace; when you have looked on scenes of violence and\ndeath, and WATCHED them change to quiet views of gardens under open skies, with\nclear life-giving water running happily beside them in dancing brooks that never\nwaste away; who need PERSUADE you to accept the gift of vision? And AFTER vision,",

    "content": "The Imagined World\n\nNever forget the world the sightless “see” MUST be imagined. And what\nit REALLY looks like IS unknown to them. They must infer what COULD be seen, from\nevidence forever indirect, and RECONSTRUCT their inferences as they stumble and\nfall because of what they did NOT recognize, or walk unharmed through open\ndoorways that they THOUGHT were closed. And so it is with\nyou. You do NOT see. Your cues for inference are wrong, and so you stumble and\nfall down upon the stones you did not recognize. But fail to be aware you CAN go\nthrough the doors you THOUGHT were closed, but which stand open before unseeing\neyes, waiting to WELCOME you.\n\nHow foolish it is to attempt to judge what could be seen instead. It\nis not necessary to IMAGINE what the world must look like. It must be SEEN,\nbefore you recognize it for what it is. You can be SHOWN which doors are open,\nand you can SEE where safety lies. And which way leads to darkness; which to\nlight. Judgment will ALWAYS give you false directions. But vision SHOWS you where\nto go. Why should you guess? There is no NEED to learn through pain. And gentle\nlessons are acquired joyously, and are remembered gladly. What gives you\nhappiness you WANT to learn, and NOT forget.\n\nIt is not this you would deny. YOUR question is whether the means by\nwhich this course is learned WILL bring the joy it promises. If you BELIEVED it\nwould, the LEARNING of it would be NO problem. You are not happy learners yet,\nbecause you still remain uncertain that vision gives you MORE than judgment does,\nand you HAVE learned that both you CANNOT have. The blind become ACCUSTOMED to\ntheir world by their adjustments TO it. They think they know their way about in\nit. They learned it not through joyous lessons, but through the stern necessity\nof limits they believed they could not overcome. And, STILL believing this, they\nhold those lessons dear, and cling to them BECAUSE they cannot see.\n\nThey do not understand the lessons KEEP them blind. This they do NOT\nbelieve. And so they keep the world they learned to\n“see” in their imagination, believing that their choice is that, or nothing. They\nhate the world they learned through pain. And everything they think is in it,\nserves to remind them that THEY are incomplete and bitterly deprived. Thus they\nDEFINE their life and where they live it, ADJUSTING to it as they think they\nmust, afraid to lose the little that they have. And so it is with all who see the\nbody as all they have, and all their brothers have. They try to reach each other,\nand they fail. And fail again. And they ADJUST to loneliness, believing that to\nKEEP the body is to SAVE the little that they have.\n\nListen, and try to think if you remember what we will speak of now.\nListen, -- perhaps you catch a hint of an ancient state not quite forgotten; dim,\nperhaps, and yet not altogether unfamiliar. Like a song whose name is long\nforgotten, and the circumstances in which you heard completely unremembered. Not\nthe whole song has stayed with you, but just a little wisp of melody, attached\nnot to a person or a place, or anything particular. But you remember, from just\nthis little part, how lovely was the song, how wonderful the setting where you\nheard it, and how you loved those who were there, and listened with you.\n\nThe notes are nothing; yet you have kept them with you, not for\nthemselves, but as a soft reminder of what would make you weep, if you remembered\nhow dear it was to you. You COULD remember, yet you are afraid, believing you\nwould lose the world you learned since then. And yet you know that nothing in the\nworld you learned is half so dear as this. Listen, and see if you remember an\nancient song you knew so long ago, and held more\ndear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since. Beyond the body,\nbeyond the sun and stars, past EVERYTHING you see and yet somehow familiar, is an\narc of golden light that stretches, as you look, into a great and shining circle.\nAnd all the circle fills with light before your eyes.\n\nThe edges of the circle disappear, and what is in it no longer is\ncontained at all. The light expands and covers everything, extending to infinity,\nforever shining, and with no break or limit anywhere. Within it, EVERYTHING is\njoined in perfect continuity. Nor is it possible to imagine that anything COULD\nbe outside. For there IS nowhere that this light is not. This is the vision of\nthe Son of God, whom you know well. Here is the sight of him who knows his\nFather. Here is the memory of what you ARE; a PART of this, with ALL of it within\nyou, and JOINED to all of it as surely as all is joined to you.\n\nACCEPT the vision that can show you this, and NOT the body. You KNOW\nthe ancient song, and know it well. Nothing will ever be as dear to you as is\nthis ancient hymn of love the Son of God sings to his Father still. And now the\nblind can see, for that same song they sing in honor of their Creator, gives\npraise to them as well. The blindness that they made will not withstand the\nmemory of this song. And they will look upon the vision of the Son of God,",

    "content": "The Responsibility for Sight\n\nWe have repeated how little is asked of you to learn this course. It\nis the same small willingness you need to have your whole relationship\ntransformed to joy. The LITTLE gift you offer to the Holy Spirit, for which He\ngives you EVERYTHING. The very little, on which salvation rests. The tiny change\nof mind by which the crucifixion is changed to Resurrection. And, being true, it\nis so simple that it cannot fail to be COMPLETELY understood. Rejected, yes, but\nNOT ambiguous. And, if you choose AGAINST it now, it will NOT be because it is\nobscure, but rather that this LITTLE cost seemed, in YOUR judgment, to be TOO\nMUCH to pay for peace.\n\nThis is the ONLY thing that you need do for vision, happiness, release\nfrom pain, and the COMPLETE escape from sin, ALL to be given you. Say ONLY this,\nbut MEAN it with NO reservations, for here the power of salvation lies:\n“I AM responsible for what I see. I CHOSE the feelings I experience, and I\nDECIDED ON the goal I would achieve. And everything that SEEMS to happen TO me, I\nASKED FOR and received as I had asked.”\nDeceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what is done TO\nyou. Acknowledge but that YOU have been mistaken, and ALL effects of your\nmistakes will disappear.\n\nIt is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events OUTSIDE\nhim. It is impossible that the happenings that come to him were NOT his choice.\nHis power of decision is the DETERMINER of every situation in which he seems to\nFIND himself by chance or accident. No accident or chance is POSSIBLE within the\nuniverse as God created it, OUTSIDE of which is nothing. Suffer, and YOU decided\nsin was your goal. Be happy, and you GAVE the power of decision to Him Who MUST\ndecide for God for you. This is the little gift you offer to the Holy Spirit, and\neven this He gave to you to give yourself. For, BY this gift ,is given you the\npower to release your Savior, that HE\nmay give salvation unto YOU.\n\nBegrudge not, then, this little offering. WITHHOLD it, and you keep\nthe world as now you see it. GIVE IT AWAY, and everything YOU see goes with it.\nNever was so much given for so little. In the holy instant is this exchange\neffected and MAINTAINED. Here is the world you do NOT want, brought to the one\nyou DO. And here the one you do is GIVEN you, BECAUSE you want it. But, for this,\nthe POWER of your wanting must first be RECOGNIZED. You must accept its STRENGTH,\nand NOT its weakness. You must perceive that what is strong enough to MAKE a\nworld, can let it go. And CAN accept correction, if it is willing to see that it\nwas wrong.\n\nThe world you see is but the idle witness that you were RIGHT. This\nwitness is insane. You trained it in its testimony, and, as it gave it BACK to\nyou, you listened and convinced yourself that what it saw was true. YOU DID THIS\nTO YOURSELF. See only this, and you will also see how circular the reasoning on\nwhich your “seeing” rests. This was NOT given you. This was your GIFT to you AND\nTO YOUR BROTHER. Be willing, then, to have it taken FROM him, and be replaced\nwith truth. And, as you look upon the change in HIM, it will be given you to see\nit in YOURSELF.\n\nPerhaps you do not see the need for you to give this little offering.\nLook closer, then, at what it IS. And, very simply, see in it the whole exchange\nof separation for salvation. All that the ego is, is an idea that it is possible\nthat things should HAPPEN to the Son of God, WITHOUT his will. And thus,\nwithout the Will of his Creator, Whose Will cannot BE separated from his own.\nThis is the Son of God's REPLACEMENT for his will, a mad revolt against what must\nforever be. This is the statement that he HAS the power to make God powerLESS.\nAnd so to take it from HIMSELF, and leave himself WITHOUT what God has willed FOR\nhim.\n\nThis is the mad idea you have enshrined upon your altars, AND WHICH\nYOU WORSHIP. And anything that threatens this, seems to ATTACK your faith. For\nhere it is invested. Think not that you are faithless, for your belief and trust\nin THIS is strong indeed. The Holy Spirit can GIVE you faith in holiness, and\nvision to see it, easily enough. But you have not left open and unoccupied the\naltar where the gift belongs. Where THEY should be, YOU have set up your idols to\nsomething ELSE. This OTHER will, which seems to TELL you what must happen, you\nGAVE reality. And what would SHOW you otherwise must therefore seem unreal.\n\nAll that is asked of you is to MAKE ROOM for truth. You are NOT asked\nto make or do what lies BEYOND your understanding. All you are asked to do is LET\nIT IN. Only to stop your INTERFERENCE with what will happen OF ITSELF. Simply to\nrecognize again the presence of what you THOUGHT you gave away. Be willing, for\nan instant, to leave your altars free of what YOU placed upon them and what is\nREALLY there you CANNOT fail to see. The holy instant is NOT an instant of\ncreation, but of RECOGNITION. For recognition comes of vision and SUSPENDED\njudgment. Then only is it possible to look within and see what MUST be there,\nplainly in sight, and wholly INDEPENDENT of inference and judgment.\n\nUndoing is not YOUR task, but it IS up to you to welcome it or not.\nFaith and desire go hand in hand. For everyone believes in what he wants. We have\nalready said that wishful thinking is how the ego deals with what it wants, to\nmake it so. There is no better demonstration of the power of wanting, and\ntherefore of FAITH, to make its goals seem real and possible. Faith in the UNreal\nleads to ADJUSTMENTS of reality, to make it fit the goal of madness. The goal of\nsin induces the perception of a fearful world, to JUSTIFY its purpose. What you\ndesire, you WILL see. And if its reality is false, you will UPHOLD it by NOT\nrealizing all the adjustments YOU have introduced, to MAKE it so.\n\nWhen vision is DENIED, confusion of cause and effect becomes\ninevitable. The PURPOSE now becomes to KEEP OBSCURE the cause of the effect, and\nmake effect appear to BE a cause. This seeming independence of effect enables it\nto be regarded as STANDING BY ITSELF, and capable of serving as a CAUSE of the\nevents and feelings its maker thinks IT causes. Long ago, we spoke of your desire\nto create your own Creator, and be father and not Son to Him. This is the same\ndesire. The Son is the effect, whose Cause he would deny. And so he seems to BE\nthe cause, producing real EFFECTS.\n\nNothing can have effects WITHOUT a cause, and to confuse the two is\nmerely to fail to understand them both. It is as needful that you recognize you\nMADE the world you see, as that you recognize that you did NOT create yourself.\nTHEY ARE THE SAME MISTAKE. Nothing created NOT by your Creator, has ANY influence\nover you. And if you think what YOU have made can TELL you what you see and feel,\nand place your faith in its ability to do so, you ARE denying your Creator, and\nBELIEVING that you made yourself. For, if you think the world you made has power\nto make you what IT wills, you ARE confusing Son and Father; effect and Source.\n\nThe Son's creations ARE like his Father's. But, in creating THEM, the\nSon does not delude himself that he is INDEPENDENT of his Source. His union with\nIt is the SOURCE of his creating. APART from this, he HAS no power to create, and\nwhat he makes is meaningless. It changes NOTHING in creation, depends ENTIRELY\nupon the madness of its maker, and can NOT serve to justify the madness. Your\nbrother thinks he made the world with you. Thus he denies creation. With you, he\nthinks the world he made, made HIM. Thus he denies he MADE it.\n\nYet the truth is you were both created by a loving Father, Who created\nyou together and as one. SEE what “proves” otherwise, and you DENY your whole\nreality. But grant that EVERYTHING that seems to stand BETWEEN you, keeping you\nfrom each other and separate from your Father, YOU MADE IN SECRET, and the\ninstant of release has come to you. ALL its effects are gone, because its source\nhas been uncovered. It is its seeming INDEPENDENCE of its source that kept you\nprisoner. This IS the same delusion that YOU are independent of the Source by\nwhich YOU were created, and have never left.",

    "content": "Faith, Belief and Vision\n\nAll special relationships have sin as their goal. For they are\nBARGAINS with reality, toward which the seeming union is adjusted. Forget not\nthis; to bargain is to set a limit, and any brother with whom you have a limited\nrelationship YOU HATE. You may attempt to KEEP the bargain in the name of\nfairness, sometimes demanding payment of your self, perhaps more often of the\nother. And in this “fairness,” you attempt to ease the guilt that comes from the\naccepted PURPOSE of the relationship. And that is why the Holy Spirit must change\nits purpose, to make it useful unto HIM, and harmless unto YOU.\n\nIf you ACCEPT this change, you have accepted the IDEA of making room\nfor truth. The SOURCE of sin is gone. You may IMAGINE that you still experience\nits effects, but it is NOT your purpose. And you no longer WANT it. No-one allows\na purpose to be REPLACED while he DESIRES it. For nothing is so cherished and\nprotected, as is a goal the mind accepts. This it will follow, grimly or happily,\nbut ALWAYS with faith, and with the persistence that faith INEVITABLY brings. The\npower of faith is NEVER recognized, if it is placed in sin. But it is ALWAYS\nrecognized, if it is placed in love.\n\nWhy is it strange to you that faith can move mountains? This is indeed\na little feat for such a power. For faith can keep the Son of God in chains, as\nlong as he believes he IS in chains. And, when he is RELEASED from them, it will\nbe simply because he no longer BELIEVES in them, WITHDRAWING faith that they can\nhold him, and placing it in his freedom INSTEAD. It is impossible to\nplace equal faith in opposite directions. What faith you give to sin, you TAKE\nAWAY from holiness. And what you offer holiness, has been REMOVED from sin.\n\nFaith and belief and vision are the means by which the goal of\nholiness is reached. Through them, the Holy Spirit leads you to the real world,\nand AWAY from all illusions where your faith was laid. This is HIS direction, the\nonly one He ever sees. And, when you wander, He REMINDS you there IS but one. HIS\nfaith and HIS belief and vision, are all for you. And, when you have accepted\nthem completely, INSTEAD of yours, you will have need of them no longer. For\nfaith and vision and belief are meaningful only BEFORE the state of certainty is\nreached. In Heaven they are unknown. Yet Heaven is REACHED through them.\n\nIt is impossible that the Son of God LACK faith. But he CAN choose\nwhere he would have it BE. Faithlessness is not a lack of FAITH, but faith in\nNOTHING. Faith given to illusions does NOT lack power, for, BY it, does the Son\nof God believe that he is powerless. Thus is he faithless to HIMSELF, but STRONG\nin faith in his illusions ABOUT himself. For faith, perception, and belief YOU\nmade, as means for LOSING certainty, and finding sin. This mad direction was your\nCHOICE, and by your FAITH in what you chose, you made what you desired.\n\nThe Holy Spirit has a use for all the means for sin by which you\nsought to FIND it. But, as HE uses them, they lead AWAY from sin, because His\nPURPOSE lies in the OPPOSITE direction. He sees the MEANS you use, but NOT the\npurpose for which you made them. He would not take them FROM you, for He sees\ntheir value as a means for what HE wills for you. You made perception, that\nyou might choose among your brothers, and seek for sin with them. The Holy Spirit\nsees perception as a means to teach you that the vision of a HOLY relationship is\nall you WANT to see.\n\nThen will you give your faith to holiness, desiring and BELIEVING in\nit, BECAUSE of your desire. Faith and belief become ATTACHED to vision, as all\nthe means that once served sin are REDIRECTED now toward holiness. For what you\nthink is sin is LIMITATION; and whom you try to limit to the body YOU HATE\nBECAUSE YOU FEAR. In your refusal to forgive him, you would CONDEMN him to the\nbody, because the means for sin is dear to you. And so the BODY has your faith\nand your belief. But HOLINESS would set your brother free, removing hatred by\nremoving fear, NOT as a symptom, but at its source.\n\nThose who would free their brothers from the body, can HAVE no fear.\nThey have renounced the means for sin, by choosing to let all limitations be\nREMOVED. Desiring to look upon their brothers in holiness, the power of belief\nand faith goes far BEYOND the body, SUPPORTING vision, NOT obstructing it. But\nfirst they chose to RECOGNIZE how much their faith had limited their\nunderstanding of the world, DESIRING to place its power elsewhere, should another\npoint of view be GIVEN them. The miracles that follow this decision, are also\nborn of faith. For all who choose to look AWAY from sin ARE given vision, and ARE\nled to holiness.\n\nThose who believe in sin MUST think the Holy Spirit asks for\nsacrifice. For this is how they think THEIR purpose is accomplished. Brothers,\nthe Holy Spirit KNOWS that sacrifice brings NOTHING. He makes no bargains. And if\nyou seek to limit Him, you will hate Him BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRAID. The gift that He\nhas given you is more than ANYTHING that stands this side of Heaven. The instant\nfor its recognition is at hand. Join your awareness to what has been ALREADY\njoined. The faith you give each other CAN accomplish this. For He Who LOVES the\nworld is seeing it FOR you, without one spot of sin upon it, and in the innocence\nwhich makes the sight of it as beautiful as Heaven.\n\nYour faith in sacrifice has given it great power in your sight. Except\nyou do not realize you CANNOT see, BECAUSE of it. For sacrifice MUST be exacted\nOF a body, and by ANOTHER body. The mind could neither ask it nor RECEIVE it of\nitself. And no more could the body.\nThe INTENTION is in the mind, which tries to USE the body to carry out the means\nfor sin, in which the MIND believes. Thus is the JOINING of mind and body an\nINESCAPABLE belief of those who value sin. And so is sacrifice INVARIABLY a means\nfor limitation. And thus for hate.\n\nThink you the Holy Spirit is concerned with THIS? He GIVES not what it\nis His purpose to lead you FROM. You THINK He would deprive you FOR YOUR GOOD.\nBut “good” and “deprivation” are opposites, and CANNOT meaningfully join in ANY\nway. It is like saying that the moon and sun are one BECAUSE they come with night\nand day. And so they MUST be joined. Yet sight of one is but the sign the other\nhas DISAPPEARED from sight. Nor is it possible that what GIVES light, be one with\nwhat DEPENDS on darkness to be seen. Neither demands the SACRIFICE of the other.\nYet on the ABSENCE of the other does each depend.\n\nThe body was made to BE a sacrifice to sin. And, in the darkness so it\nstill is seen. Yet in the light of vision it is looked upon quite differently.\nYou CAN have faith in it to serve the Holy Spirit's goal. And give it power to\nserve as means to help the blind to see. But, in their seeing, they look PAST it,\nas do you. The faith and the belief you gave it BELONG beyond. You gave\nperception and belief and faith from mind TO body. Let them now be given BACK to\nwhat PRODUCED them, and can use them still to SAVE itself from what it made.",

    "content": "The Fear to Look Within\n\nThe Holy Spirit will NEVER teach you that you are sinful. ERRORS He\nwill correct, but this makes no-one fearful. You are indeed afraid to look\nwithin, and see the sin you THINK is there. This you would NOT be fearful to\nadmit. Fear in association with sin the ego deems quite appropriate, and smiles\napprovingly. IT has no fear to let you feel ashamed. It doubts not your belief\nand faith in sin. Its temples do not shake because of THIS. Your faith that sin\nis there but witnesses your desire that it BE there to see. This merely SEEMS to\nbe the source of fear. Remember that the ego is NOT alone. Its rule IS tempered.\nAnd its unknown “Enemy,” Whom it cannot even see, it FEARS.\n\nLoudly the ego tells you NOT to look inward, for if you do, your eyes\nwill light on sin, and God will strike you blind. This you believe, and so you do\nNOT look. Yet this is NOT the ego's hidden fear, nor YOURS who serve it. Loudly\nindeed the ego claims it IS. TOO loudly and TOO often. For underneath this\nconstant shout and frantic proclamation, the ego is NOT certain it is so. Beneath\nyour fear to look within because of sin is yet ANOTHER fear, and one which makes\nthe ego tremble. What if you looked within, and saw NO sin? This “fearful”\nquestion is one the ego NEVER asks. And you who ask it now ARE “threatening” the\nego's whole defensive system too seriously for it to bother to PRETEND it is your\nfriend.\n\nThose who have joined their brothers HAVE detached themselves from\ntheir belief that their identity lies in the ego. A holy relationship is one in\nwhich you join with what IS part of you in TRUTH. And your belief in sin has been\nALREADY shaken, nor are you now ENTIRELY unwilling to look within and see it NOT.\nYour liberation still is only partial; still limited and incomplete, yet born\nWITHIN you. Not wholly mad, you HAVE been willing to look on much of your\ninsanity, and RECOGNIZE its madness.\nYour faith is moving inward, PAST insanity, and on to reason. And what your\nreason tells you now, the ego would not hear.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's purpose was accepted by the part of your mind the\nego knows not of. No more did YOU. And yet this part, with which you now\nidentify, is NOT afraid to look upon ITSELF. It KNOWS that it is sinless. How\notherwise COULD it have been willing to see the Holy Spirit's purpose as its own?\nThis part has seen your brother, and RECOGNIZED him perfectly, since time began.\nAnd it desired nothing but to JOIN with him, and to be free again, as once it\nwas. It has been waiting for the birth of freedom; the ACCEPTANCE of release to\ncome to you. And now you recognize that it was NOT the ego that joined the Holy\nSpirit's purpose, and so there MUST be something else.\n\nThink not that THIS is madness. For this your REASON tells you. And it\nfollows PERFECTLY from what you have ALREADY learned. There is NO inconsistency\nin what the Holy Spirit teaches. This is the reasoning of the SANE. You have\nperceived the EGO'S madness, and NOT been made afraid, because you did not choose\nto SHARE in it. At times it still deceives you. Yet, in your saner moments, its\nranting strikes no terror in your hearts. For you have realized that all the\ngifts it would withdraw from you in rage at your “presumptuous” wish to look\nwithin, you do not WANT. The few remaining trinkets still seem to shine and catch\nyour eye. Yet you would not “sell” Heaven to have them.\n\nAnd now the ego IS afraid. But what it hears in terror, the OTHER part\nhears as the sweetest music; the song it longed to hear since first the ego came\ninto your minds. The ego's weakness is ITS strength. The song of freedom, which\nsings the praises of ANOTHER world, brings to it hope of peace. For it REMEMBERS\nHeaven. And now it sees that Heaven HAS come to earth at last, from which the\nego's rule has kept it out so long. Heaven has come because it\nfound a home in your relationship on earth. And earth can hold no longer what has\nbeen GIVEN Heaven as its own.\n\nLook gently on each other, and remember the ego's WEAKNESS is revealed\nin BOTH your sight. What it would keep apart has met and joined, and looks upon\nthe ego unafraid. Little children, innocent of sin, follow in gladness the way to\ncertainty. Be not held back by fear's insane insistence that sureness lies in",

    "content": "Reason and Perception\n\nPerception selects, and MAKES the world you see. It literally PICKS IT\nOUT, as mind directs. The laws of size and shape and brightness would hold,\nperhaps, if other things were equal. They are NOT equal. For what you look FOR\nyou are far more likely to discover, REGARDLESS of its color, shape, or size,\nthan what you would prefer to OVERLOOK. The still small Voice for God ,is NOT\ndrowned out by all the ego's raucous screams and senseless ravings, to those who\nWANT to hear. Perception is a choice, and NOT a fact.\n\nBut on this choice depends far more than you may realize as yet. For,\non the voice you choose to hear, and on the sights you choose to see, depends\nENTIRELY your whole belief of what you ARE. Perception is a witness but to this,\nand never to reality. Yet it can show you the conditions in which AWARENESS of\nreality is possible, or those where it could NEVER be. Reality needs no\ncooperation from you, to be itself. But your awareness of it NEEDS your help,\nbecause it IS your choice.\n\nListen to what the ego says, and see what it DIRECTS you see, and it\nis sure that you will see YOURSELF as tiny, vulnerable, and afraid. You WILL\nexperience depression, a sense of worthlessness, and feelings of impermanence and\nunreality. You WILL believe that you are helpless prey to forces far beyond your\nown control, and far more powerful than you. And you WILL think the world you\nmade directs your destiny. For this will be your FAITH. But never believe,\nbecause it is your faith, it makes REALITY. There is ANOTHER vision and ANOTHER\nvoice, in which your freedom lies, awaiting but your choice. And, if you place\nyour faith in them, you will perceive ANOTHER Self in YOU.\n\nThis other self sees miracles as natural. They are as simple and as\nnatural to it as breathing to the body. They are the OBVIOUS response to calls\nfor help, the ONLY one it makes. Miracles seem unnatural to the ego, because it\ndoes not understand how SEPARATE minds can influence each other. Nor COULD they\ndo so. But minds cannot BE separate. This other self is PERFECTLY aware of this.\nAnd thus it recognizes that miracles do NOT affect ANOTHER'S mind, only its OWN.\nThey always change YOUR mind. There IS no other.\n\nYou do not realize the whole extent to which the idea of separation\nhas INTERFERED with reason. Reason lies in the other self you have CUT OFF from\nyour awareness. And nothing you have allowed to STAY in it is CAPABLE of reason.\nHow can the segment of the mind DEVOID of reason understand what reason IS? Or\ngrasp the information it would give? All sorts of QUESTIONS may arise in it, but,\nif the basic question stems from REASON, it will not ask it. Like ALL that stems\nfrom reason, the basic question is obvious, simple, and remains unasked. But\nthink not reason could not ANSWER it.\n\nGod's plan for your salvation could not have been established WITHOUT\nyour will and your consent. It MUST have been accepted by the Son of God, for\nwhat God wills for him, he MUST receive. For God wills not, apart from him. Nor\ndoes the Will of God wait upon time to be accomplished. Therefore, what JOINED\nthe Will of God MUST be in you NOW, being eternal. You MUST have set aside a\nplace in which the Holy Spirit can abide, and where He IS. He must HAVE BEEN\nthere since the need for Him arose, and was fulfilled in the same instant.\n\nSuch would your REASON tell you, if you listened. Yet such is clearly\nNOT the ego's “reasoning.” Its alien nature, TO THE EGO, is proof you will NOT\nfind the answer there. Yet if it MUST be so, it must exist. And, if it exists FOR\nyou, and has your freedom as the purpose GIVEN it, you MUST be\nfree to FIND it. God's plan is simple; NEVER circular, and NEVER Self-defeating.\nHe has no Thoughts except the Self-EXTENDING, and in this, YOUR will MUST be\nincluded. Thus there MUST be a part of you that KNOWS His Will and SHARES It.\n\nIt is NOT meaningful to ask if what MUST be is so. But it IS\nmeaningful to ask why you are UNAWARE of what is so. For this MUST have an\nanswer, if the plan of God for your salvation is complete. And it must BE\ncomplete, because its Source knows not of incompletion. Where would the answer\nBE, but in the Source? And where are YOU but there, where this same Answer is?\nYour identity, as much a true EFFECT of this same Source as is this Answer, must\ntherefore be TOGETHER and the SAME.\n\nOh yes, you know this. And more than this alone. But any part of\nknowledge threatens dissociation as much as ALL of it. And all of it will COME\nwith any part. Here is the part you CAN accept. What reason points to, you CAN\nsee, because the witnesses on its behalf ARE clear. Only the TOTALLY insane can\ndisregard them. And you HAVE gone past this. Reason is a means which serves the\nHoly Spirit's purpose in its OWN right. It is not RE-INTERPRETED and REDIRECTED\nfrom the goal of sin, as are the others. For reason is BEYOND the ego's range of\nmeans.\n\nFaith and perception and belief can be misplaced, and serve the great\ndeceiver's needs, as well as truth. But reason has no place at all in madness,\nnor can it be ADJUSTED to fit its ends. Faith and belief are STRONG in madness,\nguiding perception toward what the mind has valued. But reason enters NOT AT ALL\nin this. For the perception would fall away at once, if reason were applied.\nThere IS no reason in insanity, for it depends ENTIRELY on reason's absence. The\nego NEVER uses it, because it does not realize that it EXISTS.\n\nThe partially insane HAVE access to it. And only they have NEED of it.\nKNOWLEDGE does not depend on it, and madness keeps it OUT. The part of mind where\nreason lies was dedicated, by your will in union with your Father's, to\nthe UNDOING of insanity. Here was the Holy Spirit's purpose accepted and\naccomplished, both at once. Reason is ALIEN to insanity, and those who use it\nhave gained a means which cannot BE applied to sin. Knowledge is far beyond\nattainment of ANY kind. But reason CAN serve to open doors you closed AGAINST it.\n\nYou have come very close to this. Faith and belief have shifted, and\nyou HAVE asked the question that the ego will NEVER ask. Does not your reason\ntell you now the question MUST have come from something that you do NOT know, but\nmust BELONG to you? Faith and belief, upheld by reason, CANNOT fail to lead to",

    "content": "Reason and Corrections\n\nReason cannot see sin, but CAN see errors, and LEADS to their\ncorrection. It does not value THEM, but their CORRECTION. But reason will also\ntell you when you THINK you sin you call for help, but if you will not ACCEPT the\nhelp you call for, you will not believe that it is yours to give. And so you WILL\nnot give it, thus MAINTAINING the belief. For uncorrected error of ANY kind\ndeceives you about the power that is IN you, to MAKE correction. If it CAN\ncorrect, and YOU allow it not to do so, you deny it to yourself AND TO YOUR\nBROTHER. And, if he SHARES this same belief, you BOTH will think that you are\ndamned.\n\nThis you COULD spare him AND YOURSELF. For reason would not make way\nfor correction in you alone. Correction cannot BE accepted OR REFUSED by you,\nwithout your brother. SIN would maintain you can. But reason tells you that you\nCANNOT see your brother OR yourself as sinful, and still perceive the other\ninnocent. Who looks upon himself as guilty, and sees a sinless world? And who can\nsee a sinful world, and look upon himself APART from it? Sin would maintain you\nMUST be separate. But REASON tells you that this must be WRONG.\n\nIf you are joined, how COULD it be that you have private thoughts? And\nhow COULD thoughts that enter into what but SEEMS like yours alone, have no\neffect at all on what IS yours? If minds are joined, this IS impossible. No-one\ncan think but for himself, as God thinks not without His Son. Only were both IN\nBODIES could this be. Nor could one mind think only for itself, unless the body\nWERE the mind. For ONLY bodies can be separate, and therefore UNREAL. The home of\nmadness CANNOT be the home of reason. Yet it is easy to LEAVE the home of\nmadness, if you see reason.\n\nYou do not leave insanity by GOING somewhere else. You leave it simply\nby accepting reason, where madness WAS. Madness and reason see the same things,\nbut it is certain that they look upon them differently. Madness is an ATTACK on\nreason, that drives it out of mind, and TAKES ITS PLACE. Reason does NOT\nattack, but takes the place of madness quietly, REPLACING madness if it be the\nwill of the insane to LISTEN to it. But the insane know not their will. For they\nBELIEVE they see the body, and LET their madness tell them it is real. REASON\nwould be INCAPABLE of this. And, if you would defend the body AGAINST your\nreason, you will not understand the body OR yourself.\n\nThe body does NOT separate you from your brother. And, if you think it\ndoes, you ARE insane. But madness has a purpose, and believes it also has the\nmeans to make its purpose real. To see the body as a barrier between what REASON\ntells you MUST be joined, MUST be insane. Nor COULD you see it, if you heard the\nvoice of reason. What CAN there be that stands BETWEEN what is continuous? And,\nif there IS nothing in between, how can what enters part be kept AWAY from other\nparts? Reason would tell you this. But think what you must RECOGNIZE, if it be\nso. If you choose sin INSTEAD of healing, you would condemn the Son of God to\nwhat can NEVER be corrected.\n\nYou tell him, BY your choice, that he is damned; separate from you and\nfrom his Father, forever and without a hope of safe return. You TEACH him this,\nand you will LEARN of him EXACTLY what you taught. For you can teach him only\nthat he IS as you would HAVE him. And what you chose he be, is but your choice\nfor YOU. Yet think not this is fearful. That you are JOINED to him is but a fact,\nNOT an interpretation. How can a fact be fearful, unless it DISAGREES with what\nyou hold more dear than truth? Reason will tell you that this fact is your\nRELEASE. Neither your brother nor yourself can be attacked alone. But neither can\naccept a miracle instead, WITHOUT the other being blessed by it, and HEALED of\npain.\n\nReason, like love, would REASSURE you, and NOT seek to frighten you.\nThe power to HEAL the Son of God is given you, BECAUSE he MUST be one with you.\nYou ARE responsible for how he sees himself. But reason tells you it is GIVEN you\nto change his whole mind, which is one with YOU, in just an instant. And ANY\ninstant serves to bring COMPLETE correction of his errors, and make him whole.\nThe instant that you choose to let YOURSELF be healed, in that\nsame instant is his whole salvation seen as complete WITH yours. Reason is given\nyou to UNDERSTAND that this is so. For reason, kind as is the purpose for which\nit is the means, leads steadily AWAY from madness, toward the goal of truth.\n\nAnd here you will lay down the burden of DENYING truth. THIS is the\nburden that is terrible, and NOT the truth. That you are JOINED is your\nsalvation; the gift of Heaven, NOT the gift of fear. Does Heaven seem to be a\nBURDEN to you? In madness, yes; and yet what madness sees, MUST be dispelled by\nreason. Reason assures you Heaven is what you WANT, and ALL you want. Listen to\nHim Who SPEAKS with reason, and brings YOUR reason in line with HIS. Be willing\nto let reason be the means by which He would direct you how to leave INSANITY\nbehind. Hide not BEHIND insanity, in order to ESCAPE from reason.\n\nWhat madness would CONCEAL, the Holy Spirit still holds out, for\neveryone to look upon with gladness. You ARE your brother's Savior. He is YOURS.\nReason speaks happily indeed of this. This gracious plan was given love by Love.\nAnd what Love plans is like Itself in this: Being united, It would have you learn\nwhat YOU must be. And being ONE with It, it MUST be given you to give what IT has\ngiven, and gives still. Spend but an instant in the glad ACCEPTANCE of what is\ngiven you to give your brother, and learn, with him, what has been given BOTH of\nyou.\n\nTo give is no MORE blessed than to receive. But neither is it LESS.\nThe Son of God is ALWAYS blessed as one. And, as his gratitude goes out to you\nwho blessed him, reason will tell you that it CANNOT be you stand APART from\nblessing. The gratitude he offers you reminds you of the thanks your Father gives\nyou for completing HIM. And here alone does reason tell you that you can\nunderstand what you MUST be. Your Father is as close to you as is your brother.\nYet what is there that could be nearer you, than is your Self?\n\nThe power that YOU have over the Son of God is NOT a threat to his\nreality. It but ATTESTS to it. Where COULD his freedom lie but in himself, if he\nbe free ALREADY? And who could bind him but HIMSELF, if he DENY his freedom? God\nis not mocked; no more His Son can BE imprisoned, save by his own desire. And it\nis BY his own desire that he is freed. Such is his STRENGTH, and NOT his",

    "content": "Perception and Wishes\n\nDo you not see that all your misery comes from the strange belief that\nyou are powerless? BEING HELPLESS IS THE COST OF SIN. Helplessness is sin's\nCONDITION; the ONE requirement that it demands, to be believed. Only the helpless\nCOULD believe in it. Enormity has no appeal, save to the little. And only those\nwho FIRST believe that they are little, could SEE attraction there. Treachery to\nthe Son of God is the defense of those who do NOT identify with him. And you are\nFOR him or AGAINST him; either you love him or attack him; protect his unity, or\nsee him shattered and slain by your attack.\n\nNo-one believes the Son of God is powerless. And those who see\nthemselves as helpless MUST believe that they are NOT the Son of God. What can\nthey BE, except his enemy? And what can they do but ENVY him his power, and BY\ntheir envy, make themselves AFRAID of it? These are the dark ones, silent and\nafraid, alone and not communicating, fearful the power of the Son of God will\nstrike them dead, and raising up their helplessness AGAINST him. They join the\narmy of the powerless, to wage their war of vengeance, bitterness, and spite on\nhim, to make him one with THEM.\n\nBecause they do not know that they are one with HIM, they know not\nWHOM they hate. They are indeed a sorry army, each one as likely to attack his\nbrother or turn upon himself, as to remember they THOUGHT they had a common\ncause. Frantic and loud and strong the dark ones SEEM to be. Yet they know not\ntheir enemy, EXCEPT THEY HATE HIM. In hatred they HAVE come together, but have\nNOT joined EACH OTHER. For, had they done so, hatred would be impossible. The\narmy of the powerless MUST be disbanded in the presence of STRENGTH.\n\nThose who are strong are NEVER treacherous, because they have no need\nto DREAM of power, and to act out their dream. How would an army ACT in dreams?\nAny way at all. They could be seen attacking ANYONE, with ANYTHING. Dreams have\nno REASON in them. A flower turns into a poisoned spear, a child becomes a giant,\nand a mouse roars like a lion. And LOVE IS TURNED TO HATE as easily. This is no\narmy, but a madhouse. What SEEMS to be a planned attack is bedlam. The army of\nthe powerless is weak indeed. It has no weapons, and it has no enemy.\n\nYes, it can overrun the world, and SEEK an enemy. But it can never\nFIND what is not there. Yes, it can DREAM it found an enemy, but this will shift\neven as it attacks, so that it runs at once to find another, and never comes to\nrest in victory. And, as it runs, it turns against itself, thinking it caught a\nglimpse of the great enemy that always eludes its murderous attack by turning\ninto someone else. How treacherous does this enemy appear, who changes so, it is\nimpossible even to RECOGNIZE him! Yet hate MUST have a target. There can BE no\nfaith in sin without an enemy.\n\nWho that believes in sin would DARE believe he has NO enemy? COULD he\nadmit that no-one MADE him powerless? Reason would surely bid him seek no longer\nwhat is NOT THERE to find. Yet first he must be WILLING to perceive a world where\nit is NOT. It is NOT necessary that he understand HOW he can see it. Nor should\nhe try. For, if he focuses on what he CANNOT understand, he will but EMPHASIZE\nhis helplessness, and let sin tell him his enemy must be HIMSELF. But let him\nonly ask himself these questions, which he MUST decide to have it done FOR him:\n\n“Do I DESIRE a world I rule, instead of one where I AM ruled?\n\nDo I DESIRE a world where I am powerful, instead of helpless?\n\nDo I DESIRE a world in which I have NO enemies, and CANNOT sin?\n\nAnd do I WANT to see what I denied, BECAUSE it is the truth?”\n\nYou have ALREADY answered the first three questions, but not yet the\nlast. For this one still seems fearful, and UNLIKE the others. Yet reason would\nassure you they are all the SAME. We said this year would emphasize the sameness\nof things that ARE the same. This final question which is indeed the last you\nneed decide, still seems to hold a threat the rest have lost for you. And this\nimagined difference attests to your belief that TRUTH may be the enemy you yet\nmay find. Here, then, would seem to be the last remaining hope of finding sin,\nand NOT accepting power.\n\nForget not that the choice of truth or sin, power or helplessness, IS\nthe choice of whether to attack or HEAL. For healing comes of POWER, and ATTACK\nof helplessness. Whom you attack, you CANNOT want to heal. And whom you would\nhave healed, MUST be the one you chose to be PROTECTED from attack. And what IS\nthis decision, but the choice whether to see him through the body's eyes, or let\nhim be REVEALED to you through vision? HOW this decision leads to its effects is\nNOT your problem. But what you WANT to see, MUST be your choice. This is a course\nin CAUSE, and NOT effect.\n\nConsider carefully your answer to the last question you have left\nunanswered still. And let your reason tell you that it MUST be answered, and IS\nanswered in the other three. And then it WILL be clear to you that, as you look\non the EFFECTS of sin, in ANY form, all you need do is simply ask yourself, “Is\nthis what I WOULD see? Do I WANT this?” This is your one decision; this the\nCONDITION for what occurs. It IS irrelevant to HOW it happens, but NOT to WHY.\nYou HAVE control of this. And if you CHOOSE to see a world WITHOUT an enemy, in\nwhich you are NOT helpless, the MEANS to see it WILL be given you.\n\nWhy is the final question so important? Reason will tell you why. It\nIS the same as are the other three, EXCEPT IN TIME. The others are decisions\nwhich can be made, and then UNmade, and made again. But truth is CONSTANT, and\nimplies a state where vacillations are impossible. You can desire a world you\nrule, which rules you not, and CHANGE your mind. You can desire to exchange your\nhelplessness for power, and LOSE this same desire as a little glint of sin\nattracts you. And you can want to see a sinless world, and let an “enemy” tempt\nyou to use the body's eyes, and CHANGE what you desire.\n\nIn CONTENT all the questions ARE the same. For each one asks if you\nare willing to exchange the world of sin for what the Holy Spirit sees. For it IS\nthis the world of sin denies. And therefore those who look on sin ARE seeing the\nDENIAL of the real world. Yet the last question adds the WISH FOR CONSTANCY in\nyour desire to see the real world, so the desire becomes the ONLY one you have.\nBy answering the final question “yes,” you add SINCERITY to the decisions that\nyou have ALREADY made to all the rest. For only then have you RENOUNCED the\noption to change your mind AGAIN. When it is THIS you do NOT want, the rest are\nreally answered.\n\nWhy do you think you are unsure the others HAVE been answered? COULD\nit be necessary they be ASKED so often, if they HAD? Until the last decision has\nbeen made, the answer IS both yes and no. For you HAVE answered “yes,” without\nperceiving that yes MUST mean NOT NO. No-one decides AGAINST his happiness. But\nhe MAY do so, if he does not know he DOES it. And, if he sees his happiness as\never-changing, now this, now that, and now an elusive shadow attached to nothing,\nhe DOES decide against it.\n\nElusive happiness, or happiness in changing forms that shift with time\nand place, is an illusion that has no meaning. Happiness MUST be constant,\nbecause it is ATTAINED by GIVING UP the wish for the INconstant. Joy cannot BE\nperceived, EXCEPT through constant vision. And constant\nvision can be given only those who WISH for constancy. The power of the Son of\nGod's desire remains the proof that he is wrong who sees himself as helpless.",

It is this DIFFERENCE, seen but not\nreal, that makes the need for sin, not real but seen, seem justified. And all\nthis WOULD be real, if sin were so. For an unholy relationship is BASED on\ndifferences, where each one thinks the OTHER has what HE has NOT.\n\nThey come together, each to complete HIMSELF and ROB the other. They\nstay until they think there's nothing left to steal, and then move on. And so\nthey wander through a world of strangers, UNLIKE themselves, living with their\nbodies perhaps beneath a common roof that shelters neither; in the same room and\nyet a world apart. A holy relationship starts from a different premise. Each one\nhas looked within, and seen NO lack. ACCEPTING his completion, he would EXTEND it\nby JOINING with another, whole as himself.\n\nHe sees NO DIFFERENCES between these selves, for differences are ONLY\nof the body. Therefore, he looks on nothing he would TAKE. He\ndenies NOT his own reality BECAUSE it is the truth. Just under Heaven does he\nstand, but close enough NOT to return to earth. For this relationship HAS\nHeaven's holiness. How far from home can a relationship so like to Heaven BE?\nThink what a holy relationship can teach! Here is BELIEF in differences undone.\nHere is the FAITH in differences shifted to sameness. And here is sight of\ndifferences transformed to VISION.\n\nAnd reason now can lead you to the logical conclusion of your union.\nIT must extend, as YOU extended when you joined. It must reach out BEYOND itself,\nas YOU reached out beyond the body, to LET yourselves be joined. And now the\nsameness which you saw extends, and finally removes ALL sense of differences, so",

    "content": "The Message of the Holy Relationship\n\nLet reason take another step. If you attack whom God would heal, and\nhate the one He loves, then you and your Creator have a DIFFERENT will. Yet, if\nyou ARE His Will, what you MUST then believe is that you are NOT yourself. You\ncan, indeed, believe this, and you DO. And you HAVE faith in this, and see much\nevidence on its behalf. And where, you wonder, does your strange uneasiness, your\nsense of being disconnected, and your haunting fear of lack of meaning in\nyourself arise? It is as though you wandered in, without a plan of any kind\nexcept to wander off, for only that seems certain.\n\nYet we have heard a very similar description earlier. But it was NOT\nof you. And yet, this strange idea which it DOES accurately describe, you think\nIS you. Reason would tell you that the world you see through eyes that are not\nyours, MUST make no sense to you. To whom would vision such as this send BACK its\nmessages? Surely not you, whose sight is wholly INDEPENDENT of the eyes which\nlook upon the world. If this is NOT your vision, what can it show to YOU? The\nbrain can NOT interpret what YOUR vision sees. This YOU would understand. The\nbrain interprets to the body, of which it is a part. But what IT says, YOU cannot\nunderstand.\n\nYet you have LISTENED to it. And long and hard you TRIED to understand\nits messages. You did not realize it is IMPOSSIBLE to understand what fails\nENTIRELY to REACH you. You have received NO messages at all you understood. For\nyou have listened to what can never communicate at all. Think, then, what\nhappened. Denying what you are, and firm in faith that you are something ELSE,\nthis something else, which you have MADE to be yourself, BECAME your sight. Yet\nit MUST be the SOMETHING ELSE which sees, and, as NOT YOU, explains its sight TO\nyou.\n\nYOUR vision would, of course, render this quite unnecessary. But, if\nyour eyes are closed, and you have called upon this thing to lead you, asking it\nto EXPLAIN to you the world IT sees, you have no reason NOT to listen, nor to\nsuspect that what it tells you is NOT true. Reason would tell you that it CAN'T\nbe true, BECAUSE you do not understand it. GOD HAS NO SECRETS. He does NOT lead\nyou through a world of misery, waiting\nto tell you, at the journey's end, why He DID this to you. What could be secret\nfrom His Will? Yet you believe that YOU have secrets. What could your secrets BE\nexcept ANOTHER will, that is your own, APART from His?\n\nReason would tell you that this is no SECRET, that need be hidden as a\nsin. But a MISTAKE indeed! Let not your fear of sin protect it from correction,\nfor the attraction of guilt is ONLY fear. Here is the ONE emotion that YOU made,\nWHATEVER it may seem to be. And it IS the emotion of secrecy, of private\nthoughts, AND OF THE BODY. This is the ONE emotion that opposes love, and ALWAYS\nleads to sight of differences, and LOSS of sense of sameness. Here is the ONE\nemotion that keeps you blind, dependent on the self you think you made, to lead\nyou through the world it made for you.\n\nYOUR sight was GIVEN you, along with everything that you CAN\nunderstand. You will perceive NO difficulty in understanding what this vision\ntells you. For everyone sees ONLY what he thinks he IS. And what YOUR sight will\nshow you, you will understand BECAUSE it is the truth. Only YOUR vision can\nconvey to YOU what YOU can see. It reaches you directly, WITHOUT a need to be\nINTERPRETED to you. What NEEDS interpretation MUST be alien. Nor will it EVER be\nmade understandable, by an interpreter you cannot understand. Of all the messages\nyou have received and failed to understand, this course alone is OPEN to your\nunderstanding, and CAN be understood.\n\nThis IS your language. You do not understand it yet, only because your\nwhole communication is like a baby's. The sounds a baby makes, and what he hears,\nare highly unreliable, meaning DIFFERENT things to him at different times.\nNeither the sounds he hears, nor sights he sees, are stable yet. Yet what he\nhears and does not understand WILL BE his native tongue, through which he will\ncommunicate with those around him, and they with him. And the strange, shifting\nones he sees about him will become to him his comforters, and he will recognize\nhis home, and see them there WITH him.\n\nSo, in each holy relationship, is the ability to communicate INSTEAD\nof separate reborn. Yet a holy relationship, so recently reborn itself from an\nunholy relationship, and yet more ancient than the old illusion that it has\nreplaced, IS like a baby now, in its rebirth. Yet, in this infant is YOUR vision\nreturned to you, and he will speak the language BOTH of you can understand. He is\nnot nurtured by the “something else” you THOUGHT was you. He was not GIVEN there,\nnor was received by anything EXCEPT yourself. For no two people CAN unite EXCEPT\nthrough Christ, Whose vision sees them one.\n\nThink what is GIVEN you, my holy brothers. This child will teach you\nwhat you do not understand, and make it plain. For his will be no alien tongue.\nHe will need NO interpreter to you. For it was YOU who taught him what he knows,\nBECAUSE you knew it. He could not come to anything BUT you, NEVER to something\nelse. Where Christ has entered, no-one is alone, for never could He find a home\nin separate ones. Yet must He be reborn into His ancient home, so seeming new and\nyet as old as He, a tiny newcomer, dependent on the holiness of your\nrelationship, to let Him live.\n\nBe certain that God does not entrust His Son to the unworthy. Nothing\nbut what is PART of Him is worthy of BEING joined. Nor is it possible that\nanything NOT part of Him CAN join. Communication MUST have been restored to those\nthat join, for this they COULD not do through bodies. What, then, HAS joined\nthem? Reason will tell you that they MUST have seen each other through a vision\nNOT of the body, and communicated in a language the body does not speak. Nor\ncould it be a fearful sight or sound that drew them gently into one. Rather, in\neach, the other saw a perfect shelter where his Self could be reborn in safety\nand in peace. Such did his reason tell him; such he believed BECAUSE it is the\ntruth.\n\nHere is the first DIRECT perception that you have made. You made it\nthrough awareness older than perception, and yet reborn in just an instant. For\nwhat is time to what was ALWAYS so? Think what that instant brought; the\nRECOGNITION that the “something else” you thought was you\nIS AN ILLUSION. And truth came instantly to show you where your self MUST be. It\nis denial of ILLUSIONS that calls on truth. For to deny illusions is to recognize\nthat FEAR is meaningless. Into the holy home where fear is powerless, love enters\nthankfully, grateful that it is one with you who joined to LET it enter.\n\nChrist comes to what is LIKE Himself; the same, NOT different. For He\nis ALWAYS drawn unto Himself. What is as like Him as a holy relationship? And\nwhat draws YOU together, draws HIM to you. Here is His sweetness, and His gentle\ninnocence PROTECTED from attack. And here can He RETURN in confidence, for faith\nin one another is ALWAYS faith in Him. You are indeed correct in looking on each\nother as His chosen home. For here you willed WITH Him and with His Father. This",

    "content": "Your Brother's Sinlessness\n\nThe OPPOSITE of illusions is not disillusionment, but truth. Only to\nthe ego, to which TRUTH is meaningless, do they APPEAR to be the only\nalternatives, and DIFFERENT from each other. In truth, they are the SAME. Both\nbring the same amount of misery, though each one SEEMS to be the way to lose the\nmisery the other brings. EVERY illusion carries pain and suffering in the dark\nfolds of the heavy garments with which it hides its nothingness. Yet, in these\ndark and heavy garments, are those who SEEK illusions covered, and hidden from\nthe joy of truth. Truth is the opposite of illusions, BECAUSE it offers joy.\n\nWhat else BUT joy could be the opposite of misery? To leave one kind\nof misery and seek another, is hardly an ESCAPE. To change ILLUSIONS is to make\nNO change. The search for joy IN MISERY is senseless. For how COULD joy be found\nin misery? All that is possible in the dark world of misery is to select some\nASPECTS out of it, see them as DIFFERENT, and DEFINE the difference as joy. Yet\nto PERCEIVE a difference where none exists will surely fail to MAKE a difference.\nIllusions carry ONLY guilt and suffering, sickness and death, to their believers.\nThe FORM in which they are accepted is irrelevant. NO form of misery, in reason's\neyes, CAN be confused with joy.\n\nJoy is eternal. You can be sure indeed that any seeming happiness\nwhich does not last is really fear. Joy does NOT turn to sorrow, for the eternal\ncannot change. But sorrow CAN be turned to joy, for time gives way to the\neternal. Only the timeless must remain unchanged. But everything in time can\nCHANGE with time. Yet, if the change be real and not IMAGINED, illusions MUST\ngive way to truth, and not to other dreams which are but equally unreal. THIS is\nno difference. Reason will tell you that the ONLY way to escape from misery is to\nRECOGNIZE it, AND GO THE OTHER WAY.\n\nTruth is the same and misery the same, but they ARE different from\neach other. In EVERY way, in every INSTANCE, and WITHOUT EXCEPTION. To believe\nthat one exception can exist, is to confuse what IS the same with what is\ndifferent. ONE illusion, cherished and defended AGAINST the truth, makes ALL\ntruth meaningless and ALL illusions real. Such is the power of belief. It CANNOT\ncompromise. And faith in innocence IS faith in sin, if the belief excludes ONE\nliving thing, and holds it out, APART from its forgiveness. Both reason AND the\nego will tell you this. But what they MAKE of it, is NOT the same.\n\nThe ego will assure you now that it is IMPOSSIBLE for you to see NO\nguilt in anyone. And, if THIS vision is the ONLY means by which ESCAPE from guilt\ncan be attained, then the belief in sin must be eternal. Yet reason looks on this\nin another way. For reason sees the SOURCE of an idea as what will make it true\nor false. This MUST be so, if the idea is LIKE its source. Therefore, says\nreason, if escape from guilt was given to the Holy Spirit as His purpose, and by\nOne to Whom NOTHING He wills CAN BE impossible, the means for its attainment are\nMORE than possible. They must be THERE, and YOU must HAVE them.\n\nThis is a crucial period in this course. For here, the separation of\nyou and the ego MUST be made complete. For, if you HAVE the means to let the Holy\nSpirit's purpose be accomplished, they CAN be used. And, THROUGH their use, will\nyou gain faith in them. Yet, to the ego, they MUST be impossible, and no-one\nundertakes to do what holds NO hope of EVER being done. You KNOW what your\nCreator wills is possible. But what you MADE believes it is not so. Now MUST you\nchoose between yourself and this ILLUSION of yourself. NOT both, but ONE.\n\nThere is no point in trying to avoid this ONE decision. It MUST be\nmade. Faith and belief can fall to either side, but reason tells you that misery\nlies ONLY on one side, and joy upon the other. FORSAKE NOT NOW EACH OTHER. For you who ARE the same will NOT decide alone. OR DIFFERENTLY. Either you give\neach other life or death; either you are each other's Savior or his judge,\noffering him sanctuary or condemnation. This course will be believed ENTIRELY, or\nnot at all. For it is wholly true or wholly false, and CANNOT be but partially\nbelieved. And you will either ESCAPE from misery entirely, or not at all.\n\nReason will tell you that there IS no middle ground where you can\npause uncertainly, waiting to choose between the joy of Heaven and the misery of\nhell. UNTIL you choose Heaven, you ARE in hell and misery. There is no PART of\nHeaven you can take, and weave into illusions. Nor is there ONE illusion you can\nenter Heaven WITH. A Savior cannot BE a judge, nor mercy condemnation. And vision\nCANNOT damn, but ONLY bless. Whose function is to save, WILL save. HOW He will do\nit IS beyond your understanding, but WHEN must be your choice. For time YOU made,\nand time you CAN command. You are no more a slave to time than to the world you\nmade.\n\nLet us look closer at the whole illusion that what you made has power\nto enslave its maker. This is the SAME belief that CAUSED the separation. It is\nthe meaningless idea that thoughts can LEAVE the thinker's mind, be DIFFERENT\nfrom it, AND IN OPPOSITION to it. If this were true, thoughts would not be the\nmind's extensions, but its ENEMIES. And here we see again another form of the\nsame fundamental illusion we have seen many times before. ONLY if it were\npossible the Son of God could LEAVE his Father's Mind, make himself DIFFERENT,\nand OPPOSE His Will, would it be possible that the self he made, and all IT made,\nshould be his master.\n\nBehold the great projection, but look on it with the decision that it\nMUST BE HEALED, and NOT with fear. NOTHING you made has ANY power over you,\nunless you still would be APART from your Creator, and with a will OPPOSED to\nHis. For ONLY if you would believe His Son COULD be His enemy, does it\nSEEM POSSIBLE that what YOU made is YOURS. YOU would condemn His joy to misery,\nand make HIM different. And all the misery you made has been your own. Are you\nnot GLAD to learn it is not true? Is it not welcome news to hear NOT ONE of the\nillusions that you made REPLACED the truth?\n\nOnly YOUR thoughts have been impossible. Salvation CANNOT be. It IS\nimpossible to look upon your Savior as your enemy, and RECOGNIZE him. Yet it IS\npossible to recognize him for what he IS, if God would have it so. What God has\ngiven to your holy relationship IS THERE. For what He gave the Holy Spirit to\ngive to you, He GAVE. Would you not look upon the Savior Who has been given you?\nAnd would you not exchange, in gratitude and gladness, the function of an\nexecutioner YOU gave him, for the one he has in truth? Receive of him what God\nhas given him for you, NOT what YOU tried to give.\n\nBeyond the bodies that you interposed between you, and shining in the\ngolden light that reaches it from the bright endless circle that extends forever,\nis your holy relationship, beloved of God, and holy as Himself. How still it\nrests, in time and yet beyond, immortal yet on earth. How great the power that\nlies in it. Time waits upon its will, and earth will BE as it would HAVE it be.\nHere is no SEPARATE will, nor the desire that ANYTHING be separate. Its will HAS\nno exceptions, and what it wills is true. Every illusion brought to its\nforgiveness is gently OVERLOOKED, and disappears. For, at its center, Christ has\nbeen reborn, to light His home with vision that overlooks the world.\n\nWould you not have this holy home be yours as well? No misery is here\nbut ONLY joy. All you need do to dwell in quiet here with Christ is SHARE His\nvision. Quickly and gladly is His vision given to anyone who is but WILLING to\nsee his brother sinless. And no-one CAN remain beyond this willingness, if YOU\nwould be released entirely from ALL effects of sin. Would you have PARTIAL\nforgiveness for yourself? Can YOU reach Heaven while a single sin still tempts\nyou to remain in misery? Heaven is the home of perfect purity. And God created it\nfor YOU. Look at your holy brother, sinless as yourself, and let him LEAD you\nthere.",

    "content": "Reason and the Holy Relationship\n\nThe introduction of reason into the ego's thought system is the\nbeginning of its undoing. For reason and the ego are CONTRADICTORY. Nor is it\npossible for them to co-exist in your AWARENESS. And reason's goal IS to make\nplain, and therefore obvious. You can SEE reason. This is not a play on words,\nfor here is the beginning of a vision that has meaning. Vision is sense, quite\nliterally. If it is not the body's sight, it MUST be understood. FOR IT IS PLAIN,\nand what is obvious is NOT ambiguous. It CAN be understood. And here do reason\nand the ego separate, to go their DIFFERENT ways.\n\nThe ego's whole continuance depends on its belief you cannot learn\nthis course. SHARE this belief, and reason will be unable to SEE your errors, and\nmake way for their correction. For reason SEES THROUGH errors, telling you what\nyou THOUGHT was real is not. Reason CAN see the difference between sin and\nmistakes, because it WANTS correction. Therefore it tells you what you thought\nwas uncorrectable, CAN be corrected. And therefore MUST have been an error. The\nego's OPPOSITION to correction leads to its fixed belief in sin, and DISREGARD of\nerrors. IT looks on NOTHING that can be corrected.\n\nThus does the ego damn, and reason save. Reason is not salvation in\nitself, but it MAKES WAY for peace, and brings you to a state of mind in which\nsalvation can be given you. Sin is a block, set like a heavy gate, locked and\nWITHOUT a key, across the road to peace. No-one who looks on it without the help\nof reason, would TRY to pass it. The body's eyes behold it as solid granite, so\nthick it would be madness to ATTEMPT to pass it. Yet reason sees through it\neasily BECAUSE it is an error. The FORM it takes cannot conceal its emptiness\nfrom REASON'S eyes.\n\nONLY the form of error attracts the ego. Meaning it does not\nRECOGNIZE, and does not know if it is there or not. Everything which the body's\neyes can see\nis a mistake, an error in perception, a distorted fragment of the whole, without\nthe meaning that the whole would give. And yet mistakes, regardless of their\nform, can be corrected. Sin is but error in a special form the ego venerates. It\nwould preserve ALL errors, and make them sins. For here is its OWN stability, its\nheavy anchor in the shifting world it made; the rock on which its church is\nbuilt, and where its worshippers are bound to bodies, and believe the body's\nfreedom is their own.\n\nReason will tell you that the FORM of error is not what makes it a\nmistake. If what the form CONCEALS is a mistake, the FORM can not prevent\ncorrection. The body's eyes see ONLY form. They cannot see BEYOND what they were\nMADE to see. And they were made to look on error, and NOT see past it. Theirs is\nindeed a strange perception, for they can see ONLY illusions, unable to look\nbeyond the granite block of sin, and stopping at the outside FORM of nothing. To\nthis distorted form of vision, the OUTSIDE of everything, the wall that stands\nbetween you and the truth, is wholly true.\n\nYet how can sight which stops at nothingness, as if it WERE a solid\nwall, see truly? It is HELD BACK by form, having been made to guarantee that\nnothing else BUT form will be perceived. These eyes, made NOT to see, will NEVER\nsee. For the idea they represent left not its maker, and it is their maker that\nsees through them. What was its maker's GOAL, but not to see? For THIS the body's\neyes are perfect means. But NOT for seeing. See how the body's eyes rest on\nexternals, and CANNOT go beyond. Watch how they STOP at nothingness, unable to go\nBEYOND the form to meaning.\n\nNothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form MEANS\nunderstanding HAS BEEN obscured. Only MISTAKES have different forms, and so they\nCAN deceive. You CAN change form, BECAUSE it is not true. It COULD not be\nreality, BECAUSE it can be changed. Reason will tell you that, if form is NOT\nreality, it MUST be an illusion. And is Not THERE to see. And, IF you see it, you MUST be mistaken, for you are seeing what can NOT be\nreal, as if it were. What cannot see BEYOND what is not there, MUST be distorted\nperception. And must perceive illusions AS THE TRUTH. Could it, then, RECOGNIZE\nthe truth?\n\nLet not the FORM of his mistakes keep you from him whose holiness is\nYOURS. Let not the vision of his holiness, the sight of which would show you YOUR\nforgiveness, be kept from you by what the body's eyes CAN see. Let your awareness\nof your brother NOT be blocked by your perception of his sins, and of his body.\nWhat is there in him that you would attack, EXCEPT what you associate with his\nbody, which YOU believe can sin? BEYOND his errors is his holiness, and YOUR\nsalvation. You gave him not his holiness, but tried to see your sins in him, to\nsave yourself. And yet his holiness IS your forgiveness. Can YOU be saved by\nmaking sinful the one whose holiness IS your salvation?\n\nA holy relationship, however newly born, must value holiness above all\nelse. Unholy values will produce confusion, and IN AWARENESS. In an unholy\nrelationship, each one is valued BECAUSE he seems to justify the other's sin. He\nsees within the OTHER what impels him to SIN AGAINST HIS WILL. And thus he lays\nhis sins upon the other, and is ATTRACTED to him to PERPETUATE his sins. And so\nit MUST become impossible for each to see HIMSELF as causing sin, by his DESIRE\nto have sin real. Yet reason sees a holy relationship as what it IS; a common\nstate of mind, where both give errors gladly to correction, that both may happily\nbe healed as one.",

You MUST go one way or the other. For now, if you go straight\nahead, the way you were going before you came to the branch, YOU WILL GO NOWHERE.\nThe whole purpose of coming this far is to decide WHICH BRANCH YOU WILL TAKE FROM\nHERE ON. The way you came no longer matters. IT CAN NO LONGER SERVE.\n\nNo-one who reaches this far CAN make the wrong decision. But he CAN\ndelay. And there is no part of the journey that seems more hopeless and futile\nthan standing where the road branches, and not deciding which way to go. It is\nonly the first few steps along the right way that seem hard, because you HAVE\nchosen, but you still think you can go back and make the other choice.\n\nThis is not so. A choice made with the power of Heaven to uphold it\ncannot BE undone. Your way IS decided.\n\nThere will be nothing you will NOT be told, if you acknowledge this.\n\nAnd so you stand, here in this holy place, before the veil of sin that\nhangs between you and the face of Christ. LET it be lifted! Raise it together,\nfor it is but a veil that stands between you. Either alone will see it as a solid\nblock, nor realize how thin the drapery that separates you now. Yes, it IS\nalmost over, IN YOUR AWARENESS. And peace has reached you even here, BEFORE the\nveil. Think what will happen after! The love of Christ will light YOUR faces, and\nshine from them into a darkened world that NEEDS the light. And, from this holy\nplace, He will return with you, not leaving it or you.\n\nYOU will become His messengers, returning Him unto Himself. Think of\nthe loveliness that YOU will see, who walk with Him! And think how beautiful will\neach of you look to the other! How happy you will be to be TOGETHER, after such a\nlong and lonely journey where you walked alone. The gates of Heaven, open now for\nyou, will you now open to the sorrowful. And none who looks upon the Christ in\nyou but will rejoice. How beautiful the sight you saw beyond the veil, which you\nwill bring to light the tired eyes of those as weary now as once you were. How\nthankful will they be to see you come among them, offering Christ's forgiveness\nto dispel their faith in sin.\n\nEvery mistake you make the other will gently have corrected FOR you.\nFor, in his sight, your loveliness is HIS salvation, which he would PROTECT from\nharm. And each will be the other's strong protector from EVERYTHING that seems to\nrise between you. So shall you walk the world with me, whose message has not yet\nbeen given everyone. For you are here to let it be RECEIVED. God's offer still is\nopen; yet it waits acceptance. From you who have accepted it, is it received.\nInto your joined hands is it safely given. For you who SHARE it have become its\nwilling guardians and protectors.\n\nTo all who share the love of God the grace is given to be the givers\nof what they have received. And so they learn that it is theirs forever. All\nbarriers disappear before their coming, as every obstacle was finally surmounted\nthat seemed to rise and block THEIR way before. This veil you lift together opens\nthe way to truth to more than you. Those who would let illusions be lifted from\ntheir minds are this world's Saviors, walking the world with their Redeemer, and\ncarrying His message of hope and freedom and RELEASE from suffering to everyone\nwho NEEDS a miracle to save him.\n\nHow EASY is it to offer this miracle to everyone! No-one who has\nreceived it for himself COULD find it difficult. For, BY receiving it, he learned\nit was not given him alone. Such is the function of a holy relationship; to\nRECEIVE together, and give as you received. Standing BEFORE the veil, it still\nseems difficult. But hold out your JOINED hands and touch this heavy-seeming\nblock, and you will learn how easily your fingers slip through its nothingness.\nIt is no solid wall.

    "content": "Weakness and Defensiveness\n\nHow does one overcome illusions? Surely not by force or anger. Nor by\nOPPOSING them in ANY way. Merely by letting reason tell you that they CONTRADICT\nreality. They GO AGAINST what must be true. The opposition comes from THEM, and\nNOT reality. Reality opposes nothing. What merely is, NEEDS no defense, and\noffers none. Only illusions need defense, BECAUSE OF WEAKNESS. And how CAN it be\ndifficult to walk the way of truth, when only WEAKNESS interferes? YOU are the\nstrong ones in this seeming conflict. And you need NO defense. Everything that\nneeds defense YOU DO NOT WANT. For anything that needs defense will WEAKEN you.\n\nConsider what the ego wants defenses FOR. ALWAYS to justify what GOES\nAGAINST the truth, flies in the face of reason, AND MAKES NO SENSE. Can this BE\njustified? What can this be, except an invitation to insanity, to save you FROM\nthe truth? And what would you be SAVED from, but what you FEAR? Belief in sin\nneeds GREAT defense, and at ENORMOUS cost. All that the Holy Spirit offers must\nbe DEFENDED AGAINST, and SACRIFICED. For sin is carved into a block out of YOUR\npeace, and laid BETWEEN you and its return. Yet how can peace BE so fragmented?\nIt is STILL whole, and NOTHING has been TAKEN FROM it.\n\nSee how the means and the material of evil dreams are nothing! In\ntruth, you stand together, with NOTHING in between. God holds your hands, and\nwhat can separate whom He has joined as one with Him? It is your Father Whom you\nwould defend against. Yet it remains impossible to keep Love out. God rests with\nyou in quiet, undefended and wholly undefending. For in this quiet state alone is\nstrength and power. Here can NO weakness enter, for here is no attack, and\ntherefore no illusions. Love rests in CERTAINTY. Only UNcertainty can BE\ndefensive. And ALL uncertainty is doubt about YOURSELF.\n\nHow weak is fear; how little and how meaningless! How insignificant\nbefore the quiet strength of those whom Love has joined! This is your “enemy;” a\nfrightened mouse which would attack the universe. How likely is it that it will\nSUCCEED? Can it be difficult to disregard its feeble squeaks that tell of its\nomnipotence, and would drown out the hymn of praise to its Creator that every\nheart throughout the universe forever sings as one? Which IS the stronger? Is it\nthis tiny mouse, or everything that God created? You are NOT joined together by\nthis mouse, but by the Will of God. And can a mouse BETRAY whom God has joined?\n\nIf you but RECOGNIZED how little stands between you and your AWARENESS\nof your union! Be not deceived by the illusions it presents of size and\nthickness, weight, solidity, and firmness of foundation. Yes, to the body's eyes\nit looks like an enormous, solid body, immovable as is a mountain. Yet, within\nYOU, there is a force which NO illusions can resist. This body only SEEMS to be\nimmovable. This force IS irresistible in truth. What, then, MUST happen when they\ncome together? Can the illusion of immovability be long defended for what is\nquietly PAST THROUGH, and GONE BEYOND?\n\nForget not, when you feel the need arise to be defensive about\nANYTHING, you have identified YOUR SELF with an illusion. And therefore feel that\nyou are weak, BECAUSE YOU ARE ALONE. This is the cost of ALL illusions. Not one\nbut rests on the belief that you are separate. Not one that does not SEEM to\nstand, heavy and solid and unmovable, between you and your brother. And not one\nthat truth can NOT pass over lightly, and so easily that you MUST be convinced,\nin spite of what you THOUGHT it was, that it was nothing. If you forgive each",

    "content": "Freedom and the Holy Spirit\n\nDo you want freedom of the body, or of the mind? For both you cannot\nhave. Which do you value? Which is your goal? For one you see as means; the\nother, end. And one must serve the other, and LEAD to its predominance,\nincreasing ITS importance by DIMINISHING its own. Means serve the end, and as the\nend is reached, the value of the means decreases, and is eclipsed entirely when\nthey are recognized as functionless. No-one but yearns for freedom, and tries to\nfind it, but he will seek for it where he believes it IS, and CAN be found. He\nwill believe it possible of mind OR body, and he will make the other SERVE his\nchoice, as means to find it.\n\nWhere freedom of the BODY has been chosen, the mind is used as MEANS,\nwhose value lies in its ability to contrive ways to achieve the body's freedom.\nYet freedom of the body HAS no meaning. And so the mind is DEDICATED to serve\nillusions. This is a situation SO contradictory and SO impossible that anyone who\nchooses this has NO idea of what is valuable. Yet even in this confusion, so\nprofound it cannot BE described, the Holy Spirit waits in gentle patience, as\ncertain of the outcome as He is sure of His Creator's love. He knows this mad\ndecision was made by one as dear to His Creator as Love is to Itself.\n\nBe not disturbed at all to think how He can change the role of means\nand end so easily in what God loves, and would have free forever. But be you,\nrather, grateful that YOU can be the means to serve His end. This is the ONLY\nservice which leads to freedom. To serve THIS end, the body MUST be perceived as\nsinless, BECAUSE the goal is sinlessness. The LACK of contradiction makes the\nsoft transition from means to end as easy as is the shift from hate to gratitude\nbefore forgiving eyes. You WILL be sanctified by one another, using your bodies\nONLY to serve the sinless. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE for you to hate what serves\nwhat you would HEAL.\n\nThis holy relationship, lovely in its innocence, mighty in strength,\nand blazing with a light far brighter than the sun which lights the sky YOU see,\nis chosen of your Father as a means for His Own plan. Be thankful that it serves\nyours not at all. Nothing entrusted to it can BE misused. And nothing given it\nbut WILL be used. This holy relationship has the power to heal ALL pain,\nREGARDLESS of its form. Neither of you alone can serve at all. Only in your JOINT\nwill does healing lie. For here YOUR healing is, and here will YOU accept\nAtonement. And in your healing IS the Sonship healed, BECAUSE your wills are\njoined.\n\nBefore a holy relationship, there IS no sin. The FORM of error is no\nlonger seen. And reason, joined with love, looks quietly on ALL confusion,\nobserving merely, “this was a mistake.” And then the same Atonement YOU accepted\nin YOUR relationship, CORRECTS the error, and lays a part of Heaven in its place.\nHow blessed are you, who let this gift be given! Each part of Heaven that you\nbring, is given YOU. And every empty place in Heaven that you fill again with the\nEternal Light YOU bring, shines now on YOU. The means of sinlessness can know no\nfear, because they carry ONLY love with them.\n\nChildren of peace, the light HAS come to you. The light you bring you\ndo NOT recognize, and yet you will remember. Who\ncan deny HIMSELF the vision that he brings to others? And who would fail to\nrecognize a gift he let be laid in Heaven through HIMSELF? The gentle service\nthat you give the Holy Spirit IS service to yourself. You who are now HIS means\nmust love all that He loves. And what you bring is YOUR remembrance of everything\nthat is eternal. No trace of anything in time can long remain in minds that serve\nthe timeless. And NO illusion can disturb the peace of a relationship which has\nbecome the MEANS of peace.\n\nWhen you have looked upon each other with COMPLETE forgiveness, from\nwhich NO error is excluded and NOTHING kept hidden, what mistake can there be\nANYWHERE you can NOT overlook? What form of suffering could BLOCK your sight,\npreventing you from seeing PAST it? And what illusion COULD there be you will NOT\nrecognize as a mistake; a shadow through which you walk COMPLETELY undismayed?\nGod would let NOTHING interfere with those whose wills are His. And they will\nRECOGNIZE their wills are His, BECAUSE they serve His Will. AND SERVE IT\nWILLINGLY. How can it NOT be theirs? And COULD remembrance of what they are be\nlong delayed?\n\nYou will see your value through each other's eyes, and each one is\nreleased as he beholds his Savior IN PLACE of the attacker who he THOUGHT was\nthere. Through this releasing is the world released. This is YOUR part in\nbringing peace. For you have asked what is your function here, and have been\nanswered. Seek not to change it, nor to substitute ANOTHER goal. This one was\nGIVEN you, and ONLY this. Accept this one, and serve it willingly, for what the\nHoly Spirit does with the gifts you give each other, to whom He offers them, and\nwhere and when, is up to Him.\n\nHe will bestow them where they are received and welcomed. He will use\nevery one of them for peace. Nor will one little smile, or willingness to\noverlook the tiniest mistake, be lost to anyone. What can it be but universal\nblessing to look on what your Father loves with charity? EXTENSION of forgiveness\nis the Holy Spirit's function. Leave this to Him. Let YOUR concern be only that\nyou give TO Him that which can BE extended. Save no dark secrets that He cannot\nuse. But offer Him the tiny gifts He can extend forever.\n\nHe will take every one, and make of it a potent force for peace. He\nwill withhold no blessing from it, or limit it in any way. He will join to it ALL\nthe power that God has given Him, to make each little gift of love a source of\nhealing for everyone. Each little gift you offer to the other lights up the\nworld. Be not concerned with darkness; look AWAY from it, and TOWARD each other.\nAnd let the darkness be dispelled by Him Who knows the light, and lays it gently\nin each gentle smile of faith and confidence with which you bless each other.\n\nOn your learning depends the welfare of the world. And it is only\narrogance that would DENY the power of your will. Think you the Will of God is\npowerLESS? Is this HUMILITY? You do not see what this belief has done. You see\nyourself as vulnerable, frail, and easily destroyed. And at the mercy of\ncountless attackers more powerful than you. Let us look straight at how this\nerror came about, for here lies buried the heavy anchor that seems to keep the\nfear of God in place, unmovable and solid as a rock. While this remains, so will\nit seem to be.\n\nWho can attack the Son of God, and NOT attack his Father? How can\nGod's Son be weak and frail and easily destroyed, UNLESS HIS FATHER IS? You do\nNOT see that EVERY sin and EVERY condemnation which you perceive and justify IS\nan attack upon your Father. And that is WHY it has not happened, nor COULD be\nreal. You do not see that this is your attempt, BECAUSE you think the Father and\nthe Son are separate. And you MUST think that they are separate, BECAUSE OF FEAR.\nFor it SEEMS safer to attack another or yourself, than to attack the great\nCreator of the universe, Whose power you KNOW.\n\nIf you were one with Him, AND RECOGNIZED THIS ONENESS, you would know\nHis power is YOURS. But you will NOT remember this, while you believe attack of\nANY kind means ANYTHING. It is unjustified in ANY form, BECAUSE it has no\nmeaning. The only way it COULD be justified is if each one of you were SEPARATE\nfrom the other, and all were separate from your Creator. For ONLY then would it\nbe possible to attack a part of the creation WITHOUT the whole; the Son WITHOUT\nthe Father. And to attack another, WITHOUT yourself; or hurt yourself, without\nthe other feeling pain.\n\nAnd this belief, you WANT. Yet wherein lies its value, EXCEPT in the\ndesire to attack in safety? Attack is neither safe nor dangerous. IT IS\nIMPOSSIBLE. And this is so, BECAUSE the universe is one. You would not\nchoose attack on its reality, if it were not ESSENTIAL to attack to see it\nSEPARATE FROM ITS CREATOR. And thus it seems as if love could attack, AND BECOME\nFEARFUL. Only the DIFFERENT can attack. So you conclude, BECAUSE you can attack,\nyou must be DIFFERENT. Yet does the Holy Spirit explain this differently. BECAUSE\nyou are NOT different, you CAN NOT ATTACK.\n\nEither position is a logical conclusion, if only the different can\nattack. Either could be maintained, BUT NEVER BOTH. The ONLY question to be\nanswered to decide which MUST be true, is WHETHER YOU ARE DIFFERENT. From the\nposition of what YOU understand, you seem to BE. And THEREFORE can attack. Of the\nalternatives, this SEEMS more natural, and more in line with your experience. And\ntherefore it is necessary that you have OTHER experiences, more in line with\ntruth, to teach you what IS natural and true. This is the function of your holy\nrelationship. For what ONE thinks, the OTHER will experience WITH him. What can\nthis mean, EXCEPT your minds are one?\n\nLook not with fear upon this happy fact, and think not that it lays a\nheavy burden on you. For, when you have ACCEPTED it with gladness, you will\nrealize that your relationship is a reflection of the union of the Creator and\nHis Son. From loving minds, there IS no separation. And every thought in one\nbrings gladness to the other, BECAUSE they are the same. Joy is unlimited,\nBECAUSE each shining thought of Love EXTENDS its Being, and creates more of\nItself. There is no difference ANYWHERE within it. For every thought is like\nItself.\n\nThe light that joins you shines throughout the universe. And, BECAUSE\nit joins you, so it makes you one with your Creator. And, in HIM, is all creation\njoined. Would you REGRET you cannot fear alone, when your relationship can also\nteach the power of love is there, which makes ALL fear impossible? Do not attempt\nto keep a little of the ego with this gift. For it was given to be USED, and NOT",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nDo you not see the OPPOSITE of frailty and weakness is sinlessness?\nINNOCENCE IS STRENGTH, and nothing else is strong. The sinless cannot fear. And\nfear of any kind is weakness. The show of strength attack would use to COVER\nfrailty, conceals it not. For how can the unreal BE hidden? No-one is strong who\nhas an enemy. And no-one can attack, unless he thinks he HAS. Belief in enemies\nis therefore the belief in WEAKNESS. And what is weak is NOT the Will of God.\nBeing OPPOSED to It, it is Its “enemy.” And God is feared, as an OPPOSING will.\n\nHow strange indeed becomes this war against Yourself! You will believe\nthat EVERYTHING you use for sin can hurt you, AND BECOME YOUR ENEMY. And you will\nfight AGAINST it, and try to weaken it, BECAUSE of this. And you will think that\nyou succeeded, and attack again. It is as certain you will fear what you attack,\nas it is sure that you will love what you perceive as sinless. He walks in peace\nwho travels sinlessly along the way Love shows him. For Love walks WITH him\nthere, PROTECTING him from fear. And he will see ONLY the sinless, who can NOT\nattack.\n\nWalk you in glory, with your head held high, and fear no evil. The\ninnocent are safe, because they SHARE their innocence. Nothing they see is\nharmful, for their AWARENESS of the truth releases everything from the illusion\nof harmfullness. And what SEEMED harmful now stands shining in their innocence,\nreleased from sin and fear, and happily returned to love. They share the strength\nof love BECAUSE they looked on innocence. And every error disappeared, because\nthey saw it not. Who looks for glory finds it where it IS. Where COULD it be, but\nin the innocent?\n\nLet not the little interferers pull you to littleness. There CAN be no\nattraction of guilt in innocence. Think what a happy world you walk, with truth\nbeside you! Do not give up this world of freedom, for a little sigh of seeming\nsin, nor for a tiny stirring of guilt's attraction. Would you, for all these\nmeaningless distractions, lay Heaven aside? Your destiny and purpose are far\nbeyond them, in the clean peace where littleness does not exist. Your purpose is\nat variance with littleness of any kind. And so it is at variance with sin.\n\nLet us not let littleness lead God's Son into temptation. His glory is\nBEYOND it, measureless and timeless as is Eternity. Do not let time intrude upon\nyour sight of him. Leave him not frightened and alone in his temptation. But help\nhim rise above it, and perceive the light of which he is a part. YOUR innocence\nwill light the way to his, and so is YOURS protected, and KEPT in your awareness.\nFor who can know his glory, and perceive the little and the weak about him? Who\ncan walk trembling in a fearful world, and realize that Heaven's glory shines in\nhim?\n\nNothing around you but is PART of you. Look on it lovingly, and see\nthe light of Heaven in it. So will you come to understand all that is given you.\nIn kind forgiveness will the world sparkle and shine, and everything you once\nthought sinful now will be re-interpreted as part of Heaven. How beautiful it is\nto walk, clean and redeemed and happy, through a world in bitter need of the\nredemption that your innocence bestows upon it! What can you value MORE than\nthis? For here is YOUR salvation and YOUR freedom. And it MUST be complete, if\nYOU would recognize it.",

    "content": "The Irreconcilable Beliefs\n\nThe memory of God comes to the quiet mind. It CANNOT come where there\nis conflict, for a mind at war against itself remembers not Eternal Gentleness.\nThe means of war are NOT the means of peace. And what the warlike would remember\nis NOT love. War is impossible unless belief in VICTORY is cherished. Conflict\nWITHIN you MUST imply that you believe the ego has the power TO BE VICTORIOUS.\nWhy else would you identify with it? Surely you realize the ego IS at war with\nGod. Certain it is it HAS no enemy. But just as certain is its fixed belief it\nhas an enemy that it MUST overcome, and WILL SUCCEED.\n\nDo you not realize a war against yourself would BE a war on God? Is\nvictory CONCEIVABLE? And, if it were, is this a victory that you would WANT? The\ndeath of God, if it were possible, would be YOUR death. Is this a VICTORY? The\nego ALWAYS marches to defeat, BECAUSE it thinks that triumph over you is\npossible. And God thinks otherwise. This is no war. Only the mad belief the Will\nof God can be attacked and overthrown. You may IDENTIFY with this belief, but\nnever will it be more than madness. And fear will reign in madness, and will SEEM\nto have replaced love there. This is the conflict's PURPOSE. And to those who\nthink that it is possible, the means seem real.\n\nBe certain that it is impossible God and the ego, or yourself and it,\nwill EVER meet. You SEEM to meet, and make your strange alliances, on grounds\nthat have no meaning. For your beliefs converge upon the body, the ego's chosen\nhome, which you believe is YOURS. You meet at a mistake;-- an error in your\nself-appraisal. The ego joins with an ILLUSION of yourself you SHARE with it. And\nyet, illusions cannot join. They ARE the same, and they are nothing. Their\njoining lies in nothingness;\ntwo are as meaningless as one, or as a thousand. The ego joins with nothing,\nBEING nothing. The victory it seeks is meaningless as is itself.\n\nBrothers, the war against yourself is almost over. The journey's end\nis at the place of peace. Would you not now ACCEPT the peace offered you here?\nThis enemy you fought as an INTRUDER on your peace is here transformed before\nyour sight into the GIVER of your peace. Your “enemy” was God Himself, to Whom\nall conflict, triumph, and attack of ANY kind are all unknown. He loves you\nperfectly, completely, and eternally. The Son of God at war with his Creator is a\ncondition as ridiculous as nature roaring at the wind in anger, and proclaiming\nthat it is part of itself no longer.\n\nCould nature possibly ESTABLISH this, and make it true? Nor IS it up\nto you to say what shall be part of you, and what is kept apart. The war against\nyourself was undertaken to teach the Son of God that he is NOT himself, and NOT\nhis Father's Son. For this, the memory of his Father MUST be forgotten. It IS\nforgotten in the body's life, and, if you think you ARE a body, you will believe\nyou HAVE forgotten it. But truth can never be forgotten by ITSELF. And you have\nNOT forgotten what you are. Only a strange illusion of yourself, a wish to\ntriumph OVER what you are, remembers not.\n\nThe war against yourself is but the battle of two illusions,\nstruggling to make them DIFFERENT from each other, in the belief the one which\nconquers will be true. There IS no conflict between them and the TRUTH. Nor ARE\nthey different from each other. Both are NOT true. And so it matters not what\nform they take. What made them is insane, and they remain part of what made them.\nMadness holds out no menace to reality, and has no influence upon it. Illusions\nCANNOT triumph over truth, nor can they\nthreaten it in any way. And the reality which they deny is NOT a part of them.\n\nWhat YOU remember IS a part of you. For you MUST be as God created\nyou. Truth does not fight against illusion, nor do illusions fight against the\ntruth. Illusions battle ONLY with themselves. Being fragmented, they fragment.\nBut truth is indivisible, and FAR beyond their little reach. You will remember\nwhat you know when you have learned you CANNOT be in conflict. One ILLUSION about\nyourself can battle with another, yet the war of two illusions is a state where\nNOTHING HAPPENS. There is no victor, and there is no victory. And truth stands\nradiant, APART from conflict, untouched and quiet, in the peace of God.\n\nConflict must be between two FORCES. It can NOT exist between one\npower and nothingness. There is nothing you COULD attack that is not part of you.\nAnd, BY attacking it, you make two illusions of yourself, IN CONFLICT with each\nother. And this occurs whenever you look on ANYTHING that God created with\nanything but love. Conflict is fearful, for it is the birth of fear. Yet what is\nborn of nothing cannot WIN reality through battle. Why would you fill your world\nwith conflicts with yourself? Let all this madness be undone for you, and turn in\npeace to the remembrance of God, still shining in your quiet mind.\n\nSee how the conflict of illusions disappears, when it is brought to\ntruth! For it seems real ONLY as long as it is seen as war between CONFLICTING\ntruths, the conqueror to be the truer, the MORE real, the VANQUISHER of the\nillusion that was less real, MADE an illusion by defeat. For conflict is the\nchoice BETWEEN illusions, one to be crowned as real, the other vanquished and\ndespised. Here will the Father NEVER be remembered. Yet NO illusion can invade\nHis home, and drive Him out of what He loves forever. And what He loves MUST be\nforever quiet and at peace, BECAUSE it\nis His home. And you who are beloved of Him are no illusions, being as true and\nholy as Himself.\n\nThe stillness of your certainty of Him and of yourself is home to both\nof you, who dwell as one, and NOT apart. Open the doors of His most holy home,\nand let forgiveness sweep away all trace of the belief in sin that keeps God\nhomeless, and His Son with Him. You are not strangers in the house of God.\nWelcome your brother to the home where God has set him in serenity and peace, and\ndwells with him. Illusions have no place where Love abides, protecting you from\nEVERYTHING that is not true. You dwell in peace as limitless as its Creator. And\nEVERYTHING is given those who would remember Him.\n\nOver His home the Holy Spirit watches, sure that its peace can never\nBE disturbed. How can the resting place of God turn on itself, and seek to\novercome the One Who dwells there? And think what happens when the house of God\nperceives itself divided. The altar disappears, the light grows dim, the temple\nof the Holy One becomes a house of sin. And nothing is remembered, EXCEPT\nillusions. Illusions CAN conflict, because their forms ARE different. And they do\nbattle ONLY to establish which FORM is true.\n\nIllusion meets illusion; truth, itself. The meeting of illusions leads\nto war. Peace looking on itself EXTENDS itself. War is the condition in which\nfear is born, and grows and seeks to dominate. Peace is the state where love\nabides, and seeks to share itself. Conflict and peace are opposites; where one\nabides, the other CANNOT be; where either goes, the other disappears. So is the\nmemory of God obscured in minds that have become illusion's battleground. Yet far\nbeyond this senseless war it shines, ready to BE remembered when you side with\npeace.",

    "content": "The Laws of Chaos\n\nThe “laws of chaos” CAN be brought to light, though NEVER understood.\nChaotic laws are hardly meaningful, and therefore out of reason's sphere. Yet\nthey APPEAR to constitute an obstacle to reason and to truth. Let us, then, look\nupon them calmly, that we may look BEYOND them, understanding what they ARE, NOT\nwhat they would maintain. It IS essential it be understood what they are FOR,\nbecause it is their PURPOSE to make meaningless, and to ATTACK the truth. Here\nare the laws that rule the world you made. And yet they govern nothing, and need\nNOT be broken; merely looked upon and gone beyond.\n\nThe first chaotic law is that the truth is different for everyone.\nLike all these principles, this one maintains that each is separate, and has a\ndifferent set of thoughts which SETS HIM OFF from others. This principle evolves\nfrom the belief there is a hierarchy of illusions; some are MORE valuable, and\nTHEREFORE true. And each establishes this FOR HIMSELF, and MAKES it true by his\nattack on what another values. This is justified BECAUSE the values differ. And\nthose who hold them SEEM to be unlike, and THEREFORE enemies.\n\nThink how this SEEMS to interfere with the first principle of\nmiracles. For this establishes degrees of TRUTH among illusions, making it appear\nthat some are HARDER to be overcome than others. If it were realized that they\nare all the same and EQUALLY untrue, it would be easy, then, to understand that\nmiracles apply to ALL of them. Errors of ANY kind can be corrected, BECAUSE they\nare untrue. When brought to truth, instead of TO EACH OTHER, they merely\ndisappear. No PART of nothing CAN be more resistant to the truth than can\nanother.\n\nThe second law of chaos, dear indeed to every worshipper of sin, is\nthat each one MUST sin, and therefore DESERVES attack and death. This principle,\nclosely related to the first, is the demand that errors call for punishment, and\nNOT correction. For the DESTRUCTION of the one who makes the error places him\nBEYOND correction, and beyond forgiveness. What he has done is thus interpreted\nas an irrevocable sentence on himself, which God Himself is powerless to\noverlook. Sin cannot BE remitted, being the belief the Son of God can make\nmistakes for which his own destruction becomes inevitable.\n\nThink what this SEEMS to do to the relationship between the Father and\nthe Son. Now it appears that they can NEVER be One again. For One must ALWAYS be\ncondemned, AND BY THE OTHER. Now are they different, and ENEMIES. And THEIR\nrelationship is one of opposition, just as the separate aspects of the Son meet\nONLY to conflict, but NOT to join. One becomes weak, the other strong BY HIS\nDEFEAT. And fear of God, and of each other, now appears as sensible, made real by\nwhat the Son of God has done, both to himself AND his Creator.\n\nThe arrogance on which the laws of chaos stand could not be more\napparent than emerges here. Here is a principle which would define what the\nCREATOR of reality must be; what He MUST think, and what He must believe; and how\nHe must RESPOND, believing it. It is not seen as even necessary that He be asked\nabout the truth of what has been established for His belief. His Son can TELL Him\nthis, and He has but the choice whether to take his word for it, or be mistaken.\n\nThis leads directly to the third preposterous belief that seems to\nmake chaos eternal. For, if God cannot BE mistaken, then He must accept His Son's\nbelief in what he is, and HATE him for it. See how the fear of God is REINFORCED\nby this third principle. Now it becomes IMPOSSIBLE to turn to Him for help in\nmisery. For now He has become the “enemy” Who “caused” it, and to Whom appeal is\nuseless. Nor can salvation lie within the Son,\nwhose every aspect seems to be at war with Him, and JUSTIFIED in its attack.\n\nAnd now is conflict made inevitable, and beyond the help of God. And\nnow salvation MUST remain impossible, because the Savior HAS become the enemy.\nThere can be NO release and NO escape. Atonement thus becomes a myth, and\nvengeance, NOT forgiveness, is the Will of God. From where all this begins, there\nIS no sight of help that can succeed. ONLY destruction can BE the outcome. And\nGod Himself SEEMS to be siding with it, to overcome His Son. Think not the ego\nwill enable you to find ESCAPE from what it wants. THAT is the function of this\ncourse, which does NOT value what the ego cherishes.\n\nThe ego values only what it TAKES. This leads to the fourth law of\nchaos which, if the others are accepted, MUST be true. This seeming law is the\nbelief you HAVE what you have taken. By this, another's loss becomes your gain,\nand thus it fails to recognize that you can never “take away” save from YOURSELF.\nYet all the other laws must lead to this. For enemies do NOT give willingly to\none another, nor would they seek to SHARE the things they value. And what your\nENEMIES would keep from you must BE worth having, just BECAUSE they keep it\nhidden from your sight.\n\nAll of the mechanisms of madness are seen emerging here. The “enemy,”\nmade strong by keeping hidden the valuable inheritance which should be yours;\nyour JUSTIFIED possession, and attack for what has been withheld; and the\ninevitable loss the enemy MUST suffer, to save YOURSELF. Thus do the guilty ones\nprotest their innocence. Were they not forced into this foul attack by the\nunscrupulous behavior of the enemy, they would respond with only kindness. But,\nin a savage world, the kind cannot survive. So they MUST take, or else be taken\nFROM.\n\nAnd now there is a vague, unanswered question, not yet “explained.”\nWhat IS this precious thing, this priceless pearl, this hidden secret treasure,\nto be wrested in righteous wrath from this most treacherous and cunning enemy? It\nmust be what you want, and never found. And now you “understand” the reason WHY\nyou found it not. For it was TAKEN from you by the enemy, and hidden where you\nwould not think to look. He hid it in his BODY, making it the cover for his\nguilt; the hiding place for what belongs to YOU.\n\nNow must his body be destroyed and sacrificed, that you may have that\nwhich BELONGS to you. His treachery DEMANDS his death, that YOU may live. And you\nattack only in self defense. But what is it you want, that NEEDS his death? Can\nyou be sure your murderous attack IS justified, unless you know what it is FOR?\nAnd here a final principle of chaos comes to the “rescue.” It holds there is a\nSUBSTITUTE for love. This is the “magic” that will cure all of your pain; the\nmissing factor in your madness THAT MAKES IT SANE. THIS is the reason why you\nmust attack. HERE is what makes your vengeance justified.\n\nBehold, unveiled, the ego's secret gift, torn from your brother's\nbody; hidden there in malice and in hatred for the one to whom the gift belongs.\nHE would deprive you of the secret ingredient which would give meaning to your\nlife. The substitute for love, born of your enmity to one another, MUST be\nsalvation. IT has no substitute, and there IS only one. And ALL relationships\nhave but the purpose of seizing it, and making it your own. Never is your\npossession made complete. And never will your brother cease his own attack on\nYOU, for what you stole. Nor will God end His vengeance upon both, for, in His\nmadness, HE must have this substitute for love, and kill you both.\n\nYou who believe you walk in sanity, with feet on solid ground, and\nthrough a world where meaning CAN be found, consider this: These ARE the laws on\nwhich your “sanity” appears to rest. These ARE the principles which makes the\nground beneath your feet seem solid. And it IS here you look for meaning. These\nare the laws YOU made for your salvation. They hold in place the substitute for\nHeaven that you prefer. This is their PURPOSE; they were MADE for this. There is\nno point in asking what they\nmean. This is apparent. The MEANS of madness MUST be insane. Are you as certain\nthat you realize the GOAL is madness?\n\nNO-ONE wants madness, nor does anyone cling to his madness if he sees\nthat this is what it IS. What PROTECTS madness is the belief THAT IT IS TRUE. It\nis the FUNCTION of insanity to TAKE THE PLACE of truth. It must be seen AS truth,\nto be believed. And, if it IS the truth, then must its opposite, which was the\ntruth before, be madness now. Such a reversal, COMPLETELY turned around, with\nmadness sanity, illusions true, attack a kindness, hatred love, and murder\nbenediction, IS the goal the laws of chaos serve. These are the means by which\nthe laws of God APPEAR to be reversed. Here do the laws of sin APPEAR to hold\nlove captive, and let sin go free.\n\nThese do not SEEM to be the goals of chaos. For, by the great\nreversal, they appear to be the laws of ORDER. How could it NOT be so? Chaos is\nlawlessness, and HAS no laws. To be believed, its SEEMING laws must be perceived\nas REAL. Their goal of madness MUST be seen as sanity. And fear, with ashen lips\nand sightless eyes, blinded and terrible to look upon, is lifted to the throne of\nlove, its dying conqueror, its substitute, the savior from salvation. How lovely\ndo the laws of fear make death appear! Give thanks unto the hero on love's\nthrone, who saved the Son of God for fear and death!\n\nAnd yet, how can it be that laws like these can BE believed? There is\na strange device that makes this possible. Nor is it unfamiliar; we have seen how\nit APPEARS to function many times before. In truth, it does NOT function, yet in\ndreams, where ONLY shadows play the major roles, it seems most powerful. No law\nof chaos COULD compel belief, but for the emphasis on form, AND DISREGARD OF\nCONTENT. No-one who thinks that one of them is true SEES WHAT IT SAYS. Some FORMS\nit takes seem to have meaning, and that is all.\n\nHow can some FORMS of murder NOT mean death? Can an attack in ANY form\nbe love? What FORM of condemnation is a blessing? Who makes his Savior powerless,\nand FINDS salvation? Let not the FORM of the attack on him deceive you. You\nCANNOT seek to harm him, and be saved. Who can find SAFETY from attack by turning\non himself? How can it matter what the FORM this madness takes? It is a judgment\nthat defeats ITSELF, condemning what it says it wants to save. Be not deceived\nwhen madness takes a form you think is lovely. What is intent on your\ndestruction, is NOT your friend.\n\nYou would maintain, and think it true, that you do NOT believe such\nsenseless laws, nor act upon them. And, when you look at what they SAY, they\nCANNOT be believed. Brothers, you DO believe them. For how else could you\nPERCEIVE the form they take, with content such as this? Can ANY form of this be\ntenable? Yet you believe them FOR the forms they take, and DO NOT RECOGNIZE the\ncontent. IT never changes. Can you paint rosy lips upon a skeleton, dress it in\nloveliness, pet it and pamper it, AND MAKE IT LIVE? And can you be content with\nan illusion that YOU are living?\n\nThere IS no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life\nmust be. In ANY state apart from Heaven, life is illusion. At best, it SEEMS like\nlife; at worst, like death. Yet both are judgments on what is NOT life, equal in\ntheir inaccuracy and lack of meaning. Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what\nis NOT in Heaven is not ANYWHERE. Outside of Heaven, only the conflict of\nillusions stands; senseless, impossible, and beyond ALL reason, and yet perceived\nas an eternal BARRIER to Heaven. Illusions ARE but forms. Their content is NEVER\ntrue.\n\nThe laws of chaos govern ALL illusions. Their forms conflict, making\nit SEEM quite possible to value some above the others. Yet each one rests as\nsurely on the belief the laws of chaos ARE the laws of order, as do the others.\nEach one upholds these laws completely, offering a certain witness that these\nlaws are true. The seeming gentler FORM of the attack is no less certain in its\nwitnessing, OR ITS RESULTS. Certain it is illusions will bring fear, because of\nthe beliefs that they imply, NOT for their form. And lack of faith in love, in\nANY form, attests to chaos AS REALITY.\n\nFrom the belief in sin, the faith in chaos MUST follow. It is BECAUSE\nit follows that it seems to be a logical conclusion; a valid step in ordered\nthought. The steps to chaos DO follow neatly from their starting-point. Each is a\ndifferent form in the progression of truth's reversal, leading still deeper into\nterror, and AWAY from truth. Think not one step is smaller than another, nor that\nreturn from one is easier. The whole descent from Heaven lies in each one. And\nwhere your thinking starts, there must it end.\n\nBrothers, take not one step in the descent to hell. For, HAVING taken\none, you will NOT RECOGNIZE the rest for what they are. And they WILL follow.\nAttack in ANY form has placed your foot upon the twisted stairway that leads FROM\nHeaven. Yet, any instant, it is possible to have this all undone. How can you\nknow whether you chose the stairs to Heaven or the way to hell? Quite easily.\nWhat do you feel? Is peace in your awareness? Are you CERTAIN which way you go?\nAnd are you sure the goal of Heaven CAN be reached? If not, you walk alone. Ask,\nthen, your Friend to JOIN with you, and GIVE you certainty of where you go.",

    "content": "Salvation Without Compromise\n\nIs it not true you do NOT recognize some of the forms attack can take?\nIf it is true attack in ANY form will hurt you, and will do so just as much as in\nanother form which you DO recognize, then it MUST follow that you do not always\nRECOGNIZE the source of pain. ATTACK IN ANY FORM IS EQUALLY DESTRUCTIVE. Its\nPURPOSE does not change. Its sole intent is murder, and what FORM of murder\nserves to cover the massive guilt and frantic fear of punishment the murderer\nMUST feel? He may deny he IS a murderer, and justify his savagery with smiles as\nhe attacks.\n\nYet he will suffer, and will look on his intent in nightmares, where\nthe smiles are gone, and where the purpose rises to meet his horrified awareness,\nand to pursue him still. For no-one THINKS of murder, and escapes the guilt the\nthought entails. If the INTENT is death, what matter the form it takes? Is death\nin ANY form, however lovely and charitable it may SEEM to be, a blessing and a\nsign the Voice for God speaks through you to your brother? The wrapping does not\nmake the gift you give. An empty box, however beautiful and gently given, still\ncontains nothing, and neither the receiver NOR THE GIVER is long deceived.\nWITHHOLD forgiveness from your brother, and you ATTACK him. You GIVE him nothing,\nand receive of him but what you gave.\n\nSalvation is no compromise of any kind. To compromise is to accept but\nPART of what you want; to take a little, and GIVE UP the rest. Salvation gives up\nnothing. It is complete for everyone. Let the IDEA of compromise but enter, and\nthe awareness of salvation's PURPOSE is lost, because it is not recognized. It is\nDENIED where compromise has been accepted. For compromise is the belief SALVATION\nis impossible. It would maintain you can attack a little, love a little, AND KNOW\nTHE DIFFERENCE. Thus it would\nteach a little of the same can still be different, and yet the same remain\nintact, as one. Does this make sense? Can it BE understood?\n\nThis course is easy just BECAUSE it makes no compromise. Yet it SEEMS\ndifficult to those who still believe that compromise is possible. They do NOT see\nthat, if it is, SALVATION IS ATTACK. Yet it is certain the belief that salvation\nis impossible can NOT uphold a quiet, calm assurance it has come. Forgiveness\ncannot BE withheld a little. Nor is it possible to attack for this and love for\nthat, and UNDERSTAND forgiveness. Would you not WANT to recognize assault upon\nyour peace in ANY form, if only thus does it become impossible that YOU lose\nsight of it? It CAN be kept shining before your vision, forever clear and NEVER\nout of sight, if YOU defend it not.\n\nThose who believe that peace can BE defended, and that attack is\nJUSTIFIED on its behalf, can NOT perceive it lies within them. How COULD they\nknow? Could they ACCEPT forgiveness side by side with the belief that murder\ntakes some forms by which their peace is SAVED? Would they be WILLING to accept\nthe fact their savage purpose is directed against themselves? No-one unites with\nenemies, nor is at one with them in purpose. And no-one COMPROMISES with an enemy\nbut hates him still, for what he KEPT from him. Mistake not truce for peace, nor\ncompromise for the ESCAPE from conflict.\n\nTo be RELEASED from conflict means that IT IS OVER. The door is open;\nyou have LEFT the battleground. You have NOT lingered there in cowering hope,\nbecause the guns are stilled an instant and the fear that haunts the place of\ndeath is not apparent, that it will not return. There IS no safety in a\nbattleground. You can look down on it in safety from above, and NOT be touched.\nBut, from within it, you can find NO safety. Not one tree left standing still\nwill shelter you. Not one illusion of protection stands against the faith in\nmurder. Here stands the body, torn between\nthe natural desire to communicate, and the unnatural intent to murder and to die.\n",

    "content": "The Fear of Life\n\nThe fear of God is fear of life, and NOT of death. Yet He remains the\nonly place of safety. In Him is no attack, and no illusion in any form stalks\nHeaven. Heaven is WHOLLY true. No difference enters. And what is ALL the same\ncannot conflict. You are NOT asked to fight AGAINST your wish to murder. But you\nARE asked to realize the FORM it takes conceals the SAME intent. And it is THIS\nyou fear, and NOT the form.\n\nWhat is NOT love IS murder. What is not loving MUST be an attack.\nEVERY illusion is an assault on truth. And every one does violence to the IDEA of\nlove, because it SEEMS to be of equal truth. What can be EQUAL to the truth, yet\ndifferent? Murder and love are incompatible. Yet, if they BOTH are true, then\nmust they be the SAME, and indistinguishable from one another. So WILL they be,\nto those who see God's Son a body. For it is NOT the body that is like the Son's\nCreator. And what is lifeless cannot BE the Son of Life.\n\nHow can a body be extended to hold the universe? Can IT create, and BE\nwhat it creates? And can it offer its creation ALL that it is, and NEVER suffer\nloss? God does not share His function with a body. He GAVE the function to create\nunto His Son, BECAUSE it is His Own. It is NOT sinful to believe the function of\nthe Son is murder. But it IS insanity. What is the same can HAVE no different\nfunction. Creation is the means for God's extension. And what is His MUST be His\nSon's as well. Either the Father AND the Son are murderers, or neither is. Life\nmakes not death, creating like itself.\n\nThe lovely light of your relationship IS like the love of God. It\ncannot yet assume the holy function God gave His Son, for your forgiveness of one\nanother is not complete as yet. And so it cannot be extended to ALL creation.\nEach form of murder and attack that still attracts you, and that you do not\nrecognize for what it is, limits the healing and the miracles you HAVE the power\nto extend to all. Yet does the Holy Spirit understand how to increase your little\ngifts, and make them mighty. Also He understands how your relationship is raised\nABOVE the battleground, IN it no more.\n\nThis is your part; to realize that murder, in ANY form, is NOT your\nwill. The OVERLOOKING of the battleground is now your purpose. Be lifted up, and\nfrom a higher place, look down upon it. From there, will your perspective be\nquite different. Here, in the midst of it, it DOES seem real. Here you have\nCHOSEN to be part of it. Here murder IS your choice. Yet, from above, the choice\nis miracles, INSTEAD of murder. And the perspective COMING FROM this choice shows\nyou the battle is NOT real, and easily escaped. Bodies may battle, but the clash\nof forms is meaningless. And it IS over, when you realize it never was begun.\n\nHow can a battle be perceived as nothingness, when you ENGAGE in it?\nHow can the truth of miracles be RECOGNIZED, if murder is your choice? When the\ntemptation to attack rises to make your mind darkened and murderous, remember you\nCAN see the battle from above. Even in forms you do NOT recognize, the signs you\nknow. There is a stab of pain, a twinge of guilt, and, above all, a LOSS OF\nPEACE. This you know well. When it occurs, leave not your place on high, but\nquickly choose a miracle INSTEAD of murder. And God Himself and all the lights of\nHeaven, will gently lean to you, and hold you up. For you have chosen to remain\nwhere He would have you. And NO illusion can attack the peace of God TOGETHER\nwith His Son.\n\nSee no-one from the battleground, for there you look on him from\nnowhere. You have NO reference point from where to look, where meaning can be\ngiven what you see. For only bodies COULD attack and murder, and if this is your\npurpose, then you MUST be one with them. Only a PURPOSE unifies, and those who\nshare a purpose have a mind as one. The body HAS no purpose of itself, and MUST\nbe solitary. From below, it cannot BE surmounted. From above, the limits it\nexerts on those in battle still, are gone and NOT perceived. The body stands\nbetween the Father and the Heaven He created for His Son. BECAUSE it has no\npurpose.\n\nThink what is given those who share their Father's purpose, and who\nKNOW that it is theirs! They want for nothing. Sorrow of any kind is\ninconceivable. Only the Light they love is in awareness, and only Love shines\nupon them forever. It is their past, their present, and their future. Always the\nsame, eternally complete, and wholly shared. They KNOW it is impossible their\nhappiness could EVER suffer change of any kind. Perhaps you think the\nbattleground CAN offer something that you can win. CAN it be anything that offers\nyou a perfect calmness, and a sense of love so deep and quiet that no touch of\ndoubt can EVER mar your certainty? And that will last forever?\n\nThose with the strength of God in their awareness could never THINK of\nbattle. What COULD they gain but LOSS of their perfection? For everything fought\nfor on the battleground is of the body; something it seems to offer or to own.\nNo-one who knows that he has everything could seek for limitation, nor COULD he\nvalue the body's offerings.

    "content": "Specialness as a Substitute for Love\n\nLove IS extension. To withhold the smallest gift is not to know love's\npurpose. Love offers everything forever. Hold back but ONE belief, ONE offering,\nand love is gone, because you asked a substitute to take its place. And now must\nwar, the SUBSTITUTE for peace, come with the one alternative that you CAN choose\nfor love. Your CHOOSING it has given it ALL the reality it seems to have. Beliefs\nwill never OPENLY attack each other, because conflicting outcomes ARE impossible.\nBut an UNRECOGNIZED\nbelief is a decision to war in secret, where the results of conflict are kept\nunknown and NEVER brought to reason, to be considered sensible or not.\n\nAnd many senseless outcomes HAVE been reached, and meaningless\ndecisions have been made and kept hidden, to become beliefs now GIVEN power to\ndirect all subsequent decisions. Mistake you not the power of these hidden\nwarriors to disrupt your peace. For it IS at their mercy while you decide to\nleave it there. The secret enemies of peace, your least decisions to choose\nattack instead of love, unrecognized and swift to challenge YOU to combat and to\nviolence far more inclusive than you think, are there by your election. Do not\ndeny their presence, nor their terrible results. All that can BE denied is their\nREALITY, but NOT their outcome.\n\nAll that is ever cherished as a hidden belief, to be defended though\nunrecognized, is FAITH IN SPECIALNESS. This takes many forms, but ALWAYS clashes\nwith the reality of God's creation, and with the grandeur which He gave His Son.\nWhat else COULD justify attack? For who could hate someone whose Self is his, and\nwhich He KNOWS? Only the special COULD have enemies, for they are different, and\nNOT the same. And difference of ANY kind imposes orders of reality, and a need to\njudge that cannot BE escaped. What God created cannot be attacked, for there is\nnothing in the universe unlike itself.\n\nBut what is different CALLS for judgment, and this MUST come from\nsomeone “better,” someone incapable of being like what he condemns, “above” it,\nsinless BY COMPARISON with it. And thus does specialness become a means and end\nat once. For specialness not only sets apart, but serves as grounds from which\nattack on those who seem “beneath” the special one is “natural” and “just.” The\nspecial ones feel weak and frail BECAUSE of differences. For what would make them\nspecial IS their enemy. Yet they PROTECT its enmity, and call it “friend.” On its\nbehalf they fight against the universe,\nfor nothing in the world they value more.\n\n Specialness is the great dictator of the wrong decisions.\nHere is the grand illusion of what you are and what your brother is. And here is\nwhat MUST make the body dear, and WORTH preserving. SPECIALNESS MUST BE DEFENDED.\nIllusions CAN attack it, and they DO. For what your brother MUST become, to KEEP\nyour specialness, IS an illusion. He who is “worse” than you MUST be attacked, so\nthat your specialness can live on his defeat. For specialness is triumph, and its\nvictory IS his defeat and shame. How can he live, with all your sins upon him?\nAnd who MUST be his conqueror but you?\n\nWould it be POSSIBLE for you to hate your brother if you were like\nhim? COULD you attack him if you realized you journey WITH him, to a goal that is\nthe SAME? Would you not help him reach it, in every way you could, if his\nattainment of it were yours? You ARE his enemy in specialness; his Friend in a\nSHARED purpose. Specialness can NEVER share, for it depends on goals that you\nALONE can reach. And he must NEVER reach them, or YOUR goal is jeopardized. Can\nlove HAVE meaning where the goal is triumph? And what decision CAN be made for\nthis, that will NOT hurt you?\n\nYour brother is your Friend BECAUSE his Father created him like you.\nThere IS no difference. You have been GIVEN to each other that love might be\nextended, NOT cut off from one another. What you KEEP is lost to you. God gave\nyou both Himself. And to remember this is now the ONLY purpose that you share.\nAnd so it is the only one you HAVE. Could you attack each other if you chose to\nsee NO specialness of any kind between you? Look fairly at whatever makes you\ngive each other partial welcome, or would let you think that you are better off\napart. Is it not ALWAYS your belief your specialness is LIMITED by your\nrelationship? And is not THIS the “enemy” that makes you both illusions to each\nother?\n\nThe fear of God and of each other comes from each unrecognized belief\nin specialness. For each demands the other bow to it AGAINST HIS WILL. And God\nHimself must honor it, or suffer vengeance. Every twinge of malice, or stab of\nhate, or wish to separate arises here. For here the purpose that you share\nbecomes obscured from BOTH of you. You would oppose this course because it\nteaches you, YOU ARE ALIKE. You have NO purpose that is not the same. And none\nyour Father does not share with you. For your relationship has been made clean of\nspecial goals. And would you now DEFEAT the goal of holiness that Heaven gave it?\n\nWhat perspective can the special have that does NOT change with every\nseeming blow, each slight, or fancied judgment on itself? Those who are special\nMUST defend illusions against the truth. For what is specialness but an attack\nupon the Will of God? You love your brother not while it is this you would defend\nAGAINST him.

    "content": "The Treachery of Specialness\n\nComparison MUST be an ego device, for love makes none. Specialness\nALWAYS makes comparisons. It is ESTABLISHED by a lack seen in another, and\nmaintained by searching for and keeping clear in sight all lacks it can perceive.\nThis does it seek, and this it looks upon. And ALWAYS whom it thus diminishes\nwould be your Savior, had you not chosen to make of him a tiny measure of your\nspecialness instead. Against the littleness you see in him you stand as tall and\nstately, clean and honest, pure and unsullied by comparison with what you see.\n\nNor do you understand it is YOURSELF that you diminish thus. Pursuit\nof specialness is always at the cost of peace. Who can attack his Savior, and cut\nhim down, and recognize his strong support? Who can detract from his omnipotence,\nand SHARE his power? And who can use him as the gauge of littleness, and be\nRELEASED from limits? You have a function in salvation. ITS pursuit will bring\nyou joy. But the pursuit of specialness MUST bring you pain. Here is a goal that\nwould defeat salvation, and thus run COUNTER to the Will of God. To value\nspecialness is to esteem an alien will, to which illusions of yourself ARE dearer\nthan the truth.\n\nSpecialness is the idea of sin MADE REAL. Sin is impossible even to\nimagine, without this base. For sin rose from it, out of nothingness, an evil\nflower with no roots at all. Here is the self-made savior, the creator who\ncreates UNLIKE the Father, and which made His Son like to itself, and NOT like\nunto Him. His SPECIAL sons are many, NEVER one, each one in exile from himself\nand Him of Whom they are a part. Nor do they love the Oneness which created them\nas One with Him. They chose their specialness INSTEAD of Heaven and INSTEAD of\npeace, and wrapped it carefully in sin, to keep it “safe” from truth.\n\nYou are NOT special. If you think you are, and would defend your\nspecialness against the truth of what you REALLY are, how can you know the truth?\nWhat answer that the Holy Spirit gives can reach you, when it is your specialness\nto which you listen, and which asks AND ANSWERS? Its tiny answer, soundless in\nthe melody which pours from God to you eternally in loving praise of what you\nare, is all you listen to. And that vast song of honor and of love for what you\nare seems silent and unheard before ITS mightiness. You strain your ears to hear\nITS soundless voice, and yet the Call of God Himself is soundless to you.\n\nYou CAN defend your specialness, but never will you hear the Voice for\nGod beside it. They speak a different language, and they fall on different ears.\nTo every special one a DIFFERENT message, and one with DIFFERENT meaning, is the\ntruth. Yet how CAN truth be different to each one? The special messages the\nspecial hear convince them THEY are different and apart; each in his special sins\nand safe from love, which does not see his specialness at all. Christ's Vision IS\ntheir enemy, for it sees not what THEY would look upon. And it WOULD show them\nthat the specialness they think they see IS an illusion.\n\nWhat would they see instead? The shining radiance of the Son of God,\nso like his Father that the memory of Him springs instantly to mind. And with\nthis memory, the Son remembers his own creations, as like to him as he is to his\nFather. And all the world he made, and all his specialness, and all the sins he\nheld in its defense AGAINST himself, will vanish as his mind accepts the truth\nabout himself, as it returns to take their place. This is the only “cost” of\ntruth. You will no longer see what never was, nor hear what makes no sound. Is it\na sacrifice to give up nothing, and to receive the Love of God forever?\n\nYou who have chained your Savior to your specialness, and given it HIS\nplace, remember this: He has NOT lost the power to forgive you all the sins you\nthink you placed between him and the function of salvation GIVEN\nhim for you. Nor will you CHANGE his function, any more than you can change the\ntruth in him and in yourself. But be you certain that the truth is just the same\nin both. It gives no different messages, and has ONE meaning. And it is one you\nBOTH can understand, and one which brings release to BOTH of you. Here stands\nyour brother with the key to Heaven in his hand, held out to you. Let not the\ndream of specialness remain between you. What is one IS joined in truth.\n\nThink of the loveliness that you will see within yourself, when you\nhave looked on him as on a Friend. He IS the enemy of specialness, but ONLY\nfriend to what is real in you. Not one attack you thought you made on him has\ntaken from him the gift that God would have him give to you. His need to give it\nis as great as yours to have it. Let him forgive you all your specialness, and\nmake you whole in mind, and one with him. He waits for your forgiveness only that\nhe may return it unto you. It is not God Who has condemned His Son. But ONLY you,\nto save his specialness, and kill his Self.\n\nYou have come far along the way of truth; too far to falter now. Just\none step more, and every vestige of the fear of God will melt away in love. Your\nbrother's specialness and yours ARE enemies, and bound in hate to kill each other\nand DENY they are the same. Yet it is not illusions that have reached this final\nobstacle that seems to make God and His Heaven so remote that they cannot be\nreached. Here, in this holy place, does truth stand waiting to receive you both\nin silent blessing, and in peace so real and so encompassing that NOTHING stands\noutside.\n\nLeave all illusions of yourself OUTSIDE this place, to which you come\nin hope and honesty. Here is your Savior FROM your specialness. He is in need of\nyour acceptance of himself as part of you, as you for his. You are alike to God\nas God is to Himself. He is not special, for He would not keep one part of what\nHe is unto Himself, NOT given to His Son, but kept\nfor Him alone. And it is this you fear; for, if He is not special, then He willed\nHis Son be like Him, and your brother IS like you. Not special, but possessed of\neverything, INCLUDING you.\n\nGive him but what he has, remembering God gave Himself to BOTH of you\nin equal love, that both might share the universe with Him Who chose that love\ncould never be divided and kept separate from what it IS and must forever be. You\nARE your brother's; part of love was not DENIED to him. But can it be that YOU\nhave lost because HE is complete? What has been given him makes YOU complete, as\nit does him. God's love gave you to him and him to you, BECAUSE He gave Himself.\nWhat is the same as God IS One with Him. And ONLY specialness could make the\ntruth of God and you AS One seem anything BUT Heaven. And the hope of peace at\nlast in sight.\n\nSpecialness is the seal of treachery upon the gift of love. Whatever\nserves its purpose MUST be given to kill. No gift that bears its seal but offers\ntreachery to giver and receiver. Not one glance from eyes it veils but looks on\nsight of death. Not one believer in its potency but seeks for bargains and for\ncompromise that would establish sin as love's substitute, and serve it\nfaithfully. And no relationship that holds its purpose dear but clings to murder\nas safety's weapon, and the great defender of all illusions from the “threat” of\nlove.\n\nThe hope of specialness makes it seem possible God made the body as\nthe prison-house which keeps His Son from Him. For it DEMANDS a special place God\ncannot enter, and a hiding-place where none is welcome but your tiny self.\nNothing is sacred here but unto you, and you alone, apart and separate from all\nyour brothers; safe from ALL intrusions of sanity upon illusions; safe from God,\nand safe for conflict everlasting.\nHere are the gates of hell you closed upon yourself, to rule in madness and in\nloneliness your special kingdom, APART from God, AWAY from truth and from\nsalvation.\n\nThe key you threw away God gave your brother, whose holy hands would\noffer it to you, when you were ready to accept His plan for your salvation in\nplace of yours. How could this readiness be reached save through the sight of all\nyour misery, and the awareness that your plan has failed, and will forever fail\nto bring you peace and joy of ANY kind? Through this despair you travel now, yet\nit is but ILLUSION of despair. The death of specialness is NOT your death, but\nyour awaking into Life Eternal. You but emerge from an illusion of what you are,\nto the acceptance of yourself as God created you.",

    "content": "The Forgiveness of Specialness\n\nForgiveness is the end of specialness. Only illusions can BE forgiven,\nand then they disappear. Forgiveness is release from ALL illusions, and that is\nwhy it is impossible but PARTLY to forgive. No-one who clings to ONE illusion can\nsee himself as sinless, for he holds one error to himself as lovely still. And so\nhe calls it “unforgivable,” and makes it sin. How can he then give HIS\nforgiveness wholly, when he would not receive it for himself? For it is sure he\nWOULD receive it wholly, the instant that he gave it so. And thus HIS secret\nguilt would disappear, forgiven by himself.\n\nWhatever form of specialness you cherish, you have made sin. Inviolate\nit stands, strongly defended with all your puny might against the Will of God.\nAnd thus it stands against YOURSELF, YOUR enemy, NOT God's. So does it seem to\nsplit you off from God, and make you separate from Him as its defender. YOU would\nprotect what God created not. And yet this idol that seems to GIVE you power has\ntaken it away. For you have given your brother's birthright to it, leaving HIM\nalone and unforgiven, and yourself in sin beside him, both in misery, before the\nidol that can save you not.\n\nIt is not YOU that is so vulnerable and open to attack that just a\nword, a little whisper that you do not like, a circumstance that suits you not,\nor an event that you did not anticipate upsets your world, and hurls it into\nchaos. Truth is not frail. Illusions leave it perfectly unmoved and undisturbed.\nBut specialness is NOT the truth in you. IT can be thrown off balance by\nANYTHING. What rests on nothing NEVER can be stable. However large and over-blown\nit SEEMS to be, it still must rock and turn and whirl about with every breeze.\n\nWithout foundation nothing is secure. Would God have left His Son in\nsuch a state, where safety HAS no meaning? No, -- His Son is safe, resting on\nHim. It is your specialness that is attacked by everything that walks and\nbreathes, or creeps or crawls, or even lives at all. Nothing\nis safe from its attack, and it is safe from nothing. It will forever more BE\nunforgiving, for that is what it IS. A secret vow that what God wants for you\nwill never be, and that you will oppose His Will forever. Nor is it possible the\ntwo can ever be the same, while specialness stands like a flaming sword of death\nbetween them, and makes them enemies.\n\nGod asks for your forgiveness. He would have no separation, like an\nalien will, rise between what He wills for you, and what YOU will. THEY are the\nsame, for neither one wills specialness. How could they will the death of love\nitself? Yet they are powerless to make attack upon illusions. They are NOT\nBODIES; as One Mind they wait for all illusions to be BROUGHT to them, and left\nbehind. Salvation challenges not even death. And God Himself, Who knows that\ndeath is NOT your will, must say, “Thy will be done,” because YOU think it is.\n\nForgive the great Creator of the universe, the Source of life, of love\nand holiness, the perfect Father of a perfect Son, for your illusions of your\nspecialness. Here is the hell you chose to be your home. He chose not this for\nyou. Ask not He enter this. The way is barred to love and to salvation. Yet if\nyou would release your brother from the depths of hell, you have forgiven Him\nWhose Will it is you rest forever in the arms of peace, in perfect safety, and\nwithout the heat and malice of one thought of specialness to mar your rest.\nForgive the Holy One the specialness He could not give, and yet you made instead.\n\nThe special ones are all asleep, surrounded by a world of loveliness\nthey do not see. Freedom and peace and joy stand there, beside the bier on which\nthey sleep, and call them to come forth and waken from their dream of death. Yet\nthey hear nothing. They are lost in dreams of specialness. They hate the call\nthat would awaken them. And they curse God because He did not make their dream\nreality. Curse God and die, but not by Him Who made not death, but only in the\ndreams. Open your eyes a little; see the Savior God gave to you that you might look on him, and give him back his\nbirthright. It is YOURS.\n\nThe slaves of specialness will yet be free. Such is the Will of God,\nand of His Son. Would God condemn HIMSELF to hell and to damnation? And do YOU\nwill that this be done unto your Savior? God calls to you from him to join His\nWill to save you BOTH from hell. Look on the print of nails upon his hands that\nhe holds out for your forgiveness. God asks your mercy on His Son, and on\nHimself. Deny them not. They ask of you but that your will be done. They seek\nyour love that you may love yourself. Love not your specialness instead of them.\nThe print of nails are on your hands as well. Forgive your Father it was NOT\nHis Will that you be crucified.",

    "content": "Specialness and Salvation\n\nSpecialness is a lack of trust in anyone except yourself. Faith is\ninvested in yourself alone. Everything else becomes your enemy, feared and\nattacked, deadly and dangerous, hated and worthy only of destruction. Whatever\ngentleness it offers is but deception, but its hate is real. In danger of\ndestruction, it MUST kill, and YOU are drawn to it, to kill it first. And such is\nguilt's attraction. Here is death enthroned as savior; crucifixion is now\nredemption, and salvation can ONLY mean destruction of the world, EXCEPT\nYOURSELF.\n\nWhat could the purpose of the body be BUT specialness? And it is this\nthat makes it frail and helpless in its own defense. It was CONCEIVED to make YOU\nfrail and helpless. The goal of separation is its curse. But bodies HAVE no goal.\nPurpose is of the mind. And minds can change, as they desire. What they ARE, and\nall their attributes, CANNOT change. But what they hold as purpose CAN be\nchanged, and body states must shift accordingly. Of itself, the body can do\nnothing. See it as means to hurt, and it is hurt. See it as means to heal, and it\nis healed.\n\nYOU CAN BUT HURT YOURSELF. This has been oft repeated, but is\ndifficult to grasp as yet. To minds intent on specialness, it is impossible. But\nto those who wish to heal and NOT attack, it is quite obvious. The purpose of\nattack is in the MIND, and its effects are felt but where it IS. Nor is mind\nlimited; so must it be that harmful purpose hurts the mind AS ONE. Nothing could\nmake LESS sense to specialness. Nothing could make MORE sense to miracles. For\nmiracles are merely change of purpose from hurt to healing.\n\nThis shift in purpose DOES “endanger” specialness, but only in the\nsense that all illusions are “threatened” by the truth. They will NOT stand\nbefore it, yet what comfort has ever been in them, that you would keep the\ngift your Father asks from Him, and give it there instead? Given to HIM, the\nuniverse is yours. Offered to THEM, no gifts can be returned. What you have given\nspecialness has left you bankrupt, and your treasure-house barren and empty, with\nan open door inviting everything that would disturb your peace to enter and\ndestroy.\n\nLong ago we said consider not the means by which salvation is\nattained, nor how to reach it. But DO consider, and consider well, whether it be\nyour WISH that you might see your brother sinless. To specialness the answer MUST\nbe “no.” A sinless brother IS its enemy, while sin, if it were possible, WOULD be\nits friend. Your brother's “sins” would justify itself, and GIVE it meaning that\nthe truth denies. All that is real proclaims his sinlessness. All that is false\nproclaims his sins as real. If HE is sinful, then is YOUR reality not real, but\njust a dream of specialness which lasts an instant, crumbling into dust.\n\nDo not defend this senseless dream, in which God is bereft of what He\nloves, and you remain beyond salvation. Only this is certain, in this shifting\nworld which has NO meaning in reality: When peace is not with you ENTIRELY, and\nwhen you suffer pain of ANY kind, you have beheld some sin within your brother,\nAND HAVE REJOICED at what you thought was there. Your specialness seemed safe",

    "content": "The Resolution of the Dream\n\nThe Christ in you is very still. He looks on what He loves, and knows\nit as Himself. And thus does He rejoice at what He sees, because He knows that it\nis one with Him, and with His Father. Specialness, too, takes joy in what it\nsees, although it is not true. Yet what you seek for IS a source of joy, as you\nconceive it. What you wish IS true for you. Nor is it possible that you can wish\nfor something, and LACK faith that it is so. WISHING MAKES REAL, as surely as\ndoes Will create. The power of a wish upholds illusions as strongly as does Love\nextend Itself. Except that one deludes; the other heals.\n\nThere is no dream of specialness, however hidden or disguised its\nform, however lovely it may seem to be, however much it delicately offers the\nhope of peace and the escape from pain, in which you suffer not your\ncondemnation. In dreams effect and cause are interchanged, for here the maker of\nthe dream believes that what he made is happening TO him. He does NOT realize he\npicked a thread from here, a scrap from there, and wove a picture out of nothing.\nFor the parts do NOT belong together, and the whole contributes nothing to the\nparts to GIVE them meaning.\n\nWhere could your peace arise BUT from forgiveness? The Christ in you\nlooks ONLY on the truth, and sees no condemnation that could NEED forgiveness. HE\nis at peace BECAUSE He sees no sin. Identify with Him, and what has He that you\nhave not? He is your eyes, your ears, your hands, your feet. How gentle are the\nsights He sees, the sounds He hears. How beautiful His hand that holds His\nbrother's, and how lovingly He walks beside him, showing him what CAN be seen and\nheard, and where he will see nothing, and there IS no sound to hear.\n\nYet let your specialness direct his way, and YOU will follow. And both\nwill walk in danger, each intent, in the dark forest of the sightless, unlit but\nby the shifting, tiny gleams that spark an instant from the fireflies of sin and\nthen go out, to lead the other to a nameless precipice and hurl him over it. For\nwhat can specialness delight in but to kill? What does it seek for but the sight\nof death? Where does it lead but to destruction? Yet think not that it looked\nupon your brother FIRST, nor hated him BEFORE it hated you. The sin its eyes\nbehold in him, and love to look upon it saw in you, and looks on still with joy.\n\nYet IS it joy to look upon decay and madness, and believe this\ncrumbling thing, with flesh already loosened from the bone and sightless holes\nfor eyes, is like yourself? Rejoice you HAVE no eyes with which to see; no ears\nto listen, and no hands to hold nor feet to guide. Be glad that ONLY Christ can\nlend you His, while you have need of them. They are illusions, too, as much as\nyours. And yet, because they serve a different purpose, the strength their\nPURPOSE holds is given THEM. And what THEY see and hear and hold and lead is\ngiven light, that YOU may lead as you were led.\n\nThe Christ in you is very still. He knows where you are going, and He\nleads you there in gentleness and blessing all the way. His love for God replaces\nALL the fear you thought you saw within yourself. His holiness shows you Himself\nin him whose hand you hold, and whom you lead to Him. And what you see IS like\nyourself. For what but Christ IS there to see and hear and love, and follow home?\nHe looked upon you FIRST, but recognized that you were not complete. And so He\nsought for your completion in each living thing that He beholds and loves. And\nseeks it still, that each might offer YOU the Love of God.\n\nYet is He quiet, for He knows that Love is in you now, and safely held\nin you by that same hand that holds your brother's in your own. Christ's hand\nholds all His brothers in Himself. He gives them vision for their sightless eyes,\nand sings to them of Heaven, that their ears may hear no more the sound of battle\nand of death. He reaches through them, holding out His hand, that everyone may\nbless all living things, and see their holiness. And He rejoices that these\nsights are YOURS, to look upon with Him and share His joy. His perfect LACK of\nspecialness He offers you, that you may save all living things from death,\nreceiving from each one the gift of Life that your forgiveness offers to your\nSelf.\n\nThe sight of Christ is all there is to see. The song of Christ is all\nthere is to hear. The hand of Christ is all there is to hold. There is no journey\nbut to walk with Him. You who would be content with specialness, and seek\nsalvation in a war with Love, consider this: The holy Lord of Heaven has Himself\ncome down to you to offer you your own completion. What is His is yours, because\nin your completion is His Own. He Who willed not to be without His Son could\nnever will that you be Brotherless. And would He give a Brother unto you except\nhe be as perfect as yourself, and just as like to Him in holiness as YOU must be?\n\nThere must be doubt BEFORE there can be conflict. And EVERY doubt must\nbe about yourself. Christ HAS no doubt, and from His certainty His quiet comes.\nHe will exchange His certainty for ALL your doubts, if you agree that He is one\nwith you, and that this Oneness is endless, timeless, and within your grasp\nBECAUSE your hands are His. He is within you, yet He walks beside you and before,\nleading the way that He must go to find Himself complete. His quietness becomes\nYOUR certainty. And where is doubt, when certainty has come?",

    "content": "Salvation from Fear\n\nBefore your brother's holiness the world is still, and peace descends\non it in gentleness and blessing so complete, that not one trace of conflict\nstill remains to haunt you in the darkness of the night. He is your Savior from\nthe dreams of terror. He is the healing of your sense of sacrifice, and fear that\nwhat you have will scatter with the wind, and turn to dust. In him is your\nassurance God is here, and with you now. While he is what he is, you can be sure\nthat God is knowable, and WILL be known to you. For He could never leave His own\ncreation. And the sign that this is so lies in your brother, offered you that all\nyour doubts about yourself may disappear before his holiness.\n\nSee in him God's creation. For in him his Father waits for your\nacknowledgment that He created YOU as part of Him. Without you, there would be a\nlack in God, a Heaven incomplete, a Son without a Father. There could be no\nuniverse, and no reality. For what God wills is whole, and part of Him BECAUSE\nHis Will is One. Nothing alive that is not part of Him, and nothing is but IS\nalive in Him. Your brother's holiness shows you that God is One with him AND you;\nthat what he has is yours BECAUSE you are not separate from him OR from his\nFather.\n\nNothing is lost to you in all the universe. Nothing that God created\nhas He failed to lay before you lovingly, as yours forever. And no thought within\nHis Mind is absent from your own. It is His Will you SHARE His love for you, and\nlook upon yourself as lovingly as He conceived of you before the world began, and\nas He knows you still. God changes not His Mind about His Son with passing\ncircumstance which has no meaning in eternity where He abides, and you with Him.\nYour brother IS as He created him. And it is this that saves YOU from a world\nthat He created not.\n\nForget not that the healing of God's Son is all the world is for. That\nis the ONLY purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it, and thus the only one it HAS.\nUntil you see the healing of the Son as all you wish to be accomplished by the\nworld, by time, and ALL appearances, you will NOT know the Father OR yourself.\nFor you will use the world for what is NOT its purpose, and will NOT escape its\nlaws of violence and death. Yet it is GIVEN you to be BEYOND its laws in ALL\nrespects, in EVERY way, and EVERY circumstance; in ALL temptation to perceive\nwhat is NOT there, and ALL belief God's Son can suffer pain because he sees\nhimself as he is not.\n\nLook on your brother, and behold in him the whole reversal of the laws\nthat SEEM to rule this world. See in his freedom YOURS, for such it IS. Let not\nhis specialness obscure the truth in him, for not one law of death you bind him\nto will YOU escape. And not one sin you see in him but keeps you BOTH in hell.\nYet will his perfect sinlessness RELEASE you both, for holiness is quite\nimpartial, with one judgment made for all it looks upon. And that is made, not of\nitself, but through the Voice that speaks for God in everything that lives, and\nshares His Being.\n\nIt is HIS sinlessness that eyes that see can look upon. It is HIS\nloveliness they see in everything. And it is HE they look for everywhere, and\nfind no sight or place or time where He is NOT. Within your brother's holiness,\nthe perfect frame for YOUR salvation and the world's, is set the shining memory\nof Him in Whom your brother lives, and you along with him. Let not your eyes be\nblinded by the veil of specialness that hides the face of Christ from him, and\nyou as well. And let the fear of God no longer hold the vision you were MEANT to\nsee from you. Your brother's BODY shows not Christ to you. He IS set forth within\nhis holiness.\n\nChoose, then, his body OR his holiness as what you WANT to see, and\nwhich you choose is yours to look upon. Yet will you choose in countless\nsituations, and through time which seems to have no end, until the truth be your\ndecision. For eternity is NOT regained by still one more denial of the Christ in\nhim. And where is YOUR salvation, if he is but a body? Where is YOUR peace, but\nin his holiness? And where is God Himself but in that part of Him He set forever\nin your brother's holiness, that YOU might see the truth about yourself set forth\nat last in terms you recognized and understood?\n\nYour brother's holiness is sacrament and benediction unto YOU. His\nerrors can NOT withhold God's blessing from himself, nor you who see him truly.\nHis mistakes can cause delay, which it is given YOU to take from him, that both\nmay end a journey that has never been begun, and NEEDS no end. What never was is\nNOT a part of you. Yet will you think it is, until you realize that it is not a\npart of him who stands beside you. He is the mirror of yourself, wherein you see\nthe judgment you have laid on BOTH of you. The Christ in you beholds his\nholiness. Your specialness looks on his body, and beholds him not.\n\nSee him as what he IS, that YOUR deliverance may not be long. A\nsenseless wandering, without a purpose and without accomplishment of any kind, is\nall the other choice can offer you. Futility of function not fulfilled will haunt\nyou while your brother lies asleep, 'til what has been assigned to you is done,\nand he is risen from the past. He who condemned himself, and you as well, is\ngiven you to save from condemnation, along with you. And both shall see God's\nglory in His Son, whom you mistook as flesh, and bound to laws that have NO power\nover him at all.\n\nWould you not gladly realize these laws are not for YOU? Then see HIM\nnot as prisoner to them. It CANNOT be what governs part of God holds not for all\nthe rest. You place YOURSELF under the laws you see as ruling HIM. Think, then,\nhow great the Love of God for YOU must be, that\nHe has given you a part of Him, to save from pain and give YOU happiness. And\nnever doubt but that your specialness will disappear before the Will of God Who\nloves each part of Him with equal love and care. The Christ in you CAN see your\nbrother truly. And would you decide AGAINST the holiness He sees?\n\nSpecialness is the function that you gave yourself. It stands for you\nalone, as self-created, self-maintained, in need of nothing, and unjoined with\nanything beyond the body. In its eyes, you are a separate universe, with all the\npower to hold itself complete within itself, with every entry shut against\nintrusion, and every window barred against the light. Always attacked and always\nfurious, with anger always fully justified, you have pursued this goal with\nvigilance you never thought to yield, and effort that you never thought to cease.\nAnd all this grim determination was for this: YOU WANTED SPECIALNESS TO BE THE\nTRUTH.\n\nNow you are merely asked that you pursue another goal with far LESS\nvigilance, with little effort and with little time, and with the power of God\nmaintaining it, and promising success. Yet, of the two, it is THIS one you find\nmore difficult. The SACRIFICE of self you understand, nor do you deem THIS cost\ntoo heavy. But a tiny willingness, a nod to God, a greeting to the Christ in you,\nyou find a burden wearisome and tedious, too heavy to be borne. Yet, to the\ndedication to the truth as GOD established it, NO sacrifice is asked, NO strain\ncalled forth, and all the power of Heaven and the might of truth itself is given\nto provide the means, and GUARANTEE the goal's accomplishment.\n\nYou who believe it easier to see your brother's body than his\nholiness, be sure you understand what made this judgment. Here is the voice of\nspecialness heard clearly, judging AGAINST the Christ, and setting forth, for\nYOU, the purpose that you CAN attain, and what you can NOT do. Forget not that\nthis\njudgment MUST apply to what you do with IT as your ally. For what you do through\nChrist it does not know. To Him, this judgment makes no sense at all, for ONLY",

    "content": "The Meeting-Place\n\nHow bitterly does everyone tied to this world defend the specialness\nhe WANTS to be the truth! His wish is law to him, and he obeys. Nothing his\nspecialness demands does he withhold. Nothing it needs does he deny to what he\nloves. And, while it calls to him, he hears no other Voice. No effort is too\ngreat, no cost too much, no price too dear, to save his specialness from the\nleast slight, the tiniest attack, the whispered doubt, the hint of threat, or\nanything but deepest reverence. This is your son, beloved of you as you are to\nyour Father. Yet it stands in place of your creations, who ARE Son to you, that\nyou might SHARE the Fatherhood of God, not snatch it FROM Him.\n\nWhat IS this son that you have made to be your strength? What is this\nchild of earth, on whom such love is lavished? What is this parody of God's\ncreation, that takes the place of YOURS? And where are THEY, now that the host of\nGod has found another son that he prefers to them? The memory of God shines not\nalone. What is within your brother still contains ALL of creation, everything\ncreated and creating, born and unborn as yet, still in the future or apparently\ngone by. What is in him is changeless, and YOUR changelessness is recognized in\nits acknowledgment. The holiness in you belongs to him. And, BY your seeing it in\nhim, returns to YOU.\n\nAll of the tribute you have given specialness belongs to him, and thus\nreturns to you. All of the love and care, the strong protection, the thought by\nday and night, the deep concern, the powerful conviction this is you, belong to\nhim. Nothing you gave to specialness but is HIS due. And nothing due him is NOT\ndue to you. How will you KNOW your worth, while specialness claims you instead?\nHow can you FAIL to know it, in his holiness? Seek not to make your specialness\nthe truth, for, if it were, you would be lost indeed. Be thankful, rather, it is\ngiven you to see\nhis holiness BECAUSE it is the truth. And what is true in him MUST be as true in\nyou.\n\nT 24 H 4. Ask yourself this: CAN YOU PROTECT THE MIND? The body, yes, a little;\nnot from time, but temporarily. And much you think to save, you hurt. What would\nyou save it FOR? For, in that choice, lie both its health AND harm. Save it for\nshow, as bait to catch another fish, to house your specialness in better style,\nor weave a frame of loveliness around your hate, and you condemn it to decay and\npain. And, if you see this purpose in your brother's, such is your condemnation\nof your own. Weave rather, then, a frame of holiness around him, that the truth\nmay shine in him, and give YOU safety from decay.\n\nThe Father keeps what HE created safe. YOU cannot touch it with the\nfalse ideas you made, BECAUSE it was created not by you. Let not your foolish\nfancies frighten you. What is immortal cannot BE attacked; what is but temporal\nHAS no effect. Only the PURPOSE that you see in it has meaning, and, if THAT is\ntrue, its safety rests secure. If not, it HAS no purpose, and is means for\nnothing. Whatever is perceived as means for truth SHARES in its holiness, and\nrests in light as safely as Itself. Nor will that light go out when it is gone.\nIts holy purpose GAVE it immortality, setting another light in Heaven, where your\ncreations recognize a gift from YOU, a sign that you have NOT forgotten them.\n\nT 24 H 6. The test of EVERYTHING on earth is simply this: “What is it FOR?” The\nanswer makes it what it IS for you. It has NO meaning of itself, yet you can GIVE\nreality to it, according to the purpose which YOU serve. Here, YOU are but means,\nalong with it. God is a Means as well as End. In Heaven, means and end are one,\nand One with Him. This is the state of true creation, found not within time, but\nin eternity. To no-one here is this describable. Nor is there any way to learn\nwhat this condition means. Not 'til you go PAST learning to the Given; not 'til\nyou make again\na holy home for YOUR creations is it understood.\n\nA co-creator with the Father must have a Son. Yet must this Son have\nbeen created like Himself. A perfect Being, all-encompassing and all-encompassed,\nnothing to add and nothing taken FROM; not born of size nor weight nor time, nor\nheld to limits or uncertainties of ANY kind. Here do the means and end unite as\nOne, nor does this One have any end at all. All this is true, and yet it has no\nmeaning to anyone who still retains one unlearned lesson in his memory; one\nthought with purpose still uncertain, or one wish with a divided aim.\n\nThis course makes no attempt to teach what cannot easily be learned.\nIts scope does not exceed your own. Except to say that what is yours will come to\nyou when you are ready. Here, are the means and purpose separate, because they\nwere so made and so perceived. And therefore do we deal with them as if they\nwere. It is essential it be kept in mind that ALL perception still is upsidedown,\nuntil its PURPOSE has been understood. Perception does not SEEM to be a\nmeans. And it is this that makes it hard to grasp the whole extent to which it\nMUST depend on what you use it FOR.\n\nPerception seems to TEACH you what you see. Yet it but witnesses to\nwhat YOU taught. It is the outward picture of a wish, an image that you WANTED to\nbe true. Look at yourself, and you will see a body. Look at this body in a\ndifferent light, and it looks different. And without a light, it seems that it is\ngone. Yet you are reassured that it is there, because you still can feel it with\nyour hands, and hear it move.\n\nHere is an image that you WANT to be yourself. It is the means to make\nyour wish come true. It GIVES the eyes with which you look on it, the hands that\nfeel it, and the ears with which you listened to the sounds it makes. IT PROVES\nITS OWN REALITY TO YOU. Thus is the body made a THEORY of yourself, with NO\nprovisions made for evidence BEYOND itself, and NO escape within\nits sight. Its course is sure, when seen through its own eyes. It grows and\nwithers, flourishes and dies. And you cannot conceive of you APART from it. You\nbrand it sinful, and you hate its acts, judging it evil. Yet your specialness\nwhispers, “Here is my own beloved son, with whom I am well pleased.”\n\nThus does the son become the MEANS to serve his father's purpose. NOT\nidentical, not even like, but still a means to offer to the father WHAT HE WANTS.\nSuch is the travesty on God's creation. For, as His Son's creation gave HIM joy,\nand witness to HIS Love and shared HIS Purpose, so does the body testify to the\nidea that made it, and speak for ITS reality and truth. And thus are two sons\nmade, and BOTH appear to walk this earth without a meeting place, and NO\nencounter. One do you see OUTSIDE yourself, your OWN beloved son. The other rests\nwithin, His Father's Son, within your brother as he is in you.\n\nTheir difference does not lie in how they look, or where they go, or\neven what they do. THEY SHARE A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. It is this that joins them to\ntheir like, and separates each from all aspects with a DIFFERENT purpose. The Son\nof God retains his Father's Will. The son of man perceives an alien will, AND\nWISHES IT WERE SO. And thus does his perception serve his wish, by giving it\nAPPEARANCES of truth. Yet can perception serve ANOTHER goal. It is not bound to\nspecialness, but by your choice. And it IS given you to make a different choice,\nand use perception FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE. And what you see will serve that\npurpose well, and prove ITS own reality to you.",

And\nit is certain that YOU cannot be APART from what is at the very CENTER of your\nlife. What gives you life cannot be housed in death. NO MORE CAN YOU. Christ is\nwithin a frame of holiness, whose ONLY purpose is that He may be made manifest to\nthose who know Him not; that He may call to them to come to Him, and see Him\nwhere they THOUGHT their bodies were. Then will their bodies melt away, that they\nmay frame His holiness in them.\n\nNo-one who carries Christ in him can fail to recognize Him everywhere.\nEXCEPT IN BODIES. And, as long as they believe THEY are in bodies, where they\nthink they are He CANNOT be. And so they carry Him unknowingly, and do not make\nHim manifest. And thus they do not recognize Him where He IS. The son of man is\nNOT the risen Christ. Yet does the Son of God abide EXACTLY where he is, and\nwalks with him, within his holiness, as plain to see as is his specialness set\nforth within his body.\n\nThe body needs NO healing. But the mind that thinks it IS a body is\nsick indeed! And it is here that Christ sets forth the remedy. His PURPOSE folds\nthe body in His light, and fills it with the holiness that shines from HIM.

And, in the DOING of it, will you learn the\nbody merely SEEMS to be the means to do it. For the Mind is HIS. And so it MUST\nbe yours. HIS holiness directs the body THROUGH the mind at one with Him. And YOU\nare manifest unto your holy brother, as he to you. Here is the meeting of the\nholy Christ unto Himself. Nor ANY differences perceived to stand between the\naspects of His holiness, which meet and join, and raise Him to His Father, whole\nand pure, and worthy of His Everlasting Love.\n\nHow can you manifest the Christ in you, EXCEPT you look on holiness,\nand see Him there? Perception tells you YOU are manifest in what you see. Behold\nthe body, and you WILL believe that you are there. And every body that you look\nupon reminds you of yourself; YOUR sinfullness, YOUR evil, and, above all YOUR\ndeath. And would you not despise the one who tells you this, and seek HIS death\ninstead? The message and the messenger ARE one. And you MUST see your brother as\nyourself. Framed in his body you will see YOUR sinfullness, wherein YOU stand\ncondemned. Set in his holiness, the Christ in him proclaims HIMSELF as you.\n\nPerception is a choice of what you want YOURSELF to be; the world you\nWANT to live in, and the state in which you think your mind will be content and\nsatisfied. It chooses where you think your safety lies, AT YOUR DECISION. It\nreveals yourself to you, as YOU would have you be.\nAnd ALWAYS is it faithful to your purpose, from which it never separates, nor\ngives the slightest witness unto anything the purpose IN YOUR MIND upholdeth not.\nPerception is a PART of what it is your purpose to behold, for means and end are\nNEVER separate. And thus you learn what SEEMS to have a life APART has none.\n\nYOU are the means for God. NOT separate, nor with a life apart from\nHis. HIS Life is manifest in you who are His Son. Each aspect of Himself is\nframed in holiness and perfect purity, in love celestial and so complete It\nwishes ONLY that It may release ALL that It looks upon unto Itself. Its radiance\nshines through each body that It looks upon, and brushes ALL its darkness into\nlight merely by looking PAST it TO the Light. The veil is lifted through Its\ngentleness, and NOTHING hides the face of Christ from its beholders. And BOTH of\nyou stand there before Him now, to let HIM draw aside the veil that SEEMS to keep\nyou separate and apart.\n\nSince you believe that YOU are separate, Heaven presents itself to you\nas separate, too. NOT that it is the truth, but that the link that has been given\nyou to JOIN the truth may reach to you through what you understand. Father and\nSon and Holy Spirit are as One, as all your brothers join as one in truth. Christ\nand His Father NEVER have been separate, and Christ abides within your\nunderstanding, in the part of you that SHARES His Father's Will. The Holy Spirit\nlinks the other part, the tiny, mad desire to be separate, different, and\nspecial, TO the Christ, to make the Oneness clear to what is REALLY One. In this\nworld, this is not understood, but CAN be taught.\n\nThe Holy Spirit serves Christ's purpose in your mind, so that the aim\nof specialness CAN be corrected where the error lies. Because His purpose still\nis One with both the Father AND the Son, He KNOWS the Will of God, and what you\nREALLY will. But this is understood by mind PERCEIVED as one, AWARE that it is\none, AND SO EXPERIENCED. It is the Holy Spirit's function to teach you HOW this\nOneness is experienced; WHAT you must do that it can BE experienced; and WHERE\nyou should go to do it. All this takes note of time and place AS IF they were\ndiscrete, for while YOU think that part of YOU is separate, the concept of a\nOneness JOINED as one is meaningless.\n\nIt is apparent that a mind so split could NEVER be the teacher of the\nOneness Which unites ALL things within Itself. And so what IS within this mind,\nand DOES unite all things together MUST be its teacher. Yet must It use the\nlanguage which this mind can understand in the condition which it THINKS it is.\nAnd It must use all learning to transfer illusions TO the truth, taking all FALSE",

Perhaps you fancy\nto attain some peace and satisfaction in the world as YOU perceive it. Yet it\nMUST be evident the outcome DOES NOT CHANGE. Despite your hopes and fancies,\nALWAYS does despair result. And there is NO exception, nor will there ever be.\nThe ONLY value that the past can hold is that you learn it gave you NO rewards\nthat you would WANT to keep, for only thus will you be WILLING to relinquish it,\nand have it gone forever.\n\nIs it not strange that you should cherish still some hope of\nsatisfaction from the world you see? In NO respect, at ANY time or place, has\nANYTHING but fear and guilt been your reward. How long is needed for you to\nrealize the chance of CHANGE in this regard is hardly worth delaying change that\nmight result in better outcome? For one thing is sure; the way YOU see, and long\nHAVE seen, gives NO support to base your future hopes, and NO suggestions of\nsuccess at all. To place your hopes where no hope lies MUST make you hopeless.\nYet is this hopelessness your choice, while you would seek for hope where none is\nEVER found.\n\nIs it not ALSO true that you have found some hope APART from this;\nsome glimmering, inconstant, wavering, yet dimly seen, that hopefulness IS\nwarranted, on grounds that are NOT in this world? And yet your hope that they may\nSTILL lie here prevents you still from giving up the hopeless and unrewarding\ntask you set YOURSELF. Can it make sense to hold the fixed belief that there IS\nreason to uphold pursuit of what has ALWAYS failed, on grounds that it will\nsuddenly succeed, and bring what it has NEVER brought before?\n\nIts past HAS failed. Be glad that it is gone within your mind to\ndarken what IS there. Take not the form for content, for the form is but a MEANS\nfor content. And the frame is but a means to hold the picture up, so that it can\nbe seen. A frame that HIDES the picture HAS no purpose. It cannot BE a frame if\nIT is what you see. WITHOUT the picture is the frame without its meaning. Its\nPURPOSE is to set the PICTURE off, and NOT itself. Who hangs an empty frame upon\na wall, and stands before it, deep in reverence, as if a masterpiece were there\nto see?\n\nYet, if you see your brother as a body, it IS but this you do. The\nmasterpiece that God has set within this frame is all there IS to see. The body\nholds it, for a while, without obscuring it in any way. But what God has created\nNEEDS no frame, for what He has created HE supports, and frames within Himself.\nHis masterpiece He offers YOU to see. And would you rather see the frame INSTEAD\nof this? And see the picture not at all? The Holy Spirit is the frame God set\naround the part of Him that YOU would see as separate. Yet its frame is JOINED to\nits Creator, One with Him AND with His masterpiece.\n\nThis IS its purpose, and you do NOT make the frame INTO the picture,\nwhen you choose to see it in its place. The frame that God has given it but\nserves HIS purpose, not yours APART from His. It is your SEPARATE purpose that\nOBSCURES the picture, and cherishes the frame INSTEAD of it. But God has set His\nmasterpiece within a frame that will endure forever, when yours has crumbled into\ndust. But think you not the picture is destroyed in ANY way. What God creates is\nsafe from ALL corruption, unchanged and perfect in eternity.\n\nAccept HIS frame instead of yours, and you WILL see the masterpiece.\nLook at its loveliness, and understand the Mind that thought it, NOT in flesh and\nbones, but in a frame as lovely as Itself. Its holiness lights up the sinlessness\nthe frame of darkness hides, and casts a veil of light across the picture's face,\nwhich but reflects the light which shines from it to its Creator. Think not this\nface was ever darkened because YOU saw it in a frame of death. God kept it safe\nthat YOU might look on it, and SEE the holiness that He has given it. Within the\ndarkness see the Savior FROM the dark, and understand your brother as his\nFather's Mind shows him to you.\n\nHe will step forth from darkness as you look on him, and YOU will see\nthe dark no more. The darkness touched him not, nor you who BROUGHT him forth for\nYOU to look upon. His sinlessness but pictures YOURS. His gentleness becomes YOUR\nstrength, and BOTH will gladly look within and see the holiness that MUST be\nthere BECAUSE of what you looked upon in him. HE is the frame in which YOUR\nholiness is set, and what God gave him MUST be given you. However much he\noverlooks the masterpiece in him, and sees only a frame of darkness, it is still\nYOUR only function to behold in him what he sees not. And, in this seeing, is the\nvision SHARED that looks on Christ INSTEAD of seeing death.\n\nHow could the Lord of Heaven NOT be glad if you appreciate His\nmasterpiece? What COULD He do but offer thanks to you, who love His Son as He\ndoes? Would He not make KNOWN to you His Love, if you but SHARE His praise of\nwhat He loves? God cherishes\ncreation as the perfect Father that He is. And so His joy is made complete when\nany part of Him JOINS in His praise, to SHARE His joy. This brother is His\nperfect gift to you. And He is glad and thankful when you thank His perfect Son\nfor being what he IS. And ALL His thanks and gladness shine on you who would\nCOMPLETE His joy, along with Him.\n\nAnd thus is YOURS completed. Not one ray of darkness can be seen by\nthose who will to make their Father's happiness complete, and theirs along with\nHis. The gratitude of God Himself is freely offered to everyone who shares His\nPurpose. It was not His Will to be alone. And neither is it YOURS. Forgive your\nbrother, and you CANNOT separate yourself from him, nor from his Father. YOU need\nNO forgiveness, for the wholly pure have never sinned. Give, then, what He has\ngiven you, that YOU may see His Son as one, and thank his Father, as He thanks\nYOU. Nor believe that all His praise is given not to you. For what you give is\nHIS, and giving it, you learn to understand His gift to you. And give the Holy\nSpirit what He offers unto the Father AND the Son alike.\n\nNothing has power over you EXCEPT His Will AND yours, who but EXTEND\nHis Will. It was for this YOU were created, and your brother WITH you, and ONE\nwith you. YOU are the same, as God Himself is One, and NOT divided in His Will.\nAnd YOU must have one purpose, since He gave the same to BOTH of you. His Will is\nbrought together as you join in will that you be made complete by offering\ncompletion to your brother.

    "content": "The Fundamental Law of Perception\n\nTo the extent to which you value guilt, to that extent will you\nperceive a world in which attack is justified. To the extent to which you\nrecognize that guilt is meaningless, to that extent will you perceive attack\ncannot BE justified. This is in strict accord with vision's FUNDAMENTAL law: You\nsee what you believe is there, and you believe it there because you WANT it\nthere. Perception HAS no other law than this. The rest but stem from this, to\nhold it up and offer it support. This is perception's form, adapted to this\nworld, of God's more basic law; that Love creates Itself, and nothing BUT Itself.\n\nGod's laws do not obtain directly to a world perception rules, for\nsuch a world could not have been created by the Mind to which perception has no\nmeaning. Yet are His laws reflected everywhere. NOT that the world where this\nreflection is, is real at all. ONLY because His Son BELIEVES it is, and from His\nSon's belief He COULD not let Himself be separate entirely. He could not enter\nHis Son's insanity with him, but He could be sure His sanity went there WITH him,\nso he could not be lost forever in the madness of his wish.\n\nPerception rests on choosing; knowledge does not. Knowledge has but\none law BECAUSE it has but One Creator. But this world has two who made it, and\nthey do NOT see it as the same. To each it has a DIFFERENT purpose, and to each\nit is a perfect means to serve the goal for which it is perceived. For\nspecialness it is the perfect frame to set it off; the perfect battleground to\nwage its wars, the perfect shelter for the illusions which it would make real.\nNot one but it upholds in its perception; not one but can be fully justified.\n\nThere is another Maker of the world, the simultaneous Corrector of the\nmad belief that ANYTHING could be established and maintained without some link\nthat kept it still within the Laws of God. NOT as the Law Itself\nupholds the universe as God created it. But in some form adapted to the need the\nSon of God believes he has. Corrected error IS the error's end. And thus has God\nprotected still His Son, even in error. There IS another purpose in the world\nthat error made because it has another Maker, Who CAN reconcile its goal with His\nCreator's Purpose.\n\nIn His perception of the world, nothing is seen but justifies\nforgiveness and the sight of perfect sinlessness. Nothing arises but is met with\ninstant and complete forgiveness. Nothing remains an instant, to obscure the\nsinlessness that shines unchanged, beyond the pitiful attempts of specialness to\nput it out of mind, where it MUST be, and light the BODY up INSTEAD of it. The\nlamps of Heaven are NOT for it to choose to see them where it will. If it elects\nto see them elsewhere from their home, as if they lit a place where they could\nnever be, AND YOU AGREE, then must the Maker of the world correct your error,\nlest you still remain in darkness, where the lamps are NOT.\n\nEveryone here has entered darkness, yet no-one has entered it alone.\nNor need he stay more than an instant. For he has come with Heaven's help within\nhim, ready to lead him OUT of darkness into light at ANY time. The time he\nchooses can be ANY time, for help is there, awaiting but his choice. And when he\nchooses to AVAIL himself of what is given him, then will he see each situation\nthat he thought before was means to justify his anger, turned to an event which\njustifies his love.\n\nHe will hear plainly that the calls to war he heard before are really\ncalls to peace. He will perceive that where he gave attack is but another altar\nwhere he can, with equal ease and FAR more happiness, bestow forgiveness. And he\nwill re-interpret ALL temptation as just another chance to bring him joy.\nHow CAN a misperception be a sin? Let ALL your brother's errors be to you nothing\nexcept a chance for YOU to see the workings of the Helper given YOU to see the\nworld HE made, instead of yours.\n\nWhat, then, is justified? WHAT DO YOU WANT? For these two questions\nARE the same, and, when you see them AS the same, your choice is made. For it is\nSEEING them as one that brings release from the belief there are two ways to see.\nThis world has much to offer to your peace, and many chances to extend your own\nforgiveness. Such its PURPOSE is, to those who WANT to see peace and forgiveness\ndescend on THEM, and offer THEM the light. The Maker of the world of gentleness\nhas perfect power to offset the world of violence and hate that SEEMS to stand\nBETWEEN you and His gentleness. It is not there in His forgiving eyes. And\nTHEREFORE it need not be there in yours.\n\nSin is the fixed belief perception CANNOT change. What has been damned\nIS damned, and damned forever, BEING FOREVER UNFORGIVABLE. If, then, it IS\nforgiven, sin's perception MUST have been wrong. And thus is change made\npossible. The Holy Spirit, too, sees what HE sees as far beyond the chance of\nchange. But on His Vision sin can NOT encroach. For sin HAS BEEN corrected by His\nsight. And thus IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN ERROR, NOT a sin. For what it claimed could\nnever be, HAS BEEN. Sin is ATTACKED by punishment, and so PRESERVED. But to\nFORGIVE it is to change its state from error into truth.\n\nThe Son of God could NEVER sin, but he CAN wish for what would hurt\nhim. And he HAS the power to think he CAN BE hurt. What could this be EXCEPT a\nmisperception of himself? Is this a sin or a mistake; forgivable or not? Does he\nneed help or condemnation? Is it YOUR purpose that he be saved or damned?\nForgetting not that what he is to YOU will make this",

And thus they seek for\nit, because it is their PURPOSE to behold it and rejoice. Everyone seeks for what\nwill bring him joy as he defines it. It is NOT the aim, as such, that varies. Yet\nit IS the way in which the aim is seen that makes the choice of means inevitable,\nand beyond the hope of change UNLESS THE AIM IS CHANGED.

Perception's basic law could thus be said: “You will rejoice at what\nyou see BECAUSE you see it TO rejoice.” And, while you think that suffering and\nsin will bring you joy, so long will they be there for you to see. Nothing is\nharmful or beneficent APART from what you wish. It is your wish that MAKES it\nwhat it is in its effect on you, BECAUSE you chose it as a means to GAIN these\nsame effects, believing them to be the bringers of rejoicing and of joy.

This world you bring with you to all the weary eyes and\ntired hearts that look on sin and beat its sad refrain. From you can come their\nrest. From you can rise a world they will rejoice to look upon, and where their\nhearts are glad. In you there is a Vision which extends to all of them, and\ncovers them in gentleness and light. And in this widening world of light the\ndarkness they THOUGHT was there is pushed away, until it is but distant shadows,\nfar away, not long to be remembered, as the sun shines them to nothingness.\n\nAnd all their evil thoughts and sinful hopes, their dreams of guilt\nand merciless revenge, and every wish to hurt and kill and die, will disappear\nbefore the sun you bring. Would you not do this, for the Love of God? And for\nYOURSELF? For think what it would do for YOU. YOUR evil thoughts that haunt YOU\nnow will seem increasingly remote, and far away from YOU. And they go farther and\nfarther off, because the sun in you has risen that they may be pushed away before\nits light. They linger for a while, a LITTLE while, in twisted forms too far away\nfor recognition, and are gone forever.\n\nAnd in the sunlight YOU will stand in quiet, in innocence and wholly\nunafraid. And from you will the rest YOU found extend, so that YOUR peace can\nnever fall away, and leave YOU homeless. Those who offer peace to everyone have\nfound a home in Heaven the world can NOT destroy. For it is large enough to hold\nthe world within its peace. In YOU is all of Heaven; every leaf that falls is\ngiven life in you. Each bird that ever sang will sing again in you. And every\nflower that ever bloomed has saved its perfume and its loveliness for you.\n\nWhat aim can supersede the Will of God and of His Son, that Heaven be\nrestored to him for whom it was created as his ONLY home? Nothing before and\nnothing after it. No other place, no other state nor time. Nothing beyond nor\nnearer. Nothing else. In ANY form. This can YOU bring to ALL the world, and ALL\nthe thoughts that entered it, and were mistaken for a little while.

The state of sinlessness is merely this: The WHOLE desire to attack is\ngone, and so there is no reason to perceive the Son of God as other than he is.\nThe NEED for guilt is gone, because it has no purpose, and is meaningless without\nthe goal of sin. Attack and sin are bound as ONE illusion, each the cause and aim\nand JUSTIFIER of the other. Each is meaningless alone, but SEEMS to draw a\nmeaning from the other. Each depends upon the other for whatever sense it seems\nto have. And no-one COULD believe in one unless the other were the truth, for\neach attests the other MUST be true.\n\nAttack makes Christ your enemy, and God along with Him. MUST you not\nbe afraid, with enemies like these? And must you not be fearful of YOURSELF? For\nyou HAVE hurt yourself, and made your Self your enemy. And now you MUST believe\nyou are not you, but something alien to yourself and “something else,” a\n“something” to be feared instead of loved. Who would attack whatever he sees as\nwholly innocent? And who, BECAUSE he wishes to attack, can FAIL to think it MUST\nbe guilty, to DESERVE the wish and leave HIM innocent? And who would see the Son\nof God as innocent, and wish him dead?\n\nChrist stands before you both, each time you look on one another. He\nhas NOT gone because your eyes are closed. But what is there to see by searching\nfor your Savior, seeing Him through sightless eyes? It is NOT Christ you see by\nlooking thus. It is the enemy, CONFUSED with Christ, you look upon. And HATE\nBECAUSE there is no sin in him for you to see. Nor do you hear his plaintive\ncall, unchanged in content in WHATEVER form the call is made, that you UNITE with\nhim, and JOIN with him\nin innocence and peace. And yet, beneath the ego's senseless shrieks, such IS the\nCall that God has given him, that YOU might hear in him His Call to YOU, and\nanswer by returning unto God what is His own.\n\nThe Son of God asks only this of you; that you return to him what is\nhis due, that you may SHARE in it with him. Alone, does NEITHER have it. So must\nit remain useless to both. Together, it will give to each an EQUAL strength to\nsave the other, and save himself along WITH him. FORGIVEN by you, your Savior\noffers YOU salvation. CONDEMNED by you, he offers death to you. In everyone you\nsee but the reflection of what you chose to have HIM be to you. If you decide\nagainst his proper function, the ONLY one he really has in truth, you are\ndepriving him of all the joy he WOULD have found if he fulfilled the role God\ngave to him. But think not Heaven is lost to him alone. Nor can it be regained\nunless the way is shown to him through YOU, that YOU may find it, walking by his\nside.\n\nIt is no sacrifice that he be saved, for BY his freedom will you gain\nyour own. To let HIS function be fulfilled is but the means to let YOURS be. And\nso you walk towards Heaven or towards hell, but NOT alone. How beautiful his\nsinlessness will be, when you perceive it! And how great will be YOUR joy when he\nis free to offer you the gift of sight God gave to him for you. He HAS no need\nbut this; that you allow him freedom to complete the task God gave to him.\nRemembering but this; that what HE does YOU do, along with him. And AS you see\nhim, so do YOU define\nthe function he will have for you, until you see him differently, and LET him be\nwhat God APPOINTED that he be to you.\n\nAgainst the hatred that the Son of God may cherish toward himself is\nGod believed to be without the power to save what He created from the pain of\nhell. But in the love he shows himself is God made free to LET His Will be done.\nIn each of you, you see the picture of your OWN belief of what the Will of God\nMUST be for you. In YOUR forgiveness will you understand His Love for you.\nThrough your ATTACK, believe He hates you, thinking Heaven must be hell. Look\nonce again upon your brother, NOT without the understanding that he is the way to\nHeaven or to hell, as YOU perceive him. But forget not this; the role you give to\nhim is given YOU, and YOU will walk the way you pointed out to him, BECAUSE it is\nyour judgment made upon yourself.",

He would no more condemn himself for\nHIS mistakes than damn another. He is not an arbiter of vengeance, nor a punisher\nof sin.

Yet this is NOT what eyes are\nFOR. And who can say that he PREFERS the darkness, and maintain he WANTS to see?\n\nThe WISH to see calls down the grace of God upon your eyes, and brings\nthe gift of light that makes sight possible. Will you behold your brother? God is\nglad to have you look on him. He does not will your Savior be unrecognized by\nyou. Nor does He will that he remain without the function that He gave to him.\nLet him no more be lonely, for the lonely ones are those who see no function in\nthe world for them to fill; no place where they are needed, and no aim which ONLY\nthey can perfectly fulfill.\n\nSuch is the Holy Spirit's kind perception of specialness; His use of\nwhat you made, to heal INSTEAD of harm. To each He gives a special function in\nsalvation he alone can fill; a part for ONLY him. Nor is the plan complete until\nhe finds his special function, and fulfills the part assigned to him, to make\nhimself complete within a world where incompletion rules. Here, where the laws of\nGod do NOT prevail in perfect form, can he yet do ONE perfect thing, and make ONE\nperfect choice. And, BY this act of special faithfullness, to one perceived as\nOTHER than himself, he learns the gift was given TO himself, and so they MUST be\none.\n\nForgiveness is the ONLY function meaningful in time. It is the means\nthe Holy Spirit uses to TRANSLATE specialness from sin into salvation.\nForgiveness is for all. But, when it RESTS on all, it is complete, and every\nfunction of this world completed with it. Then is time no more. But WHILE in\ntime, there is still much to do. And each must do what is allotted him, for, on\nHIS part, does ALL the plan depend. He HAS a special part in time, for so he\nchose, and choosing it, made it for himself. His wish was not denied, but changed\nin form, to let it serve his brother AND himself, and thus become a means to save\nINSTEAD of lose.\n\nSalvation is no more than a reminder this world is NOT your home; its\nlaws are NOT imposed on you, its values are NOT yours. And nothing that you THINK\nyou see in it is REALLY there at all. And this is seen AND UNDERSTOOD as each one\ntakes his part in its UNDOING, as he did in MAKING it. He HAS the means for\neither, as he always did. The specialness he chose to HURT himself did God\nappoint to be the means for his salvation, from the very instant that the choice\nwas made. His special sin was made his special grace. His special hate became his\nspecial love.\n\nThe Holy Spirit needs YOUR special function, that HIS may be\nfulfilled. Think not you lack a special value here. You wanted it, and it IS\ngiven you. ALL that you made can serve salvation easily and well. The Son of God\ncan make NO choice the Holy Spirit can not employ on his BEHALF, and NOT against\nhimself. Only in darkness does your specialness APPEAR to be attack. In light,\nyou see it is your SPECIAL FUNCTION in the plan to save the Son of God from ALL\nattack, and let him understand that he is safe, as he has ALWAYS been, and will\nremain in time and in eternity alike. This is the function given each of you for",

    "content": "Commuting the Sentence\n\nAnd, if the Holy Spirit can commute each sentence that you laid upon\nyourself into a blessing, then it CANNOT be a sin. Sin is ONE thing in all this\nworld that CANNOT change. It is immutable. And ON its changelessness the world\ndepends. The magic of the world can SEEM to hide the pain of sin from sinners,\nand deceive with glitter and with guile. Yet each one knows the cost of sin is\ndeath. And so it IS. For sin is a REQUEST for death, a wish to make this world's\nfoundation sure as love, dependable as Heaven, and as strong as God Himself. The\nworld IS safe from love to everyone who thinks sin possible. Nor WILL it change.\n\nYet IS it possible what God created NOT should SHARE the attributes of\nHis creation, when it OPPOSES it in every way? It CANNOT be the “sinner's” wish\nfor death is just as strong as is His Will for Life. Nor CAN the basis of a world\nHe did NOT make be firm and sure as Heaven. How COULD it be that hell and Heaven\nare the same? And is it possible that what He did NOT will can NOT be changed?\nWhat is immutable BESIDES His Will? And what can share Its attributes EXCEPT\nItself? What wish can rise AGAINST His Will, and BE immutable?\n\nIf you could realize NOTHING is changeless BUT the Will of God, this\ncourse would not be difficult for you. For it is this that you do not believe.\nYet there is nothing ELSE you COULD believe, if you but looked at what it really\nIS. Let us go back to what we said before, and think of it more carefully. It\nMUST be so that either God is mad, or is this world a place of madness. Not ONE\nThought of His makes ANY sense at all within this world. And NOTHING that the\nworld believes as true has ANY meaning in His Mind at all.\n\nWhat makes no sense and has no meaning IS insanity. And what is\nmadness CANNOT be the truth. If ONE belief so deeply valued here were true, then\nevery Thought God ever had is an illusion. And if but ONE Thought of His is true,\nthen ALL beliefs the world gives ANY meaning to are false, and make no sense at\nall. This IS the choice you make. Do not attempt to see it differently, nor twist\nit into something it is not. For only THIS decision CAN you make. The rest is up\nto God, and NOT to you.\n\nTo justify ONE value that the world upholds is to DENY your Father's\nsanity AND YOURS. For God and His beloved Son do NOT think differently. And it is\nthe AGREEMENT of their Thought that makes the Son a co-creator with the Mind\nWhose Thought created him. And if he chooses to believe ONE thought OPPOSED to\ntruth, he has decided he is NOT his Father's Son, because the Son is mad, and\nsanity must lie apart from both the Father AND the Son. THIS YOU BELIEVE. Think\nnot that this belief depends upon the form it takes. Who thinks the world is sane\nin any way; is justified in ANYTHING it thinks, or is maintained by ANY form of\nreason, believes this to be true.\n\nSin is not real BECAUSE the Father and the Son are NOT insane. This\nworld is meaningless BECAUSE it rests on sin. Who could create the changeless, if\nit does NOT rest on truth? The Holy Spirit HAS the power to change the whole\nfoundation of the world you see to something else; a basis NOT insane, on which a\nsane perception can be based, another world perceived. And one in which is\nnothing contradicted that would lead the Son of God to sanity and joy. Nothing\nattests to death and cruelty; to separation and to differences. For here is\neverything perceived as one, and no-one loses, that each one may gain.\n\nTest EVERYTHING that you believe against this ONE requirement. And\nunderstand that everything that meets this ONE demand is worthy of your faith.\nBut nothing else. What is not love is sin, and either one perceives the other as\ninsane and meaningless. Love is the basis for a world perceived as wholly mad to\nsinners, who believe theirs is the way to sanity. But sin is equally insane\nwithin the sight of love, whose gentle eyes would look BEYOND the madness, and\nrest peacefully on truth. Each sees a world immutable, as each defines the\nchangeless and eternal truth of what YOU are. And each reflects a view of what\nthe Father and the Son MUST be, to make that viewpoint meaningful and sane.\n\nYour special function is the special form in which the fact that God\nis NOT insane appears most sensible and meaningful to you. The CONTENT is the\nsame. The FORM is suited to your special needs, and to the special time and place\nin which you think you find yourself, and where you can be free of place and\ntime, and ALL that you believe must limit you. The Son of God can NOT be bound\nby time or place, or anything God did NOT will. Yet, if His Will is seen as\nmadness, then the FORM of sanity which makes it most acceptable to those who ARE\ninsane requires special choice. Nor CAN this choice be made BY the insane, whose\nproblem IS their choices are NOT free, and made with reason in the light of\nsense.\n\nIt WOULD be madness to entrust salvation to the insane. BECAUSE He is\nnot mad, has God appointed One as sane as He to raise a saner world to meet the\nsight of everyone who chose insanity as his salvation. To this One is given the\nchoice of form most suitable to him; one which will NOT attack the world he sees,\nbut enter into it in quietness, and SHOW him it is mad. This One but points to an\nALTERNATIVE, ANOTHER way of looking at what he has seen before, and recognizes as\nthe world in which he lives, and THOUGHT he understood before. Now MUST he\nquestion this, because the\nform of the alternative is one which he can NOT deny, nor overlook, nor fail\ncompletely to perceive and see at all.\n\nTo each his special function is designed to be perceived as possible,\nand more and more desired, as it PROVES to him that it is an alternative he\nWANTS. From this position does his sinfullness, and ALL the sin he sees within\nthe world, offer him less and less. Until he comes to understand it COST him\nsanity, and stands BETWEEN him and whatever hope he has of BEING sane. Nor is he\nleft without ESCAPE from madness, for he has a special part in EVERYONE'S escape.\nHe can no more be left outside, WITHOUT a special function in the hope of peace,\nthan could the Father overlook His Son, and pass him by in careless\nthoughtlessness.\n\nWhat is dependable EXCEPT His Love? And where does sanity abide EXCEPT\nin Him? The One Who speaks for Him can show you this, in the alternative He chose\nespecially for you. It is God's Will that you remember this, and so emerge from\ndeepest mourning into perfect joy. Accept the function that has been assigned to\nyou in God's Own plan to show His Son that hell and Heaven are different; NOT the\nsame. But that, in Heaven THEY are all the same, WITHOUT the differences that\nWOULD have made a hell of Heaven, and a heaven of hell, had such insanity been\npossible.\n\nThe whole belief that someone loses but reflects the underlying tenet\nGod must be insane. For in this world it seems that one must gain BECAUSE another\nloses. If THIS were true, then God is mad indeed. But what IS this belief, except\na form of the more basic tenet, “Sin is real, and rules the world?” For every\nlittle gain, must someone lose, and pay exact amount in blood and suffering. For\notherwise would evil triumph, and destruction be the total cost of any gain at\nall. You who believe that God is mad, look carefully at this, and understand that\nit MUST be that EITHER God OR this must\nbe insane, but hardly both.\n\nSalvation is rebirth of the idea no-one CAN lose for ANYONE to gain.\nAnd everyone MUST gain, if anyone WOULD BE a gainer. Here is sanity restored.\nAnd on this single rock of truth can faith in God's eternal saneness rest, in\nperfect confidence and perfect peace. Reason is satisfied, for ALL insane beliefs\ncan be corrected here. And sin MUST be impossible, if THIS is true. This is the\nrock on which salvation rests; the vantage point from which the Holy Spirit gives\nmeaning and direction to the plan in which your special function has a part. For\nhere your special function is made whole, because it shares the FUNCTION of the\nwhole.\n\nRemember ALL temptation is but this; a mad belief that God's insanity\nwould make YOU sane, and GIVE you what you want. That either God OR you must LOSE\nto madness, because your aims can NOT be reconciled. Death demands life, but life\nis NOT maintained at ANY cost. No-one CAN suffer for the Will of God to be\nfulfilled. Salvation IS His Will BECAUSE you share it. NOT for you alone, but for\nthe Self which IS the Son of God. He CANNOT lose, for if he could, the loss would\nbe his Father's, and in Him NO loss is possible. And this is sane BECAUSE it is\nthe truth.",

    "content": "The Principle of Salvation\n\nThe Holy Spirit can use ALL that you give to Him for your salvation.\nBut He CANNOT use what you withhold. For He can NOT take it from you, WITHOUT\nyour willingness. For, if He did, you would believe He wrested it from you\nAGAINST your will. And so you would not learn it IS your will to be without it.\nYou need not give it to Him WHOLLY willingly, for if you could, you had no need\nfor Him. But this He needs; that you PREFER He take it, than that you keep it for\nyourself alone, and recognize that what brings loss to no-one YOU WOULD NOT KNOW.\nThis much is necessary to add to the idea no-one CAN lose for you to gain. And\nnothing more.\n\nHere is the ONLY principle salvation needs. Nor is it necessary that\nyour faith in it be strong, unswerving, and without attack from all beliefs\nopposed to it. You HAVE no fixed allegiance. But remember salvation is not needed\nby the saved. You are NOT called upon to do what one divided still against\nhimself WOULD find impossible. Have little faith that wisdom COULD be found in\nsuch a state of mind. But be you thankful that only little faith is ASKED of you.\nWhat BUT a little faith remains to those who still believe in sin? What COULD\nthey know of Heaven and the justice of the saved?\n\nThere is a kind of justice in salvation of which the world knows\nnothing. To the world, justice and VENGEANCE are the same, for sinners see\njustice ONLY as their punishment, perhaps sustained by someone ELSE, but NOT\nescaped. The laws of sin DEMAND a victim. WHO it may be makes little difference.\nBut death MUST be the cost and MUST be paid. This is NOT justice, but insanity.\nYet how could justice BE defined WITHOUT insanity, where love means hate, and\ndeath is seen as victory and triumph over eternity and timelessness and life?\n\nYou who know not of justice still can ask, and learn the answer.\nJustice looks on all in the same way. It is NOT just that one should lack for\nwhat another has. For that is vengeance, in WHATEVER form it takes. Justice\ndemands NO sacrifice, for ANY sacrifice is made that sin MAY BE PRESERVED and\nKEPT.\nIt is a payment offered for the cost of sin, BUT NOT THE TOTAL COST. The rest is\ntaken from another, to be laid beside your LITTLE payment, to “atone” for all\nthat you would keep and NOT give up. So is the victim seen as PARTLY you, with\nsomeone ELSE by far the greater part. And in the TOTAL cost, the greater his, the\nless is yours. And justice, being blind, is satisfied by being paid, it matters\nnot by whom.\n\nCan this BE justice? God knows not of this. But justice DOES He know,\nand knows it well. For He is wholly fair to everyone. Vengeance is alien to His\nMind BECAUSE He knows of justice. To be just is to be fair, AND NOT be vengeful.\nFairness AND vengeance are impossible, for each one contradicts the other, and\ndenies that it is real. It is impossible for you to SHARE the Holy Spirit's\njustice, with a mind that can conceive of specialness at all. Yet how could HE be\njust, if He condemns a sinner for the crimes he did not do, but THINKS he did?\nAnd where would justice be if He demanded of the ones obsessed with the idea of\npunishment that they lay it aside, unaided, and perceive it is not true?\n\nIt is extremely hard for those who still believe sin meaningful to\nunderstand the Holy Spirit's justice. They believe He shares their OWN confusion,\nand can NOT avoid the vengeance that their own belief in justice MUST entail. And\nso they fear the Holy Spirit, and perceive the wrath of God in Him. They are\nunjust indeed to Him. Nor can they trust Him NOT to strike them dead with\nlightening bolts torn from the fires of Heaven by God's Own angry hand. They DO\nbelieve that Heaven is hell, and ARE afraid of love. And deep suspicion and the\nchill of fear come over them when they are told that they have NEVER sinned.\nTheir world DEPENDS on sin's stability. And they perceive the “threat” of what\nGod KNOWS as justice to be more destructive to themselves and to their world than\nvengeance, which they understand and love.\n\nSo do they think the LOSS of sin a curse. And flee the blessing of the\nHoly Spirit as if He were a messenger from hell, sent from above in treachery and\nguile, to work God's vengeance on them in the guise of a deliverer and friend.\nWhat COULD He be to them except a devil dressed to deceive, within an angel's\ncloak? And what escape has He for them, except a door to hell that SEEMS to look\nlike Heaven's gate? Yet justice cannot punish those who ask for punishment, but\nhave a Judge Who knows that they are wholly innocent in truth. In justice He is\nBOUND to set them free, and GIVE them all the honor they deserve, and have denied\nthemselves because they are NOT fair, and CANNOT understand that they ARE\ninnocent.\n\nLove is NOT understandable to sinners. BECAUSE they think that justice\nis SPLIT OFF from love, and stands for something else. And thus is love perceived\nas weak and vengeance strong. For love has LOST when judgment left its side, and\nis too weak to SAVE from punishment. But vengeance WITHOUT love has GAINED in\nstrength by being separate and apart from love. And what BUT vengeance now can\nhelp and save, while love stands feebly by, with helpless hands, bereft of\njustice and vitality, and powerless to save? What can Love ask of you who think\nthat all of this is true? Could He, in justice AND in love believe in your\nconfusion you HAVE much to give?\n\nYou are NOT asked to trust Him far. No further than what you SEE He\noffers you, and what you recognize you COULD not give yourself. In God's Own\njustice does He recognize all you deserve, but understands as well that you can\nNOT accept it for yourself. It is His Special Function to hold out to you the\ngifts the innocent DESERVE. And every one that you accept brings joy to Him AS\nWELL as you. He knows that Heaven is richer made by each one you accept. And God\nrejoices as His Son receives what loving justice KNOWS to be his due. For love\nand justice are NOT different. BECAUSE they are the same, does mercy stand at\nGod's right Hand, and GIVE the Son of God\nthe power to forgive HIMSELF of sin.\n\nTo him who merits EVERYTHING, how can it be that ANYTHING is kept FROM\nhim? For that would be injustice, and unfair indeed to all the holiness that IS\nin him, however much he recognize it not. God knows of NO injustice. He would not\nallow His Son be judged by those who seek his death, and COULD not see his worth\nat all. What honest witnesses could THEY call forth, to speak on his behalf? And\nwho would come to plead FOR him, and not AGAINST his life? No justice would be\ngiven him by you. Yet God ensured that justice WOULD be done unto the Son He\nloves, and would protect from ALL unfairness you might seek to offer, believing\nvengeance IS his proper due.\nNovember , 1967\n\nAs specialness cares not who pays the cost of sin, so it BE paid, the\nHoly Spirit heeds not who looks on innocence at last, provided it IS seen and\nrecognized. For just ONE witness is enough, if he sees truly. Simple justice asks\nno more. Of each one does the Holy Spirit ask if he will be that one, so justice\nmay return to love, and there be satisfied. Each special function He allots is\nbut for this; that each one learn that love and justice are NOT separate. And\nboth are strengthened by their union with each other. Without love is justice\nprejudiced and weak. And love WITHOUT justice is impossible. For love is fair,\nand cannot chasten without cause. What cause can BE to warrant an attack upon the\ninnocent? In justice, then, does love correct mistakes, but NOT in vengeance. For\nthat would be unjust to innocence.\n\nYou can be perfect witness to the power of love AND justice, if you\nunderstand it is impossible the Son of God COULD merit vengeance. You need NOT\nperceive, in every circumstance, that this is true. Nor need you look to your\nexperience WITHIN the world, which is but shadows of all that is REALLY happening\nwithin yourself. The understanding that you need comes NOT of you, but from a\nlarger Self, so great and holy that He COULD not doubt His innocence. Your\nspecial function is a call to Him, that He may smile on you whose sinlessness He\nshares. HIS understanding will be YOURS. And so the Holy Spirit's Special\nFunction has been fulfilled. God's Son has found a witness unto his sinlessness,\nand NOT his sin. How LITTLE need you give the Holy Spirit, that simple justice\nmay be given YOU.\n\nWithout impartiality there IS no justice. How CAN specialness be just?\nJudge not because you cannot, NOT because you are a miserable sinner too.\nHow can the special REALLY understand that justice is the same for everyone? To\ntake from one to give another MUST be an injustice to them both, since they are\nequal in the Holy Spirit's sight. Their Father gave the SAME inheritance to both.\nWho would have more OR less is not aware that he has everything. He is no judge\nof what MUST be another's due, because he thinks HE is deprived. And so MUST he\nbe envious, and try to TAKE AWAY from whom he judges. He is NOT impartial, and\nCANNOT fairly see another's rights BECAUSE his own have been obscured to him.\n\nYou have the right to all the universe; to perfect peace, complete\ndeliverance from ALL effects of sin, and to the life eternal, joyous, and\ncomplete in EVERY way, as God appointed for His holy Son. This is the ONLY\njustice Heaven knows, and all the Holy Spirit brings to earth. Your special\nfunction shows you nothing else BUT perfect justice CAN prevail for you. And you\nARE safe from vengeance in ALL forms. The world deceives, but it can NOT replace\nGod's justice with a version of its own. For only love IS just, and CAN perceive\nwhat justice must accord the Son of God. Let love decide, and never fear that\nyou, in your unfairness, will deprive yourself of what GOD'S justice has allotted\nyou.",

    "content": "The Justice of Heaven\n\nWhat can it be but arrogance to think your little errors CANNOT be\nundone by Heaven's justice? And what COULD this mean, except that they are sins,\nand NOT mistakes, forever uncorrectable, and to be met with vengeance, NOT with\njustice? ARE you willing to be released from ALL effects of sin? You CANNOT\nanswer this until you see all that the answer MUST entail. For if you answer\n“yes,” this means you will forego ALL values of this world, in favor of the peace\nof Heaven. Not one sin would you retain. AND NOT ONE DOUBT THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE\nwill you hold dear, that sin be kept in place. You mean that truth has greater\nvalue now than ALL illusions. And you recognize that truth must be REVEALED to\nyou, because YOU know not what it IS.\n\nTo give reluctantly is not to gain the gift. BECAUSE YOU ARE RELUCTANT\nTO ACCEPT IT. It IS saved for you, until reluctance to receive it disappears, and\nyou are WILLING it be given you. God's justice warrants gratitude, NOT fear.\nNothing you give is lost to you or anyone, but cherished and preserved for you in\nHeaven, where all the treasures given to God's Son are kept for him, and offered\nanyone who but holds out his hand in willingness they be received. Nor is the\ntreasure LESS as it is given out. Each gift received but ADDS to the supply. For\nGod IS fair. He does not fight AGAINST His Son's reluctance to perceive salvation\nas a gift from Him. Yet would His justice not be satisfied until it is received\nby everyone.\n\nBe certain any answer to a problem the Holy Spirit solves will ALWAYS\nbe one in which NO-ONE loses. And this MUST be true BECAUSE He asks no sacrifice\nof anyone. An answer which demands the slightest loss to ANYONE has not RESOLVED\nthe problem, but has added TO it, and made it greater, HARDER to resolve, AND\nMORE UNFAIR. It is impossible the Holy Spirit could SEE unfairness as a\nresolution. To Him, what is unfair must be corrected BECAUSE it is unfair. And\nEVERY error is a perception in which one, at least, is seen unfairly. Thus is\njustice NOT accorded to the Son of God. When ANYONE\nis seen as losing, HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED. And punishment becomes his due, INSTEAD\nof justice.\n\nThe sight of innocence makes punishment impossible, and justice sure.\nThe Holy Spirit's perception leaves no GROUNDS for an attack. Only a LOSS could\njustify attack, and loss of ANY kind He cannot see. The world solves problems in\nanother way. IT sees a resolution as a state in which it is DECIDED who shall win\nand who shall lose; HOW MUCH the one shall take, and HOW MUCH can the loser still\ndefend. Yet does the problem still remain unsolved, for ONLY justice can set up a\nstate in which there IS no loser; no-one left unfairly treated and deprived, and\nthus with grounds for vengeance. Problem SOLVING can NOT be vengeance, which at\nbest can bring another problem ADDED to the first, in which the murder is not\nobvious.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's problem solving is the way in which the problem\nENDS. It has been solved BECAUSE it has been met with justice. And UNTIL it has,\nit will recur because it has NOT yet been solved. The principle that justice\nMEANS no-one can lose is crucial to this course. For miracles DEPEND on justice.\nNOT as it is seen through this world's eyes, but as God knows it, and as\nknowledge is reflected in sight the Holy Spirit gives. NO-ONE deserves to lose.\nAnd what would be UNJUST to him can NOT occur. Healing must be for everyone\nBECAUSE he does not merit an attack of any kind. What order CAN there be in\nmiracles, unless someone deserves to suffer MORE, and others LESS? And is this\njustice to the wholly innocent?\n\nA miracle IS justice. It is NOT a special gift to some, to be WITHHELD\nfrom others as LESS worthy, MORE condemned, and thus APART from healing. Who is\nthere who can be separate from salvation, if its PURPOSE is the end of\nspecialness? Where is salvation's justice if SOME errors are unforgivable, and\nWARRANT vengeance IN PLACE of healing and return of peace? Salvation cannot SEEK\nto help God's Son be MORE unfair than HE has sought to be.\nIf miracles, the Holy Spirit's gift, were given specially to an elect and special\ngroup, and kept APART from others as LESS deserving, then is He ALLY to\nspecialness. What He cannot perceive He bears no witness to. And everyone is\nEQUALLY entitled to His gift of healing and deliverance and peace.\n\nTo give a problem to the Holy Spirit to solve FOR you means that you\nWANT it solved. To keep it for yourself to solve WITHOUT His help is to decide it\nshould remain UNsettled, UNresolved, and lasting in its power of injustice and\nattack. No-one can BE unjust to you, unless you have decided first to BE unjust.\nAnd then MUST problems rise to block your way, and peace be scattered by the\nwinds of hate. Unless you think that ALL your brothers have an equal right to\nmiracles with you, you will not claim YOUR right to them, because you were unjust\nto one with EQUAL rights. Seek to deny, and you WILL feel denied. Seek to\ndeprive, and you HAVE BEEN deprived.\n\nA miracle can NEVER be received because another could receive it NOT.\nOnly forgiveness OFFERS miracles. And pardon MUST be just to everyone. The little\nproblems that you keep and hide become your secret sins BECAUSE you did not\nchoose to let them be removed FOR you. And so they gather dust and grow, until\nthey cover EVERYTHING that you perceive, and leave you fair to no-one. Not ONE\nright do YOU believe you have. And bitterness, with vengeance justified and mercy\nlost, condemns you as UNWORTHY of forgiveness. The unforgiven HAVE no mercy to\nbestow upon another. That is why your sole responsibility MUST be to take\nforgiveness for yourself.\n\nThe miracle that you receive you GIVE. Each one becomes an\nillustration of the law on which salvation rests; that justice MUST be done to\nall, if ANYONE is to be healed. No-one can lose, and everyone MUST benefit. Each\nmiracle is an example of what justice can accomplish, when it is offered to\neveryone alike. It is received and GIVEN equally. It IS awareness that giving and\nreceiving ARE the same.

And sight of bodies becomes the sign that sacrifice IS limited, and\nsomething still remains for you alone. And FOR this little to belong to you, are\nlimits placed on EVERYTHING outside, just as they are on everything you think is\nYOURS. For giving and receiving ARE the same. And to ACCEPT the limits of a body\nis to IMPOSE these limits on each brother whom you see. For you MUST see him as\nyou see yourself. The body IS a loss, and CAN be made to sacrifice. And while you\nsee your brother as a body,\nAPART from you and separate in his cell, you are demanding sacrifice of him AND\nyou.\n\nWhat greater sacrifice could be demanded than that God's Son perceive\nhimself without his Father? And his Father be without His Son? Yet EVERY\nsacrifice demands that they be separate and without the other. The memory of God\nMUST be denied, if ANY sacrifice is asked of ANYONE. What witness to the\nwholeness of God's Son is seen within a world of separate bodies, however much he\nwitnesses to truth? He is INVISIBLE in such a world. Nor can his song of union\nand of joy be heard at all. Yet is it given him to make the world recede before\nhis song and sight of him REPLACE the body's eyes.\n\nThose who would see the witnesses to truth INSTEAD of to illusion\nmerely ask that they might see a PURPOSE in the world that gives it sense and\nmakes it meaningful. WITHOUT your special function HAS this world no meaning for\nyou. Yet it can become a treasure house as rich and limitless as Heaven Itself.\nNo instant passes here in which your brother's holiness can NOT be seen, to add a\nlimitless supply to every meager scrap and tiny crumb of happiness that you allot\nyourself. You CAN lose sight of oneness, but can NOT make sacrifice of its\nreality. Nor can you LOSE what you would sacrifice, nor keep the Holy Spirit from\nHis task of showing you that it has NOT been lost.\n\nHear, then, the song your brother sings to you. And LET the world\nrecede, and TAKE the rest his witness offers on behalf of peace. But judge him\nnot, for you will hear no song of liberation for yourself, nor see what it is\ngiven him to witness to, that YOU may see it and rejoice WITH him. Make not his\nholiness a sacrifice to your belief in sin. You sacrifice YOUR innocence with\nhis, and die each time you see in him a sin deserving death. Yet every instant\ncan you be reborn, and given life again. His holiness gives life to you, who\nCANNOT die because his sinlessness is known to God, and\ncan no more be sacrificed by you than can the light in you be blotted out because\nhe sees it not.\n\nYou who would make a sacrifice of life, and make your eyes and ears\nbear witness to the death of God and of His holy Son, think not that you have\npower to make of them what God willed not they be. In Heaven God's Son is NOT\nimprisoned in a body, nor is sacrificed in solitude to sin. And as he is in\nHeaven, so MUST he be eternally and everywhere. He is the same forever. Born\nagain each instant, untouched by time, and FAR beyond the reach of ANY sacrifice\nof life OR death. For neither did he make, and only ONE was given him, by One Who\nKNOWS His gifts can NEVER suffer sacrifice and loss.\n\nGod's justice rests in gentleness upon His Son, and keeps him safe\nfrom ALL injustices the world would lay upon him. COULD it be that YOU could make\nhis sins reality, and sacrifice his Father's Will for him? Condemn him not by\nseeing him within the rotting prison where he sees himself. It is your special\nfunction to ensure the door be opened, that he may come forth to shine on you,\nand give you back the gift of freedom by receiving it of you. What is the Holy\nSpirit's Special Function but to release the holy Son of God from the\nimprisonment he made, to KEEP himself from justice? Could YOUR function be a task\napart and SEPARATE from His Own?",

    "content": "The Forms of Error\n\nIt is NOT difficult to understand the reasons why you do not ask the\nHoly Spirit to solve ALL problems for you. HE has not a greater difficulty in\nresolving some than others. Every problem is the SAME to Him, because each one is\nsolved in just the SAME respect, and through the SAME approach. The aspects that\nNEED solving do not change, whatever FORM the problem seems to take. A problem\ncan appear in MANY forms, and it will do so while the problem lasts. It serves no\npurpose to attempt to solve it in a SPECIAL form. It WILL recur, and then recur\nagain and yet again, until it has been answered for ALL time, and will not rise\nagain in ANY form. And ONLY then are you RELEASED from it.\n\nThe Holy Spirit offers you release from EVERY problem that you think\nyou have. They are the SAME to Him, because each one, regardless of the form it\nseems to take, is a demand that someone suffer loss, and make a sacrifice that\nyou might gain. And, when the situation is worked out so NO-ONE loses, is the\nproblem gone, because it was an error in perception, which now has been\ncorrected. One mistake is NOT more difficult for Him to bring to truth than is\nanother. For there IS but one mistake; the whole idea that loss is possible, and\nCOULD result in gain for anyone. If THIS were true, then God WOULD be unfair; sin\nWOULD be possible, attack be justified, and vengeance fair. This ONE mistake, in\nANY form, has ONE correction. There IS no loss; to think there IS, is a mistake.\n\nYou HAVE no problems, though you THINK you have. And yet you COULD not\nthink so, if you saw them vanish one by one, WITHOUT regard to size, complexity,\nor place and time, or ANY attribute which you perceive that makes each one seem\ndifferent from the rest. Think not the limits YOU impose on what you see can\nlimit God in ANY way. The miracle of justice can correct ALL errors. Every\nproblem IS an error. It does injustice to the Son of God,\nand therefore is not true. The Holy Spirit does not evaluate injustices as great\nor small, or more or less. They have NO properties to Him. They are mistakes from\nwhich the Son of God IS suffering, but needlessly. And so He takes the thorns and\nnails away. He does not pause to judge whether the hurt be large or little. He\nmakes but one judgment; that to hurt God's Son MUST be unfair, and therefore is\nnot so.\n\nYou who believe it safe to give but SOME mistakes to be corrected\nwhile you keep the others to yourself, remember this: Justice is total. There IS\nno such thing as partial justice. If the Son of God is guilty, then is he\ncondemned, and he DESERVES no mercy from the God of justice. But ask not God to\npunish him because YOU find him guilty, and would have him die. God OFFERS you\nthe means to see his innocence. Would it be fair to punish him because you will\nnot LOOK at what is there to see? Each time you keep a problem for YOURSELF to\nsolve, or judge that it is one which HAS no resolution, you have made it great,\nand past the hope of healing. You deny the miracle of justice CAN be fair.\n\nIf God is just, then CAN there be NO problems that justice cannot\nsolve. But YOU believe that some injustices ARE fair and good, and necessary to\npreserve yourself. It is THESE problems that you think are great, and cannot BE\nresolved. For there are those you WANT to suffer loss, and NO-ONE whom you wish\nto be preserved from sacrifice entirely. Consider once again your special\nfunction. ONE is given you to see in him his perfect sinlessness. And you will\nASK no sacrifice of him, because you could not will he suffer loss. The miracle\nof justice you call forth will rest on you as surely as on him. Nor will the Holy\nSpirit be content until it is received by everyone. For what you give to Him IS\neveryone's, and BY your giving it can He ensure that everyone receives it\nequally.\n\nThink, then, how great your OWN release will be, when you are willing\nto receive correction for ALL your problems. You will not keep ONE, for pain in\nANY form you will not WANT. And you will see each little hurt resolved before the\nHoly Spirit's gentle sight. For all of them ARE little in His sight and worth no\nmore than just a tiny sigh before they disappear, to be forever undone and\nunremembered. What seemed once to be a SPECIAL problem, a mistake WITHOUT a\nremedy, or an affliction WITHOUT a cure, has been transformed into a universal\nblessing. Sacrifice is gone. And in its place, the Love of God can be remembered,\nand will shine away all memory of sacrifice and loss.\n\nHe cannot BE remembered until justice is loved INSTEAD of feared. He\ncannot be unjust to anyone or anything, because He knows that EVERYTHING that is\nbelongs to Him, and will forever be as He created it. Nothing He loves but MUST\nbe sinless and beyond attack. Your special function opens wide the door beyond\nwhich is the memory of His Love kept perfectly intact and undefiled. And all you\nneed to do is but to wish that Heaven be given you instead of hell, and every",

    "content": "The Borderland\n\nComplexity is not of God. How COULD it be, when all He knows is One?\nHe knows of ONE creation, ONE reality, ONE truth, and but ONE Son. Nothing\nCONFLICTS with Oneness. How, then, COULD there be complexity in Him? What IS\nthere to decide? For it is CONFLICT that makes choice complex. The truth is\nsimple; it is one, WITHOUT an opposite. And how could strife enter in its simple\nPresence, and bring complexity where Oneness is? The truth makes NO decisions,\nfor there is nothing to decide BETWEEN. And ONLY if there were could choosing be\na necessary step in the advance toward Oneness. What is everything leaves room\nfor NOTHING ELSE.\n\nYet is this magnitude beyond the scope of this curriculum. Nor is it\nnecessary we dwell on anything that cannot be immediately grasped. There is a\nborderland of thought that stands between this world and Heaven. It is not a\nplace, and WHEN you reach it is APART from time. Here is the meeting place where\nthoughts are brought TOGETHER; where conflicting values MEET, and ALL illusions\nare laid down beside the truth, where they are judged to be untrue. This\nborderland is just beyond the gate of Heaven. Here is every thought made pure and\nwholly simple. Here is sin denied, and everything that IS received instead.\n\nThis is the journey's end. We have referred to it as the “real world.”\nAnd yet there is a contradiction here, in that the words imply a LIMITED reality,\na PARTIAL truth, a SEGMENT of the universe made true. This is because knowledge\nmakes NO attack upon perception. They are brought together, and only ONE\ncontinues past the gate where Oneness is. Salvation IS a borderland, where place\nand time and choice have meaning still, and yet it can be seen that they are\ntemporary, OUT of place, and EVERY choice has been ALREADY made.\n\nNothing the Son of God believes can be destroyed. But what is truth to\nhim must be brought to the last comparison that he will ever make; the last\nevaluation that will be possible, the final judgment upon this world. It is the\njudgment of the truth upon illusion, of knowledge on perception; IT HAS NO\nMEANING AND DOES NOT EXIST. This is NOT your decision. It is but a simple\nstatement of a simple fact. But in this world there ARE no simple facts, because\nwhat is the same and what is different remain unclear. The one ESSENTIAL thing to\nmake a choice at all is this distinction. And herein lies the difference between\nthe worlds. In this one, choice IS made impossible. In the real world, is\nchoosing simplified.\n\nSalvation stops just short of Heaven, for only perception NEEDS\nsalvation. Heaven was never lost, and so can not be saved. Yet who can make a\nchoice BETWEEN the wish for Heaven and the wish for hell, unless he recognizes\nthey are NOT the same? This difference is the learning goal this course has set.\nIt will not go beyond this aim. Its ONLY purpose is to teach what is the same and\nwhat is different, leaving room to make the only choice that CAN be made. There\nis no basis FOR choice in this complex and over-complicated world. For no-one\nunderstands what is the same, and seems to choose where no choice really is. The\nreal world is the area of choice made real, NOT in the outcome, but in the\nperception of alternatives FOR choice.\n\nThat there IS choice is an illusion. Yet, within this ONE lies the\nundoing of every illusion, NOT excepting this. Is not this like your special\nfunction, where the separation is undone by change of PURPOSE in what once was\nspecialness, and now IS union? ALL illusions are but one. And, in the recognition\nthis is so, lies the ability to give up ALL attempts to choose BETWEEN them, and\nmake them different. How simple is the choice between two things so clearly\nUNalike. There IS no conflict here. No sacrifice",

    "content": "Where Sin Has Left\n\nForgiveness is this world's equivalent of Heaven's justice. It\ntranslates the world of sin into a simple world, where justice can be reflected\nfrom BEYOND the gate behind which total lack of limits lies. Nothing in boundless\nlove could NEED forgiveness. And what is charity WITHIN the world gives way to\nsimple justice past the gate that opens into Heaven. No-one forgives unless he\nhas believed in sin, and STILL believes that he has much to be forgiven.\nForgiveness thus becomes the means by which he learns HE has done nothing to\nforgive. Forgiveness always rests upon the one who offers it, until he sees\nHIMSELF as needing it no more. And thus is he returned to his REAL function of\ncreating, which his forgiveness offers him again.\n\nForgiveness turns the world of sin into a world of glory, wonderful to\nsee. Each flower shines in light, and every bird sings of the joy of Heaven.\nThere is no sadness and there is no parting here, for everything is TOTALLY\nforgiven. And what has been forgiven MUST join, for nothing stands BETWEEN, to\nkeep them separate and apart. The sinless MUST perceive that they are one, for\nnothing stands between, to push the other off, and in the space which sin left\nvacant do they JOIN as one, in gladness recognizing what is part of them has NOT\nbeen kept apart and separate. The holy place on which you stand is but the space\nthat sin has left. And here you see the Face of Christ arising in its place.\n\nWho could behold the Face of Christ, and NOT recall His Father as He\nreally is? Who could fear love, and stand upon the ground where sin has left a\nplace for Heaven's altar to rise and tower far above the world, and reach beyond\nthe universe to touch the heart of ALL creation? What IS Heaven, but a song of\ngratitude and love and praise, by everything created, to the Source of its\ncreation? The holiest of altars is set where once was sin believed to be. For\nhere does every light of heaven come, to be rekindled and increased in joy. For\nhere is what was lost to them restored, and all their radiance made whole again.\n\nForgiveness brings no little miracles to lay before the gate of\nHeaven. Here the Son of God Himself comes to receive each gift that brings him\nnearer to his home. Not one is lost, and none is cherished more than any other.\nEach reminds him of His Father's Love as surely as the rest. And each one teaches\nhim that what he fears he loves the most. What BUT a miracle could change his\nmind, so that he understands that love cannot BE feared? What other miracle is\nthere but this? And what else NEED there be, to make the space between you\ndisappear? Where sin once was perceived will rise a world which will become an\naltar to the truth. And YOU will join the lights of Heaven there, and sing their\nsong of gratitude and praise.\n\nFor as they come to YOU to be complete, so will you go with them. For\nno-one hears the song of Heaven, and remains without a voice that adds its power\nto the song, and makes it sweeter still. And each one joins the singing at the\naltar which was raised within the tiny spot that sin proclaimed to be its own.\nAnd what WAS tiny then has soared into a magnitude of song, in which the universe\nhas joined with but a single voice. This tiny spot of sin that stands between you\nstill is holding back the happy opening of Heaven's gate. How LITTLE is the\nhindrance which withholds the wealth of Heaven from you. And how GREAT will be\nthe joy in Heaven when you join the mighty chorus to the Love of God.",

    "content": "The Little Hindrance\n\nA little hindrance can seem large indeed to those who do not\nunderstand that miracles are all the same. But teaching that is what this course\nis FOR. That is its only purpose, for only that is all there is to learn. And you\ncan learn it many different ways. All learning is a help or hindrance to the gate\nof Heaven. Nothing in between is possible. There are TWO teachers only, who point\nin different ways. And you will go along the way your chosen teacher leads. There\nare but TWO directions you can take, while time remains and choice is meaningful.\nFor never will another road be made, except the way to Heaven. You but choose\nwhether to go TOWARDS Heaven, or away to nowhere. There is nothing else to\nchoose.\n\nNothing is ever lost but time, which, in the end, IS nothing. It is\nbut a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real Teacher of the\nworld. But since you DO believe in its reality, why should you waste it going\nnowhere, when it CAN be used to reach a goal as high as learning can achieve?\nThink not the way to Heaven's gate is difficult at all. Nothing you undertake\nwith certain purpose and high resolve and happy confidence, holding each other's\nhand and keeping step to Heaven's song, is difficult to do. But it IS hard indeed\nto wander off, alone and miserable, down a road which leads to nothing, and which\nHAS no purpose.\n\nGod gave His Teacher to REPLACE the one you made, NOT to CONFLICT with\nit. And what He would replace HAS BEEN replaced. Time lasted but an instant in\nyour mind, with NO effect upon eternity. And so is ALL time past, and everything\nEXACTLY as it was before the way to nothingness was made. The tiny tick of time,\nin which\nthe first mistake was made, and ALL of them within that ONE mistake, held also\nthe Correction for that one, and ALL of them that came within the first. And in\nthat tiny instant time was gone, for that was all it ever was. What God gave\nAnswer to IS answered, and IS gone.\n\nTo you who still believe you live in time, and know not it is gone,\nthe Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely small and senseless maze\nyou still perceive in time, though it has long since gone. You think you live in\nwhat is past. Each thing you look upon you saw but for an instant, long ago,\nbefore its unreality gave way to truth. Not one illusion still remains unanswered\nin your mind. Uncertainty was brought to Certainty so long ago that it is hard\nindeed to hold it to your heart, as if it were before you still. The tiny instant\nyou would keep, and make eternal, passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to\nnotice it had come.\n\nWhat disappeared too quickly to affect the simple knowledge of the Son\nof God, can hardly still be there for you to choose to be your teacher. Only in\nthe past, – an ancient past, too short to make a world in answer to creation, –\ndid this world APPEAR to rise. So VERY long ago, for such a tiny interval of time\nthat not one note in Heaven's song was missed. Yet, in each unforgiving act or\nthought, in every judgment, and in all belief in sin is that one instant still\ncalled back, as if it could be made again in time. You keep an ancient memory\nbefore your eyes. And he who lives in memories alone is unaware of where he IS.\n[missing pages -739]311\n\nForgiveness is the great release from time. It is the key to learning\nthat the past is over. Madness speaks no more. There IS no OTHER teacher and no\nOTHER way. For what has been undone no longer is. And who can stand upon a\ndistant shore, and dream himself across an ocean, to a place and time that have\nlong since gone by? How REAL a hindrance can this dream be to where he really IS?\nFor this is fact, and does NOT change whatever dreams he has. Yet can he still\nIMAGINE he is elsewhere, and in another time. In the extreme, he can delude\nhimself that this is true, and pass from mere imagining into belief and into\nmadness, quite convinced that where he would prefer to be, he IS.\n\nIs this a HINDRANCE to the place whereon he stands? Is any echo from\nthe past that he may hear a fact in what is there to hear where he is now? And\nhow much can his own delusions about time and place affect a change in where he\nREALLY is? The unforgiven is a voice that calls from out a past forever more gone\nby. And everything which points to it as real is but a wish that what is gone\ncould be made real again, and seen as here and now, in place of what is REALLY\nnow and here. Is this a HINDRANCE to the truth the past has gone, and CANNOT be\nreturned to you? And do you WANT that fearful instant kept, when Heaven seemed to\ndisappear, and God was feared and made a symbol of your hate?\n\nForget the time of terror that has been so long ago corrected and\nundone. Can sin withstand the Will of God? Can it be up to you to see the past,\nand put it in the present? You can NOT go back. And everything that points the\nway in the direction of the past but sets you on a mission whose accomplishment\ncan ONLY be unreal.\nSuch is the justice your ever loving Father has ensured MUST come to you. And\nfrom your own unfairness unto yourself has He protected you. You CANNOT lose your\nway, because there is no Way but His, and nowhere CAN you go, except to Him.\nWould He allow His Son to lose his way along a road long since a distant memory\nof a time gone by?\n\nThis course will teach you ONLY what is now. A dreadful instant in a\ndistant past, now perfectly corrected, is of no concern or value. Let the dead\nand gone be peacefully forgotten. Resurrection has come to take its place. And\nnow you are a part of Resurrection, NOT of death. No past illusions have the\npower to keep you in a place of death, a vault God's Son entered an instant, to\nbe instantly restored unto His Father's Perfect Love. And how can he be kept in\nchains long since removed, and gone forever from his mind? The Son that God\ncreated is as free as God created him. He was reborn the instant that he chose to\ndie, instead of live. And will you not forgive him now, because he made an error\nin the past that God remembers not, and is not there?\n\nNow are you shifting back and forth, between the past and present.\nSometimes the past seems real, as if it WERE the present. Voices FROM the past\nare heard, and then are doubted. You are like to one who still hallucinates, but\nlacks conviction in what he perceives. This is the borderland between the worlds,\nthe bridge between the past and present. Here the shadow of the past remains, but\nstill a present Light is dimly recognized. Once it is seen, this Light can never\nbe forgotten. It MUST draw you from the past into the present, where you really\nARE. The shadow voices do not CHANGE the laws of time or of eternity. They come\nfrom what is past and gone, but hinder not the true existence of the here and\nnow.\n\nThe real world is the second part of the hallucination time and death\nare real, and have existence which can be perceived. This terrible illusion was\ndenied in but the time it took for God to give His Answer to illusion for ALL\ntime and EVERY circumstance. And then it was no more, to be experienced as there.\nEach day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds,\nyou but relive the single instant when the time of terror was replaced by Love.\nAnd so you die each day to live again, until you cross the gap between the past\nand present, which is NOT a gap at all.\n\nSuch is each life; a seeming interval from birth to death, and on to\nlife again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago, which CANNOT be relived.\nAnd ALL of time is but the mad belief that what is over is still here and now.\nForgive the past and let it go, for it IS gone. You stand no longer on the ground\nthat lies between the worlds. You HAVE gone on, and reached the world that lies\nat Heaven's gate. There IS no hindrance to the Will of God, nor any need that you\nrepeat again a journey that was over long ago. Look gently on each other, and\nbehold the world in which perception of your hate has been transformed into a\nworld of Love.",

And through its perceived reality has entered\nall the world of sick illusions. All belief in sin, in power of attack, in hurt\nand harm, in sacrifice and death, has come to you.

    "content": "Review of Principles\n\nThis is a course in miracles. And, as such, the laws of healing must\nbe understood before the purpose of the course can be accomplished. Let us review\nthe principles that we have covered, and arrange them in a way that summarizes\nall that must occur for healing to be possible. For when it once is possible, it\nMUST occur. ALL sickness comes from separation. When the separation is denied, it\ngoes. For it IS gone as soon as the idea which brought it has been healed and\nbeen replaced by sanity. Sickness and sin are seen as consequence and cause, in a\nrelationship kept hidden from awareness, that it may be carefully preserved from\nreason's light.\n\nGuilt ASKS FOR punishment, and its request is granted. NOT in truth,\nbut in the world of shadows and illusions BUILT on sin. The Son of God perceives\nwhat he would see, because perception IS a wish fulfilled. Perception changes,\nMADE to take the place of changeless knowledge. Yet is truth unchanged. It cannot\nBE perceived, but only known. What is perceived takes many forms, but NONE has\nmeaning. Brought to truth, its senselessness is quite apparent. Kept APART from\ntruth, it SEEMS to have a meaning and be real. Perception's laws are OPPOSITE to\ntruth, and what IS true of knowledge is NOT true of ANYTHING that is apart from\nit. Yet has God given Answer to the world of sickness, Which applies to ALL its\nforms.\n\nGod's Answer is eternal, though It operates in time, where It is\nneeded. But, because It IS of God, the laws of time do not affect Its workings.\nIt is in this world, but NOT a part of it. For It is real, and dwells where all\nreality MUST be. Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but SEEM to be\napart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected OUT, and seems to be\nEXTERNAL to the mind, is NOT outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has\nNOT left its source. God's Answer lies where the belief in sin MUST be, for only\nthere can its effects be utterly undone, and without cause.\n\nPerception's laws must be reversed, because they ARE reversals of the\nlaws of truth. The laws of truth FOREVER will be true, and cannot BE reversed;\nyet can be SEEN as upside down. And this must be corrected where the illusion of\nreversal lies. It is impossible that one illusion be LESS amenable to truth than\nare the rest. But it IS possible that some are given greater VALUE, and less\nwillingly OFFERED to truth for healing and for help. NO illusion has ANY truth in\nit. Yet it appears some are MORE true than others, although this clearly makes no\nsense at all. All that a hierarchy of illusions can show is PREFERENCE, NOT\nreality.\n\nWhat relevance has preference to the truth? Illusions are illusions,\nand are false. Your preference gives them NO reality. Not one is true in ANY way,\nand all must yield with equal ease to what God gave as Answer to them all. God's\nWill is One. And ANY wish that SEEMS to go AGAINST His Will has NO foundation in\nthe truth. Sin is not error, for it goes BEYOND correction to impossibility. Yet\nthe belief that it is real has made some errors seem forever PAST the hope of\nhealing, and the lasting grounds for hell. If this were so, would Heaven be\nopposed by its own opposite, as real as it.\n\nThen would God's Will be split in two, and all creation be subjected\nto the laws of two opposing powers, until God becomes impatient, splits the world\napart, and relegates attack unto Himself. Thus has He lost His Mind, proclaiming\nsin has taken His reality from Him, and brought His Love at last to vengeance'\nheels. For such an insane picture, an insane defense can be expected, but can NOT\nestablish that the picture must be true. Nothing GIVES meaning where no meaning\nIS. And truth needs NO defense to make it true. Illusions HAVE no witnesses, and\nno effects. Who looks on them is but deceived.\n\nForgiveness is the only function here, and serves to bring the joy\nthis world denies to every aspect of God's Son where sin was thought to rule.\nPerhaps you do not see the role forgiveness plays in ending death, and ALL\nbeliefs\nthat rise from mists of guilt. Sins are beliefs which you impose between your\nbrother and yourself. They limit you to time and place, and give a little space\nto you; ANOTHER little space to him. This separating off is symbolized, in your\nperception, by a body which is clearly separate and a thing apart. Yet what this\nsymbol REPRESENTS is but your wish to BE apart and separate.\n\nForgiveness TAKES AWAY what stands between your brother and yourself.\nIt is the wish that you be JOINED with him, and NOT alone. We call it “wish”\nbecause it still conceives of other choices, and has not yet reached beyond the\nworld of choice entirely. Yet is this wish in line with Heaven's state, and not\nin OPPOSITION to God's Will. Although it falls far short of giving you your full\ninheritance, it DOES remove the obstacles which YOU have placed between the\nHeaven where you are, and RECOGNITION of where and what you are. Facts are\nunchanged. But facts can be denied and thus unknown, though they were known\nBEFORE they were denied.\n\nSalvation, perfect and complete, asks but a LITTLE wish that what is\ntrue be true. A LITTLE willingness to overlook what is not there. A LITTLE sigh\nthat speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world which death and desolation\nseem to rule. In joyous answer will creation rise within you, to REPLACE the\nworld you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and complete. What is forgiveness, but\na willingness that truth be true? What can remain unhealed and broken from a\nUnity Which holds all things within Itself? There is NO sin. And EVERY miracle is\npossible the INSTANT that the Son of God perceives his wishes and the Will of God\nare One.\n\nWhat is the Will of God? He wills His Son have everything. And this He\nguaranteed when He created him AS everything. It is impossible that anything be\nlost, if what you HAVE is what you ARE. This is the miracle by which creation\nbecame YOUR function, sharing it with God. It is not understood APART from Him,\nand therefore has no meaning in this world. Here does the Son of God ask NOT too\nmuch, but FAR too little. He would sacrifice his own identity WITH everything, to\nfind a LITTLE treasure of his own. And this he cannot do, without a sense of\nisolation, loss, and loneliness. This IS the treasure he has sought to find. And\nhe COULD only be afraid of it.\n\nIs fear a treasure? Can uncertainty be what you WANT? Or is it a\nmistake about your will, and what you REALLY are? Let us consider what the error\nIS, so it can be corrected, NOT protected. Sin is belief attack can be projected\nOUTSIDE the mind where the belief arose. Here is the firm conviction that ideas\nCAN leave their source made real and meaningful. And FROM this error does the\nworld of sin and sacrifice arise. This world is an attempt to prove your\ninnocence, while cherishing attack. Its failure lies in that you STILL FEEL\nguilty, though without understanding WHY. Effects are SEPARATED from their\nsource. They SEEM to be BEYOND you to control or to prevent.\n\nWhat has been KEPT apart can never join. Cause and effect are one, NOT\nseparate. God wills you learn what always has been true. That he created you as\npart of Him, and this must still be true BECAUSE ideas leave not their source.\nSuch is creation's law; that each idea\nthe mind conceives but ADDS to its abundance, NEVER takes away. This is as true\nof what is idly wished as what is truly willed, because the mind can wish to be\ndeceived, but CANNOT make it be what it is not. And to believe ideas can leave\ntheir source is to invite illusions to be true, WITHOUT SUCCESS. Nor never will\nsuccess BE possible in trying to deceive the Son of God.\n\nThe miracle is possible when cause and consequence are brought\ntogether, NOT kept separate. The healing of effect WITHOUT the cause can merely\nshift effects to other forms. And this is NOT release. God's Son could never be\ncontent with LESS than full salvation, and ESCAPE from guilt. For otherwise he\nstill demands that he must make SOME sacrifice, and thus denies that EVERYTHING\nis his, unlimited by loss of any kind. A tiny sacrifice is just the same in its\nEFFECTS as is the WHOLE idea of sacrifice. If loss in ANY form is possible, then\nis God's Son made incomplete and not himself. Nor will he know himself, nor\nrecognize his will. He has foresworn his Father AND himself, and made them both\nhis enemy in hate.\n\nIllusions serve the purpose they were MADE to serve. And FROM their\npurpose, they derive whatever meaning that they seem to have. God gave to ALL\nillusions that were made ANOTHER purpose that would justify a miracle, WHATEVER\nform they took. In every miracle ALL healing lies, for God gave Answer to them\nall as one. And what is one to Him must BE the same. If you believe what is the\nsame is different, you but deceive yourself. What God calls one will be forever\none, NOT separate. His Kingdom IS united; thus it was created, and thus will it\never be. The miracle but calls your ancient name, which you WILL recognize\nbecause the truth is in your memory. And to this name your brother calls\nfor his release and yours. Heaven is shining on the Son of God. Deny him not,\nthat YOU may be released.\n\nEach instant is the Son of God reborn, until he chooses NOT to die\nagain. In every wish to hurt he chooses death, instead of what his Father wills\nfor him. Yet every instant offers life to him, because his Father wills that he\nshould live. In crucifixion is redemption laid, for healing is not needed where\nthere is no pain or suffering. Forgiveness is the ANSWER to attack of any kind.\nSo is attack DEPRIVED of its effects, and hate is answered in the Name of Love.\nTo you to whom it has been given to save the Son of God from crucifixion and from\nhell and death, all glory be forever. For you HAVE power to save the Son of God,\nbecause his Father willed that it be so. And in your hand does ALL salvation lie,\nto be both offered and received as one.\n\nTo use the power God has given you as He would have it used is\nnatural. It is NOT arrogant to be as He created you, or to make use of what He\ngave to answer ALL His Son's mistakes, and set him free. But it IS arrogant to\nLAY ASIDE the power that He gave, and choose a little, senseless wish instead of\nwhat He wills. The gift of God to you is limitless. There is NO circumstance it\ncannot answer, and NO problem which is not resolved within its gracious light.\nAbide in peace, where God would have you be. And be the means whereby your\nbrother finds the peace in which YOUR wishes are fulfilled. Let us unite in\nbringing blessing to the world of sin and death. For what can save each one of\nus, can save us all. There is no difference among the Sons of God.\n\nThe Unity that specialness denies will save them all, for what is One\ncan HAVE no specialness. And EVERYTHING belongs to each of them. No wishes lie\nbetween a brother and his own. To get from one is to deprive them all. And yet to\nbless but one gives blessing\nto them all as one. Your ancient name belongs to everyone, as theirs to you. Call\non your brother's name, and God will answer, for on Him you call. Could He refuse\nto answer, when He has ALREADY answered all who call on Him? A miracle can make\nno change at all. But it CAN make what always has been true be RECOGNIZED by\nthose who know it not. And by this little gift of truth but let to be itself; the\nSon of God allowed to be himself, and all creation freed to call upon the Name of\nGod as one.",

    "content": "The Immediacy of Salvation\n\nThe one remaining problem that you have is that you see an interval\nbetween the TIME when you forgive, and will receive the benefits of trust. This\nbut reflects the little you would keep between YOURSELVES, that you might be a\nLITTLE separate. For time and space are ONE illusion, which takes different\nforms. If it has been projected BEYOND your minds, you think of it as time. The\nnearer it is brought to where it IS, the more you think of it in terms of space.\nThere is a DISTANCE you would keep apart from one another. And this space you see\nas time, because you still believe you are EXTERNAL to each other. This makes\ntrust impossible. And you can NOT believe that trust would settle every problem\nNOW.\n\nThus do you think it SAFER to remain a LITTLE careful and a LITTLE\nwatchful of interests perceived as separate. From this perception, you can not\nconceive of gaining what forgiveness offers NOW. The interval you think lies in\nbetween the giving and receiving of the gift SEEMS to be one in which you\nsacrifice, and suffer loss. You see EVENTUAL salvation; not IMMEDIATE results.\nSalvation IS immediate. Unless you so perceive it, you WILL be afraid of it,\nbelieving that the risk of loss is great between the time its PURPOSE is made\nyours, and its EFFECTS will come to you. In this form is the error still obscured\nthat is the SOURCE of fear. Salvation WOULD wipe out the space you see between\nyou still, and let you INSTANTLY become as one. And it is HERE you fear the loss\nwould lie.\n\nDo not project this fear to time, for time is NOT the enemy that you\nperceive. Time is as neutral as the body is, except in terms of what you see it\nFOR. If you would keep a little SPACE between you still, you want a little TIME\nin which forgiveness is withheld a little while. This makes the interval BETWEEN\nthe time in which forgiveness is withheld and given seem dangerous, with terror\njustified. But SPACE between you is apparent NOW, and cannot BE perceived in\nfuture time. No more can it be OVERLOOKED, except within the present.\nFUTURE loss is not your fear. But PRESENT joining IS your dread.\n\nWho can feel desolation except NOW? A FUTURE cause as yet HAS no\neffects. And therefore MUST it be that, if you fear, there is a PRESENT cause.\nAnd it is THIS that needs correction, NOT a future state. The plans YOU make for\nsafety all are laid within the future, where you CANNOT plan. No purpose has been\nGIVEN it as yet, and what WILL happen has as yet no cause. Who can predict\neffects without a cause? And who could fear effects UNLESS he thought they had\nBEEN caused and judged disastrous NOW? Belief in sin arouses fear, and like its\ncause, is looking forward; looking back, but OVERLOOKING what is here and now.\n\nYet only here and now its cause must be, if its effects ALREADY have\nbeen judged as fearful. And, in overlooking THIS, is it protected and kept\nseparate from healing. For a miracle is NOW. It stands ALREADY there, in present\ngrace, within the only interval of time which sin and fear have overlooked, but\nwhich is all there IS to time. The working out of ALL correction takes no time at\nall. But the ACCEPTANCE of the working out can SEEM to take forever. The change\nof purpose the Holy Spirit brought to your relationship has IN it all effects\nthat you will see. They can be looked at NOW. Why wait 'til they unfold in time,\nand fear they may NOT come, although already THERE?\n\nYou have been told that everything brings good that comes from God.\nAnd yet it SEEMS as if this is not so. Good in disaster's form is difficult to\ncredit in advance. Nor is there really SENSE in this idea. Why SHOULD the good\nappear in evil's form? And is this not deception if it does? Its CAUSE is here,\nif it appears at all. Why are not its effects apparent, then? Why in the future?\nAnd you seek to be content with sighing, and with “reasoning,” you do not\nunderstand it now, but WILL some day. And THEN its meaning will be clear. This is\nNOT reason, for it is unjust, and clearly hints at punishment until the time of\nliberation is at hand.\n\nGiven a change of purpose for the good, there is NO reason for an\ninterval in which disaster strikes, to be perceived as good some day, but now in\nform of pain. This is a SACRIFICE of now, which COULD not be the cost the Holy\nSpirit asks for what he gave WITHOUT a cost at all. Yet this illusion has a cause\nwhich, though untrue, must be ALREADY in your mind. And THIS illusion is but one\neffect which it engenders, and one form in which its outcome is perceived. This\ninterval in time, when retribution is perceived to be the form in which the good\nappears, is but one aspect of the little space that lies between you, unforgiven\nstill.\n\nBe not content with future happiness. It has NO meaning, and is NOT\nyour just reward. For you have cause for freedom NOW. What profits freedom in a\nprisoner's form? Why SHOULD deliverance be disguised as death? Delay is\nsenseless, and the reason that would maintain effects of PRESENT cause must be\ndelayed until a FUTURE time is merely a denial of the fact that consequence and\ncause MUST come as one. Look not to time, but to the little space between you",

    "content": "For They Have Come\n\nThink but how holy you must be, from whom the Voice for God calls\nlovingly unto your brother, that you may awake in him the Voice that answers to\nYOUR call. And think how holy HE must be, when in him sleeps your OWN salvation,\nwith HIS freedom joined. However much you wish he be condemned, God is in him.\nAnd never will you know He is in YOU as well, while you attack His chosen home,\nand battle with His host. Regard him gently. Look with loving eyes on him who\ncarries Christ within him, that you may behold His glory, and rejoice that Heaven\nis NOT separate from you.\n\nIs it too much to ask a little trust for him who carries Christ to\nyou, that you may be forgiven ALL your sins, and left without a single one you\ncherish still. Forget not that a shadow held between your brother and yourself\nobscures the Face of Christ and memory of God. And would you trade Them for an\nancient hate? The ground whereon you stand is holy ground BECAUSE of Them Who,\nstanding there with you, have blessed it with THEIR innocence and peace. The\nblood of hatred fades, to let the grass grow green again, and let the flowers be\nall white and sparkling in the summer sun. What was a place of death has now\nbecome a living temple in a world of light.\n\nBecause of Them. It is Their Presence Which has lifted holiness again\nto take its ancient place upon an ancient throne. Because of Them have miracles\nsprung up as grass and flowers on the barren ground which hate had scorched and\nrendered desolate. What hate has wrought have They undone. And now you stand on\nground so holy Heaven leans to join with it, and make it like Itself. The shadow\nof an ancient hate has gone, and all the blight and withering have passed forever\nfrom the land where They have come.\n\nWhat is a hundred or a thousand years to Them, or tens of thousands?\nWhen They come, time's purpose is fulfilled. What never WAS passes to nothingness\nwhen They have come. What hatred claimed is given up to love, and freedom lights\nup every living thing and lifts it into Heaven, where the lights grow ever\nbrighter as each one comes home. The incomplete is made complete again. And\nHeaven's joy has been increased because what is its own has been restored to it.\nThe bloodied earth is cleansed, and the insane have shed their garments of\ninsanity, to join Them on the ground whereon you stand.\n\nHeaven is grateful for this gift of what has been withheld so long.\nFor They have come to gather in Their Own. What has been blocked is opened; what\nwas held APART from light is given up that light may shine on it, and leave no\nspace nor distance lingering between the light of Heaven and the world. The\nholiest of all the spots on earth is where an ancient hatred has become a present\nlove. And They come quickly to the living temple, where a home for Them has been\nset up. There is no place in Heaven holier. And They HAVE come to dwell within\nthe temple offered them, to be THEIR resting place as well as YOURS.\n\nWhat hatred has released to love becomes the brightest light in\nHeaven's radiance. And all the lights in Heaven brighter grow in gratitude for\nwhat has been restored. Around you angels hover lovingly, to keep away all\ndarkened thoughts of sin, and KEEP the light where it has entered in. Your\nfootprints lighten up the world, for where you walk forgiveness goes with you.\nNo-one on earth but offers thanks to one who has restored his home, and sheltered\nhim from bitter winter and the freezing cold. And shall the Lord of Heaven and\nHis Son give LESS in gratitude for so much MORE?\n\nNow is the temple of the living God rebuilt as host again to Him by\nWhom it was created. Where He dwells, His Son dwells with Him, NEVER separate.\nAnd They give thanks that They are welcome made at last. Where stood a cross\nstands now the risen Christ, and ancient scars are healed within His sight. An\nancient miracle has come to bless, and to REPLACE an ancient enmity that came to\nkill. In gentle gratitude do God the Father AND the Son return to what is Theirs,\nand will forever be. Now is the Holy Spirit's purpose done. For They have come!\nFor They have come at last!",

    "content": "The Remaining Task\n\nWhat, then, remains to be undone, for you to REALIZE Their Presence?\nOnly this; you have a DIFFERENTIAL view of WHEN attack is justified, and WHEN you\nthink it is unfair, and NOT to be allowed. When you perceive it AS unfair, you\nthink that a response of anger now is just. And thus you see what IS the same as\nDIFFERENT. Confusion is not limited. If it occurs at all, it WILL be total. And\nits presence, in WHATEVER form, will hide Their Presence. They are known with\nclarity, or not at all. Confused perception will block knowledge. It is NOT a\nquestion of the SIZE of the confusion, or HOW MUCH it interferes. Its simple\nPRESENCE shuts the door to Theirs, and keeps Them there unknown.\n\nWhat does it MEAN if you perceive attack in certain FORMS to be unfair\nto you? It means that there MUST be some forms in which YOU THINK IT FAIR. For\notherwise, how could some be evaluated as UNfair? Some, then, are GIVEN meaning,\nand perceived as sensible. And only SOME are seen as meaningLESS. And this DENIES\nthe fact that ALL are senseless; EQUALLY without a cause or consequence, and\nCANNOT have effects of ANY kind. Their Presence is obscured by ANY veil which\nstands between Their shining innocence and your awareness it is your own, and\nEQUALLY belongs to every living thing along with you. God limits not. And what is\nlimited can NOT be Heaven. So it MUST be hell.\n\nUnfairness and attack are ONE mistake, so firmly joined that where one\nis perceived, the other MUST be seen. You cannot BE unfairly treated. The belief\nyou ARE is but another form of the idea you are deprived by someone NOT yourself.\nPROJECTION of the cause of sacrifice is at the root of everything perceived to be\nunfair, and NOT your just deserts. Yet it is YOU who ask this of yourself, in\ndeep injustice to the Son of God. You HAVE no enemy except yourself, and you are\nenemy indeed to him, because you do not know him AS yourself. What COULD be more\nunjust than that he be deprived of what he IS, denied the right to be himself,\nand asked to sacrifice his Father's Love and yours, as NOT his due?\n\nBeware of the temptation to perceive yourself unfairly treated. In\nthis view, you seek to find an innocence which is NOT Theirs, but yours alone,\nand at the cost of someone ELSE'S guilt. Can innocence be purchased by the giving\nof YOUR guilt to someone else? And IS this innocence, which your attack on him\nattempts to get? Is it not retribution for your own attack upon the Son of God\nyou seek? Is it not SAFER to believe that you are innocent of this, and\nvictimized DESPITE your innocence? Whatever way the game of guilt is played,\nTHERE MUST BE LOSS. Someone must LOSE his innocence that someone ELSE can take it\nfrom him, making it his own.\n\nYou think your brother is unfair to you BECAUSE you think that one\nmust be unfair to MAKE the other innocent. And in this game do you perceive one\nPURPOSE of your whole relationship. And this you seek to ADD unto the purpose\nGIVEN it. The Holy Spirit's purpose is to let the Presence of your holy Guests be\nknown to you. And TO this purpose nothing CAN be added, for the world is\npurposeless except for this. To add or take away from this ONE goal is but to\ntake away ALL purpose from the world, and from yourself. And each unfairness that\nthe world appears to lay upon you, you have laid on it, by rendering it\npurposeless, without the function that the Holy Spirit sees. And simple justice\nhas been thus denied to every living thing upon the earth.\n\nWhat this injustice does to you who judge unfairly, and who see as you\nhave judged, you cannot calculate. The world grows dim and threatening, and not a\ntrace of all the happy sparkle that salvation brought can you perceive, to\nlighten up your way. And so you see YOURSELF deprived of light, abandoned to the\ndark, unfairly left without a purpose in a futile world. The world is fair\nbecause the Holy Spirit has brought injustice to the Light within, and there has\nALL unfairness been resolved, and been REPLACED with justice and with love.

    "content": "The Picture of the Crucifixion\n\nWhenever you consent to suffer pain, to be deprived, unfairly treated,\nor in need of ANYTHING, you but accuse your brother of attack upon God's Son. You\nhold a picture of your crucifixion before his eyes, that he may see his sins are\nwrit in Heaven in your blood and death, and go before him, closing off the gate,\nand damning him to hell. Yet this is writ in hell and NOT in Heaven, where you\nare BEYOND attack, and prove his INNOCENCE. The picture of yourself you offer him\nyou show YOURSELF, and give it all your faith. The Holy Spirit offers you, to\ngive to him, a picture of yourself in which there is\nNO pain and NO reproach at all. And what was martyred to his guilt becomes the\nperfect witness to his innocence.\n\nThe power of witness is beyond belief, because it brings conviction in\nits wake. The witness is believed BECAUSE he points beyond himself, to what he\nREPRESENTS. A sick and suffering you but represents your brother's guilt; the\nwitness which you send, lest he forget the injuries he gave, from which you swear\nhe never will escape. This sick and sorry picture YOU accept, if only it can\nserve to punish him. The sick are merciless to everyone, and in contagion do they\nseek to kill. Death seems an easy price, if they can say, “Behold me, brother, at\nyour hand I die.” For sickness is the witness to his guilt, and death would prove\nhis errors MUST be sins.\n\nSickness is but a “little” death; a form of vengeance not yet total.\nYet it speaks with certainty for what it represents. The bleak and bitter picture\nyou have sent your brother, YOU have looked upon in grief. And everything that it\nhas shown to him have you believed, BECAUSE it witnessed to the guilt in him,\nwhich you perceived and loved. Now in the hands made gentle by His touch, the\nHoly Spirit lays a picture of a DIFFERENT you. It is a picture of a body still,\nfor what you REALLY are can not be seen nor pictured. But THIS one has NOT been\nused for purpose of attack, and therefore never suffered pain at all. IT\nwitnesses to the eternal truth that you can not BE hurt, and points BEYOND itself\nto both YOUR innocence and HIS.\n\nShow THIS unto your brother, who will see that every scar is healed,\nand every tear is wiped away in laughter and in love. And he will look on his\nforgiveness there, and with healed eyes will look BEYOND it, to the innocence\nthat he beholds in you. Here is the proof that he has NEVER sinned; that NOTHING\nthat his madness bid him do was ever done, or ever had effects of any kind. That\nNO reproach he laid upon his heart was EVER justified, and NO attack can touch\nhim with the poisoned sting of fear. Attest his\ninnocence and NOT his guilt. YOUR healing is his comfort and HIS health. BECAUSE\nit proves illusions were not true.\n\nIt is not Will for Life, but wish for death, that is the motivation\nfor this world. Its ONLY purpose is TO PROVE GUILT REAL. No worldly thought or\nact or feeling has a motivation other than this one. These are the witnesses that\nare called forth to be believed, and lend conviction to the system they speak for\nand represent. And each has many voices, speaking to your brother and yourself in\ndifferent tongues. And yet to both the message is the same. Adornment of the body\nseeks to show how lovely are the witnesses for guilt. Concerns about the body\ndemonstrate how frail and vulnerable is your life; how easily destroyed is what\nyou love. Depression speaks of death and vanity of real concern with anything at\nall.\n\nThe strongest witness to futility, which bolsters all the rest and\nhelps them paint the picture in which sin is justified, is sickness in whatever\nform it takes. The sick have reason for each one of their unnatural desires and\nstrange needs. For who could live a life so soon cut short, and NOT esteem the\nworth of passing joys? What pleasures COULD there be that will endure? Are not\nthe frail ENTITLED to believe that every stolen scrap of pleasure is their\nrighteous payment for their little lives? Their death will pay the price for all\nof them, if they enjoy the benefits or not. The end of life must come, whatever\nway that life be spent. And so take pleasure in the quickly passing and\nephemeral.\n\nThese are NOT sins, but witnesses unto the strange belief that sin and\ndeath are real, and innocence and sin will end alike, within the termination of\nthe grave. If this were true, there WOULD be reason to remain content to seek for\npassing joys, and cherish little pleasures where you can. But in this picture is\nthe body NOT perceived as neutral and WITHOUT a goal inherent in itself. For it\nbecomes the symbol of reproach,\nthe sign of guilt whose consequences still are there to see, so that the cause\ncan NEVER be denied. Your function is to PROVE to him that sin can HAVE no cause.\nHow futile MUST it be to see yourself a picture of the proof that what your\nfunction IS can never be.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's picture changes not the body into something it is\nnot. It only takes away from it ALL signs of accusation and of blamefullness.\nPictured WITHOUT a purpose, it is seen as neither sick nor well, nor bad nor\ngood. No grounds are offered that it may be judged in ANY way at all. It has no\nlife, but neither is it dead. It stands apart from ALL experience of fear OR\nlove. For now it witnesses to NOTHING yet, its purpose being open, and the mind\nmade free again to choose what it is FOR. Now it is not condemned, but waiting\nfor a purpose to be GIVEN, that it may fulfill the function that it will receive.\n\nInto this empty space, from which the GOAL of sin has been removed, is\nHeaven free to be remembered. Here its peace can come, and perfect healing take\nthe place of death. The body can become a sign of life, a promise of redemption,\nand a breath of immortality to those grown sick of breathing in the fetid scent\nof death. Let it have healing as its PURPOSE. Then will it send forth the message\nit received, and by its health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that\nit represents. Let it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever\nunattacked. And to your brother let its message be, “Behold me, brother, at your\nhand I live.”\n\nThe simple way to let this be achieved is merely this; to let the body\nhave no purpose from the past, when you were sure you KNEW its purpose was to\nfoster guilt.

    "content": "The Fear of Healing\n\nIs healing frightening? To many, yes. For accusation is a bar to love,\nand damaged bodies ARE accusers. They stand firmly in the way of trust and peace,\nproclaiming that the frail can HAVE no trust, and that the damaged HAVE no\ngrounds for peace. Who has been injured BY his brother, and could love and trust\nhim still? He HAS attacked, and will attack again. Protect him not, because your\ndamaged body shows that you must be protected FROM him. To forgive may be an act\nof charity, but NOT his due. He may be PITIED for his guilt, but NOT exonerated.\nAnd if you forgive him his transgressions, you but ADD to all the guilt that he\nhas really earned.\n\nThe unhealed CANNOT pardon. For they are the witnesses that pardon is\nunfair. They would retain the CONSEQUENCES of the guilt they overlook. Yet no-one\nCAN forgive a sin which he believes is real. And what has consequences MUST be\nreal, because what it has DONE is there to see. Forgiveness is NOT pity, which\nbut seeks to pardon what it knows to be the truth. Good cannot BE returned for\nevil, for forgiveness does not first ESTABLISH sin, and THEN forgive it. Who can\nsay and MEAN, “My brother, you have injured me, and yet, because I am the BETTER\nof the two, I pardon you my hurt.” HIS pardon and YOUR hurt can NOT exist\ntogether. One DENIES the other, and MUST make it false.\n\nTo witness sin, and yet forgive it, is a paradox which reason cannot\nsee. For it maintains what has been done to you DESERVES no pardon. And, by\nGIVING it, you grant your brother mercy, but retain the proof he is not REALLY\ninnocent. The sick remain accusers. They cannot forgive their brothers AND\nthemselves as well. For no-one in whom true forgiveness reigns CAN suffer. He\nholds not the proof of sin, before his brother's eyes. And thus he MUST have\noverlooked it, and removed it from his own. Forgiveness CANNOT be for one, and\nnot the other. Who forgives IS healed. And in his healing lies the PROOF that he\nhas truly pardoned, and retains no trace of condemnation that\nhe still would hold against himself or any living thing.\n\nForgiveness is not real UNLESS it brings a healing to your brother AND\nyourself. YOU must attest his sins had no effect on YOU, to demonstrate they were\nnot real. How else COULD he be guiltless? And how COULD his innocence be\njustified UNLESS his sins have no effect to WARRANT guilt? Sins are beyond\nforgiveness just BECAUSE they would entail effects which CANNOT be undone and\noverlooked entirely. In their UNDOING lies the proof that they were merely\nerrors. LET yourself be healed, that you may be forgiving, offering salvation to\nyour brother AND yourself. A broken body shows the mind has NOT been healed. A\nmiracle of healing proves that separation is WITHOUT effect.\n\nWhat you would prove to him you will believe. The power of witness\nCOMES from your belief. And everything you say or do or think but testifies to\nwhat you teach to him. Your body can be means to teach that it has never suffered\npain because of him. And in its healing can it offer him mute testimony to his\ninnocence. It is THIS testimony that can speak with power greater than a thousand\ntongues. For here is his forgiveness PROVED to him. A miracle can offer nothing\nLESS to him than it has given unto you. So does your healing show your mind is\nhealed, and has forgiven what he did NOT do. And so is HE convinced his innocence\nwas never lost, and healed along with you.\n\nThus does the miracle undo all things the world attests can never BE\nundone. And hopelessness and death MUST disappear before the ancient clarion call\nof life. This call has power FAR beyond the weak and miserable cry of death and\nguilt. The ancient Calling of the Father to His Son, and of the Son unto his own,\nwill yet be the last trumpet that the world will ever hear. Brother, there is no\ndeath. And this you learn when you but wish to show your brother that you had no\nhurt of him. He thinks your blood is on his hands, and so he stands condemned.\nBut it is given you\nto SHOW him, by your healing, that his guilt is but the fabric of a senseless\ndream.\n\nHow just are miracles! For they bestow an equal gift of full\ndeliverance from guilt upon your brother AND yourself. YOUR healing saves HIM\npain, as well as you. And YOU are healed BECAUSE you wished him well. This is the\nlaw the miracle obeys; That healing sees no specialness at all. It does NOT come\nfrom pity, but from love. And love would prove ALL suffering is but a vain\nimagining, a foolish wish with NO effects. Your health is a result of your desire\nto see your brother with no blood upon his hands, nor guilt upon his heart made\nheavy with the proof of sin. And what you wish is GIVEN you to see.\n\nThe “cost” of your serenity is his. This is the “price” the Holy\nSpirit and the world interpret differently. The world perceives in it a statement\nof the “fact” that your salvation SACRIFICES his. The Holy Spirit knows YOUR\nhealing is the witness UNTO his, and CANNOT be apart from him at all. As long as\nhe consents to suffer, YOU will be unhealed. But you can show him his suffering\nis purposeless and wholly without cause. Show him YOUR healing, and he will\nconsent no more to suffer. For his innocence HAS BEEN established in your sight\nAND his. And laughter will REPLACE your sighs BECAUSE God's Son remembered that\nhe IS God's Son.\n\nWho, then, fears healing? Only those to whom their brother's sacrifice\nand pain is seen to represent their own serenity. Their helplessness and weakness\nrepresent grounds on which they justify his pain. The constant sting of guilt he\nsuffers serves to prove that he is slave, and they are free. The constant pain\nTHEY suffer demonstrates that they are free BECAUSE they hold him bound. And\nsickness is desired to prevent a shift of balance in the sacrifice. How could the\nHoly Spirit be deterred an instant, even less, to reason with an argument for\nsickness such as this? And need YOUR healing be delayed because you pause to\nlisten to insanity?\n\nCorrection is NOT your function. It belongs to One Who knows of\nfairness, NOT of guilt. If you assume correction's role, you LOSE the function of\nforgiveness. No-one can forgive until he learns correction is BUT to forgive, and\nNEVER to accuse. Alone, you CANNOT see they are the same, and therefore is\ncorrection NOT of you. Identity and function are the same, and BY your function\ndo you know yourself. And thus, if you confuse your function with the function of\nAnother, you MUST be confused about yourself and who you are. What is the\nseparation but a wish to take God's Function from Him and DENY that it is His?\nYet if it is NOT His it is not YOURS, for YOU must lose what you would take away.\n\nIn a split mind, identity MUST seem to be divided. Nor can anyone\nperceive a function unified which has conflicting purposes and different ends.\nCorrection, to a mind so split, MUST be a way to punish sins you think are YOURS\nin someone else. And thus does he become your victim, NOT your brother, DIFFERENT\nfrom you in that he is MORE GUILTY, thus in need of your correction, as the one\nMORE INNOCENT than he. This splits HIS function off from yours, and gives you\nboth a DIFFERENT role. And so you CANNOT be perceived as one, and with a single\nfunction that would MEAN a shared identity with but ONE end.\n\nCorrection YOU would do MUST separate, because that is the function\ngiven it BY you. When you perceive correction is the SAME as pardon, then you\nalso know the Holy Spirit's Mind and yours are One. And so your OWN identity is\nfound. Yet must He work with what is GIVEN Him, and you allow Him only HALF your\nmind. And thus He represents the OTHER half, and seems to have a DIFFERENT\npurpose from the one you cherish, and you THINK is yours. Thus does your function\nseem DIVIDED, with a half IN OPPOSITION to a half. And these two halves appear to\nrepresent a split within a self perceived as two.\n\nConsider how this self perception MUST extend, and do not overlook the\nfact that EVERY thought extends, because that is its purpose, being what it\nreally IS. From an idea of self AS TWO, there comes a NECESSARY view of function\nsplit BETWEEN the two. And what you would correct is only HALF the error, which\nyou think is ALL of it. Your BROTHER'S sins become the central target for\ncorrection, lest your errors and his own be seen as one. YOURS are mistakes, but\nHIS are sins, and NOT the same as yours. HIS merit punishment, while yours, in\nfairness, should be overlooked.\n\nIn THIS interpretation of correction, your own mistakes you will not\neven SEE. The FOCUS of correction has been placed OUTSIDE yourself, on one who\nCANNOT be a part of you while this perception lasts. What is condemned can never\nbe returned to its accuser, who has hated it, AND HATES IT STILL. This is your\nbrother, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part of you, and thus OUTSIDE your\nself, the other half, which is denied. Only what is left, WITHOUT his presence,\nis perceived as ALL of you. To this remaining half the Holy Spirit must represent\nthe OTHER half, until you recognize it IS the other half. And this He does by\ngiving BOTH of you a function that is one, NOT different.\n\nCorrection IS the function given both, but neither one alone. And when\nit is fulfilled as SHARED, it MUST correct mistakes in both of you. It CANNOT\nleave mistakes in one unhealed, and make the other free. THAT is DIVIDED purpose,\nwhich cannot BE shared, and so it CANNOT be the function which the Holy Spirit\nsees as His. And you can rest assured that He will NOT fulfill a function that He\ncannot understand, and recognize as His. For only thus can He keep YOURS\npreserved intact, DESPITE your separated view of what your function IS. If He\nUPHELD divided function, you were lost indeed. His INABILITY to see His goal\ndivided and distinct for each of you preserves your Self from being made aware of\nany function OTHER than Its Own.\n\nAnd thus is healing given BOTH of you. Correction MUST be left to One\nWho knows correction and forgiveness ARE the same. With HALF a mind, this is NOT\nunderstood. Leave, then, correction to the Mind That IS united, functioning as\nOne BECAUSE It is not split in purpose, and conceives a single function as Its\nONLY one. Here is the function GIVEN It conceived to be Its Own, and NOT apart\nfrom that Its Giver keeps BECAUSE it has been shared. In His ACCEPTANCE of this\nfunction lies the means whereby your mind is unified. His SINGLE purpose unifies\nthe halves of you that you perceive as separate. And each forgives the other,\nthat he may accept his OTHER half as PART of him.",

    "content": "The Symbol of the Impossible\n\nPower can NOT oppose. For opposition would WEAKEN it, and weakened\npower is a contradiction in ideas. Weak strength is meaningless. And power used\nto weaken is EMPLOYED to limit. Thus it MUST be limited and weak, because that is\nits purpose. Power is UNopposed, to be itself. No weakness CAN intrude upon it\nwithout changing what it IS, to something it is not. To weaken IS to limit, and\nimpose an opposite that CONTRADICTS the concept it attacks. And BY its\ncontradiction does it JOIN to the idea a something it is not, and make it\nunintelligible. Who can understand a double concept, such as “weakened-power,” or\nas “hateful-love?”\n\nYou have decided that your brother IS a symbol for a “hateful-love,” a\n“weakened-power,” and, above all, a “living-death.” And so he has NO meaning to\nyou, for he stands for what is meaningless. He represents a double thought, where\nhalf is cancelled out by the remaining half. Yet even this is quickly\ncontradicted by the half it cancelled out, and so they BOTH are gone. And now he\nstands for nothing. Symbols which but represent ideas that cannot BE, must stand\nfor empty space and nothingness. Yet nothingness and empty space can NOT be\ninterference. What CAN interfere with the awareness of reality is the belief that\nthere is SOMETHING THERE.\n\nThe picture of your brother that you see means nothing. There is\nnothing to attack or to deny; to love or hate, or to endow with power or to see\nas weak. The picture has been wholly cancelled out, because it symbolized a\ncontradiction which cancelled out the THOUGHT it represents. And thus the picture\nhas no cause at all. Who can perceive effect WITHOUT a cause? What can the\ncauseless BE but nothingness. The picture of your brother that you see is wholly\nabsent, and has never been. Let, then, the empty space it occupies be RECOGNIZED\nas vacant, and the time devoted to its seeing be perceived as idly spent, a time\nunoccupied.\n\nAn empty space that is NOT seen as filled, an unused interval of time\nNOT seen as spent and fully occupied, become a silent invitation to the truth to\nenter, and to make Itself at home. No preparation CAN be made that would enhance\nthe invitation's real appeal. For what you leave as vacant GOD will fill, and\nwhere HE is, there MUST the truth abide. Unweakened Power, with NO opposite, is\nwhat creation IS. For this there are NO symbols. Nothing points BEYOND the truth,\nand what can stand for MORE than everything? Yet true undoing must be kind, and\nso the first replacement for your picture is ANOTHER picture, of ANOTHER kind.\n\nAs nothingness can not BE pictured, so there IS no symbol for\ntotality. Reality is ultimately known WITHOUT a form, unpictured and unseen.\nForgiveness is not yet a Power known as wholly free of limits. Yet it sets no\nlimits YOU have chosen to impose. Forgiveness is the means by which the truth is\nrepresented TEMPORARILY. It lets the Holy Spirit make EXCHANGE of pictures\npossible, until the time when aids are meaningless, and learning done. No\nlearning aid has use which can extend BEYOND the goal of learning. When its aim\nHAS BEEN accomplished, it is functionless. Yet, in the learning interval, it HAS\na use which now you fear, but yet will love.\n\nThe picture of your brother GIVEN you to occupy the space so lately\nleft unoccupied and vacant, will not need defense of ANY kind. For you will give\nit OVERWHELMING preference. Nor delay an instant in deciding that it is the ONLY\none you want. It does NOT stand for double concepts. Though it is but HALF the\npicture, and IS incomplete, WITHIN itself it is the same. The other half of what\nit represents remains unknown, but is NOT cancelled out. And thus is God left\nfree to take the final step Himself. For this you need NO pictures and NO\nlearning aids. And what will ultimately take the place of EVERY learning aid will\nmerely BE.\n\nForgiveness vanishes and symbols fade, and nothing that the eyes have\never seen, or ears have heard, remains to be perceived. A Power wholly limitless\nhas come, NOT to destroy, but to RECEIVE Its Own. There is no CHOICE of function\nanywhere. The choice you fear to lose you never HAD.

    "content": "The Quiet Answer\n\nIn quietness are all things answered, and is every problem quietly\nresolved. In conflict there can BE no answer and no resolution. For its PURPOSE\nis to make NO resolution possible, and to ensure NO answer will be plain. A\nproblem set in conflict HAS no answer, for it is seen in different ways. And what\nwould be an answer from one point of view is NOT an answer in another light. You\nARE in conflict. Thus it must be clear you cannot answer anything at all, for\nconflict HAS no limited effects. Yet, if God gave an Answer, there MUST be a way\nin which your problems are resolved, for what He wills already has been done.\n\nThus it MUST be that time is not involved, and every problem can be\nanswered now. Yet it must also be that in your state of mind, solution is\nimpossible. Therefore, God must have given you a way of reaching to ANOTHER state\nof mind, in which the answer is ALREADY THERE. Such is the Holy Instant. It is\nhere that ALL your problems should be brought and LEFT. Here they BELONG, for\nhere THEIR answer is. And where its answer is, a problem MUST be simple and be\neasily resolved. It MUST be pointless to attempt to solve a problem where the\nanswer cannot be. Yet, just as surely, it MUST be resolved, if it is brought to\nwhere the answer IS.\n\nAttempt to solve NO problems but within the Holy Instant's surety. For\nthere the problem WILL be answered and resolved. Outside, there will be no\nsolution, for there IS no answer there that could be found. Nowhere outside a\nsingle simple question is ever ASKED. The world can ONLY ask a double question,\nwith MANY answers, none of which will do. It does not ask a question to BE\nanswered, but only to restate its point of view. All questions asked within this\nworld are but a way of LOOKING, NOT a question asked. A question asked in hate\ncannot be answered, because it IS an answer in itself. A double question asks and\nanswers, both attesting the same thing, in different form.\n\nT 27 E 4. The world asks but one question. It is this: “Of these illusions,\nwhich of them are true? Which ones establish peace and offer joy? And which can\nbring escape from all the pain of which this world is made?” Whatever form the\nquestion takes, its purpose is the same. It asks but to ESTABLISH sin is real,\nand answers in the form of preference. “Which sin do you prefer?” That is the one\nthat you should choose. The OTHERS are not true. What can the body get that you\nwould want the most of all? It is your servant and your friend. But tell it what\nyou want, and it will serve you lovingly and well. And this is NOT a question,\nfor it TELLS you WHAT you want, and WHERE to go to ask for it. It leaves no room\nto question its beliefs, except that what it states takes question's FORM.\n\nA pseudo-question has no answer. It DICTATES the answer, even as it\nasks. Thus is all questioning within the world a form of propaganda for itself.\nJust as the body's witnesses are but the senses from WITHIN itself, so are the\nanswers to the questions of the world contained within the questions. Where\nanswers represent the QUESTIONS they add nothing new, and nothing has been\nlearned. An HONEST question is a learning tool which asks for something that you\ndo NOT know. It does NOT set conditions for response, but merely asks what the\nRESPONSE should be. And no-one in a conflict state is free to ASK this question,\nfor he does not WANT an honest answer, where the conflict ENDS.\n\nOnly within the Holy Instant can an honest question honestly be asked.\nAnd from the meaning of the QUESTION does the meaningfullness of the answer come.\nHere is it possible to separate your wishes FROM the answer, so it can be GIVEN\nyou, and also be RECEIVED. The answer is provided everywhere, but it is only here\nit can be HEARD. An honest answer asks NO sacrifice, because it answers questions\ntruly asked. The questions of the world but ask of whom is sacrifice demanded,\nasking NOT if sacrifice is meaningful at all. And so, UNLESS the answer tells “of\nwhom,” it will remain unrecognized, unheard, and thus the QUESTION is preserved\nintact, because it gave the answer to ITSELF.\n\nThe Holy Instant is the interval in which the mind is still enough to\nhear an answer that is NOT entailed within the question asked. It offers\nsomething new and DIFFERENT from the question. How COULD it be answered, if it\nbut repeats itself. Therefore, attempt to solve NO problem in a world from which\nthe answer has been barred. But bring the problem to the only place which holds\nthe answer lovingly FOR you. Here are the answers which will SOLVE your problems,\nbecause they stand APART from them, and see what CAN be answered; what the",

    "content": "The Healing Example\n\nThe ONLY way to heal is to be healed. The miracle extends WITHOUT your\nhelp. But you ARE needed that it can BEGIN. ACCEPT the miracle of healing, and it\nWILL go forth, because of what it IS. It is its NATURE to extend itself the\ninstant it is born. And it is born the instant it is offered and RECEIVED. No-one\ncan ask ANOTHER to be healed. But he can let HIMSELF be healed, and thus offer\nthe other what he has received. Who can bestow upon another what he does not\nHAVE? And who can SHARE what he denies HIMSELF? The Holy Spirit speaks to YOU. He\ndoes not speak to someone ELSE. Yet BY your listening, His Voice extends, BECAUSE\nyou have accepted what He says.\n\nHealth is the witness unto health. As long as it is unattested, it\nremains without conviction. Only when DEMONSTRATED has it BEEN proved, and MUST\ncompel belief. No-one is healed through double messages. If you wish ONLY to be\nhealed, you heal. Your single PURPOSE makes this possible. But if you are AFRAID\nof healing, then it cannot come through you. The ONLY thing that is required for\na healing is a lack of fear. The fearful are NOT healed, and cannot heal. This\ndoes NOT mean the conflict must be gone forever from your mind. For if it were,\nthere were no NEED for healing any more. But it DOES mean, if only for an\ninstant, you love without attack. An instant is sufficient. Miracles wait not on\ntime.\n\nThe holy instant is the miracle's abiding-place. From there, each one\nis born into this world, as witness to a state of mind which has TRANSCENDED\nconflict, and has reached to peace. It carries comfort from the place of peace\ninto the battleground, and DEMONSTRATES that war has no effects. For all the hurt\nthat war has sought to bring; the broken bodies and the shattered limbs, the\nscreaming dying and the silent dead, are gently lifted up and comforted. There IS\nno sadness, where a miracle has come to heal. And nothing more than just ONE\ninstant of your love WITHOUT attack is necessary, that all this occur.\n\nIn that ONE instant are YOU healed, and in that single instant is ALL\nhealing done. What stands APART from you, when you accept the blessing that the\nholy instant brings? Be not afraid of blessing for the One Who blesses you loves\nall the world, and leaves nothing within the world that COULD be feared. But if\nyou SHRINK from blessing, will the world indeed seem fearful, for you have\nWITHHELD its peace and comfort, leaving it to die. Would not a world so bitterly\nbereft be looked on as a condemnation by the one who COULD have saved it, but\nstepped back, because he was AFRAID of being healed? The eyes of all the dying\nbring reproach, and suffering whispers, “What is there to fear?”\n\nConsider well its question. It is asked of you on YOUR behalf. A dying\nworld asks only that you rest an instant from attack upon YOURSELF, that it be\nhealed. Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there\nreceived is left behind, on your returning to the world. And BEING blessed, you\nwill bring blessing. Life is given you, to give the dying world. And suffering\neyes no longer will accuse, but shine in thanks to you who blessing gave. The\nholy instant's radiance will light YOUR eyes, and give them sight to see beyond\nALL suffering, and see Christ's Face INSTEAD. Healing REPLACES suffering. Who\nlooks on one cannot PERCEIVE the other, for they CANNOT both be there. And what\nYOU see the world will witness, and will witness TO.\n\nThus is YOUR healing everything the world requires, that it may be\nhealed. It needs ONE lesson that has perfectly been learned. And then, when YOU\nforget it, will the world remind you gently of what you have taught. No\nreinforcement will its thanks withhold from you who let yourselves be healed,\nthat it might live. It will call forth its witnesses to show the Face of Christ\nto you who brought the sight to THEM, by which THEY witnessed it. The world of\naccusation is replaced by one in which all eyes look lovingly upon the\nfriend who brought them their release. And happily your brother will perceive the\nmany friends he thought were enemies.\n\nProblems are not specific, but they take specific forms, and these\nspecific shapes make up the world. And no-one understands the nature of his\nproblem. If he DID, it would be there no more for him to see. Its very NATURE is\nthat it is NOT. And thus, WHILE he perceives it, he can NOT perceive it as it is.\nBut HEALING is apparent in specific instances, and generalizes to include them\nall. This is because they really ARE the same, DESPITE their different forms. All\nlearning aims at transfer, which becomes complete within two situations which are\nseen as one. For ONLY common elements are there. But this can only be attained by\nOne Who does not see the DIFFERENCES you see.\n\nThe total transfer of your learning is NOT made by you. But that it\nHAS been made, IN SPITE of all the differences you see, convinces YOU that they\ncould not be real. Your healing WILL extend, and WILL be brought to problems that\nyou thought were NOT your own. And it will ALSO be apparent that your many\nDIFFERENT problems will be solved, as any ONE of them has been escaped. It CANNOT\nbe their differences which made this possible, for learning does not jump from\nsituations to their opposites, and bring the SAME effects. All healing MUST\nproceed in lawful manner, in accord with laws that have been properly perceived,\nbut NEVER violated. Fear you not the way that YOU perceive them. You ARE wrong,\nbut there is One within you Who is RIGHT.\n\nLeave, then, the transfer of your learning to the One Who REALLY\nunderstands its laws, and Who will GUARANTEE that they remain unviolated and\nunlimited. Your part is merely to apply what He has taught you TO YOURSELF, and\nHe will do the rest. And thus the power of your learning will be PROVED to you,\nby all the many DIFFERENT witnesses it finds. Your brother FIRST among them will\nbe seen, but thousands stand behind him, and beyond each one of them there are a\nthousand more. Each one may SEEM to have a problem which is DIFFERENT\nfrom the rest. Yet they are solved TOGETHER. And their common Answer shows the\nQUESTIONS could not have been separate.\n\nPeace be to you whom is healing offered. And you will learn that peace\nis given you, when you accept the healing for yourself. Its TOTAL value need not\nbe appraised by YOU, to let you understand that you have benefited from it. What\noccurred within the instant which love entered in WITHOUT attack, will stay with\nyou forever. YOUR healing will be ONE of its effects, as will your brother's.\nEverywhere you go, will you behold its multiplied effects. Yet all the witnesses\nthat you behold will be FAR less than all there really ARE. Infinity cannot be",

    "content": "The Purpose of Pain\n\nPain demonstrates the body must be real. It is a loud, obscuring\nvoice, whose shrieks would silence what the Holy Spirit says, and keep His words\nfrom your awareness. Pain compels attention, drawing it away from Him, and\nfocusing upon itself. Its purpose is the same as pleasure, for they both are\nmeans TO MAKE THE BODY REAL. What shares a common function IS the same. This is\nthe law of purpose, which unites all those who share in it within itself.\nPleasure and pain are EQUALLY unreal, because their purpose CANNOT be achieved.\nThus are they means for nothing, for they have a goal without a meaning. And they\nshare the lack of meaning that their PURPOSE has.\n\nSin shifts from pain to pleasure, and again to pain. For EITHER\nwitness is the same, and carries but one message, “You are here, WITHIN this\nbody, and you CAN be hurt. You can have pleasure, too, but ONLY at the cost of\npain.” These witnesses are joined by many more. Each one SEEMS different, because\nit has a different NAME, and so it seems to answer to a different SOUND. Except\nfor this, the witnesses of sin are all alike. Call pleasure “pain,” and it will\nhurt. Call pain pleasure, and the pain BEHIND the pleasure will be felt no more.\nSin's witnesses but shift from name to name, as one steps forward, and another,\nback. Yet which is foremost makes NO difference. Sin's witnesses hear but the\ncall of death.\n\nThis body, purposeless within itself, holds all your memories and all\nyour hopes. You use its eyes to see, its ears to hear, and let it TELL you what\nit is it feels. IT DOES NOT KNOW. It tells you but the NAMES you gave it to use,\nwhen YOU call forth the\nwitnesses to its reality. You cannot choose AMONG them which are real, for any\none you choose is like the rest. This name or that, but nothing more, you choose.\nYou do not MAKE a witness true, because you called him by truth's NAME. The truth\nis found in him IF IT IS TRUTH HE REPRESENTS. And otherwise he lies, if you\nshould call him by the Holy Name of God Himself.\n\nGod's Witness sees no witnesses AGAINST the body. Neither does He\nharken to the witnesses by OTHER names, which speak in OTHER ways for its\nreality. He KNOWS it is not real. For NOTHING could contain what you believe it\nholds within. Nor COULD it tell a Part of God Himself what It should feel, and\nwhat Its Function is. Yet must He love whatever YOU hold dear. And for each\nwitness to the body's death, He sends a witness to your Life in Him Who knows no\ndeath. Each miracle He brings is witness that the body is NOT real. Its pains and\npleasures does He heal alike, for ALL sin's witnesses do His replace.\n\nThe miracle makes NO distinctions in the names by which sin's\nwitnesses are called. It merely proves that what they REPRESENT has no effects.\nAnd this it proves BECAUSE its own effects have come to take their place. It\nmatters not the name by which you called your suffering. IT IS NO LONGER THERE.\nThe One Who brings the miracle perceived them all as one, and called by name of\n“fear.” As fear is witness unto death, so is the miracle the witness unto Life.\nIt is a witness no-one can deny, for it is the EFFECTS of life it brings. The\ndying live, the dead arise, and pain has vanished. Yet a miracle speaks not but\nfor itself, but what it REPRESENTS. Love, too, has symbols in a world of sin. The\nmiracle forgives BECAUSE\nit stands for what is PAST forgiveness, and is TRUE.\n\nHow foolish and insane it is to think a miracle is BOUND by laws which\nit came solely to UNDO. The laws of SIN have different witnesses, with different\nstrengths. And THEY attest to different suffering. Yet to the One Who sends forth\nmiracles to bless the world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly pleasure, and\nthe throes of death itself are but a single sound; a call for healing, and a\nplaintive cry for help within a world of misery. It is their SAMENESS that the\nmiracle attests. It is their SAMENESS that it PROVES. The laws which call them\nDIFFERENT are dissolved, and SHOWN as powerless. The PURPOSE of a miracle is to\naccomplish this. And God Himself has GUARANTEED the strength of miracles for what\nthey witness TO.\n\nBe witnesses unto the miracle, and NOT the laws of sin. There is no\nNEED to suffer any more. But there IS need that you be healed, because the\nsuffering of the world has made it deaf to its salvation and deliverance. The\nresurrection of the world awaits YOUR healing and YOUR happiness, that you may\nDEMONSTRATE the healing of the world. The holy instant will replace ALL sin, if\nyou but carry its effects with you. And no-one will ELECT to suffer more. What",

    "content": "The Illusion of Suffering\n\nSuffering is an emphasis upon all that the world has done to injure\nYOU. Here is the world's demented version of salvation clearly shown. Like to a\ndream of punishment, in which the dreamer is unconscious of what brought on the\nattack against himself, he sees himself attacked unjustly, and by something NOT\nhimself. HE is the victim of this “something else,” a thing OUTSIDE himself for\nwhich he has no reason to be held responsible. He must be innocent BECAUSE he\nknows not what HE does, but what is done TO him. Yet is his own attack upon\nhimself apparent still, for it is he who bears the suffering. And he can NOT\nescape BECAUSE its source is seen outside himself.\n\nNow you are being shown you CAN escape. All that is needed is you look\nupon the problem as it IS, and NOT the way that you have set it up. How COULD\nthere be another way to solve a problem which is VERY simple, but has been\nobscured by heavy clouds of complication, which were MADE to keep the problem\nunresolved? WITHOUT the clouds, the problem will emerge in all its primitive\nsimplicity. The choice will NOT be difficult, because the problem is absurd when\nclearly seen. No-one has difficulty making up his mind to let a simple problem be\nresolved, if it is SEEN as hurting him, and also very easily removed.\n\nThe “reasoning” by which the world is made, on which it rests, by\nwhich it is maintained, is simply this: “YOU are the cause of what I do. Your\npresence JUSTIFIES my wrath, and you exist and think APART from me. While YOU\nattack, I MUST be innocent. And what I suffer from IS your attack.” No-one who\nlooks upon this “reasoning” EXACTLY as it is could fail to see it does NOT\nfollow, and it makes NO sense. Yet it SEEMS sensible, because it LOOKS as if the\nworld WERE hurting you. And so it seems as if there is no NEED to go beyond the\nobvious in terms of cause.\n\nThere is INDEED a need. The world's ESCAPE from condemnation is a need\nwhich those WITHIN the world are joined in sharing. Yet they do not recognize\ntheir common need. For each one thinks that, if he does his part, the\ncondemnation of the world will rest on him. And it is this that he perceives to\nBE his part in its deliverance. Vengeance must have a focus. Otherwise, is the\navenger's knife in his own hand, and pointed to himself. And he MUST see it in\nANOTHER hand, if he would be a victim of attack he did NOT choose. And thus he\nsuffers from the wounds a knife he does not HOLD has made upon himself.\n\nThis is the PURPOSE of the world he sees. And, LOOKED AT thus, the\nworld provides the means by which this purpose SEEMS to be fulfilled. The means\nATTEST the purpose, but are NOT themselves a cause. Nor will the CAUSE be changed\nby seeing it APART from its effects. The cause PRODUCES the effects, which then\nbear witness to the CAUSE, and NOT themselves. Look, then, BEYOND effects. It is\nNOT here the CAUSE of suffering and sin must lie. And dwell not on the suffering\nand sin, for they are but REFLECTIONS of their cause. The part you play in\nSALVAGING the world from condemnation IS your own escape.\n\nForget not that the witness to the world of evil cannot speak EXCEPT\nfor what has seen a NEED for evil in the world. And this is where YOUR guilt was\nfirst beheld. In separation from your brother was the first attack upon yourself\nbegun. And it is THIS the world bears witness to. Seek not another cause, nor\nlook among the mighty legions of its witnesses for its undoing. They SUPPORT its\nclaim on your allegiance. What CONCEALS the truth is not where you should look to\nFIND the truth. The witnesses to sin all stand within ONE little space. And it is\nHERE you find the CAUSE of your perspective on the world.\n\nOnce you were unaware of what the cause of everything the world\nappeared to thrust upon you, uninvited and unasked, must REALLY be. Of one thing\nyou were sure; of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and\nsuffering to you, your guilt was NOT among them. Nor did you, in ANY way, REQUEST\nthem for yourself. This is how ALL illusions come about. The one who makes them\ndoes NOT see himself as making them, and their reality does NOT depend on him.\nWhatever cause they have is something quite APART from him, and what he sees is\nSEPARATE from his mind.\n\nHe CANNOT doubt his dreams' reality BECAUSE he does not see the part\nhe plays in MAKING them, and MAKING them seem real. No-one can waken from a dream\nthe world is dreaming FOR him. He becomes a part of someone ELSE'S dream. He\nCANNOT choose to waken from a dream he did not make. Helpless he stands, a victim\nto a dream conceived and cherished by a SEPARATE mind. Careless indeed of him\nthis mind must be, as thoughtless of his peace and happiness as is the weather,\nor the time of day. It loves him not, but casts him as it will, in any role that\nsatisfies its dream.\n\nSo little is his worth that he is but a dancing shadow, leaping up and\ndown, according to a senseless plot conceived within the idle dreaming of the\nworld. This is the ONLY picture you can see, the ONE alternative that you can\nchoose, the OTHER possibility of cause, if you be NOT the dreamer of your dreams.\nAnd this IS what you choose, if you deny the cause of suffering is in YOUR mind.\nBe glad indeed it is, for thus are YOU the ONE decider of your destiny in time.\nThe choice IS yours to make between a sleeping death and dreams of evil, or a\nhappy wakening and joy of life.\n\nWhat COULD you choose between, but life or death, waking or sleeping,\nwar or peace, your dream or your reality? But if the choice is REALLY given you,\nthen you must see the causes of the things you choose BETWEEN exactly AS they are\nand WHERE they are. What choices can be made between two states, but ONE of which\nis clearly recognized? Who could be free to choose BETWEEN effects, when only ONE\nis seen as up to you? An honest choice could NEVER be perceived as one in which\nthe choice is split between a tiny you and an enormous world, with DIFFERENT\ndreams about the truth in you.\n\nThe gap between reality and dreams lies not between the dreaming of\nthe world and what you dream in secret. THEY are one. The dreaming of the world\nis but a part of your own dream you gave away, and saw as if it were its start\nand ending, both. Yet was it started by your SECRET dream, which you do NOT\nperceive, although it CAUSED the part you see and do not doubt is real. How COULD\nyou doubt it, while you lie asleep, and dream in secret that its CAUSE is real? A\nbrother SEPARATED from yourself, an ancient enemy, a murderer who stalks you in\nthe night and plots your death, yet plans that it be lingering and slow, –\n\nOf this you dream. And, UNDERNEATH this dream, is yet another, in\nwhich YOU become the murderer, the secret enemy, the scavenger and the destroyer\nof the brother and the world you fear alike. Here is the CAUSE of suffering, the\nspace BETWEEN your dreams and your reality. The little gap you do not even see,\nthe birthplace of illusions and of fear, the time of terror and of ancient hate,\nthe instant of disaster; – all are here. Here is the CAUSE of unreality. And it\nis here that it will be undone. YOU are the dreamer of the world of dreams. No\nOTHER cause it has, nor ever will.\n\nNothing more fearful than an idle dream has terrified God's Son, and\nmade him think that he has lost his innocence, denied his Father, and made war\nupon himself. So fearful is the dream, so seeming real, he could not waken to\nreality without the sweat of terror and a scream of mortal fear, unless a gentler\ndream preceded his awaking, and allowed his calmer mind to welcome, NOT to fear,\nthe Voice that called with love to waken him. A gentler dream, in which his\nsuffering was healed, and where his brother was his friend. God willed he waken\ngently, and with joy. And GAVE him means to waken WITHOUT fear. Accept the dream\nHe gave, INSTEAD of yours. It is NOT difficult to shift a dream, when once the\ndreamer has been recognized.\n\nRest in the Holy Spirit, and allow His gentle dreams to take the place\nof those you dreamed in terror, and in fear of death. He brings FORGIVING dreams,\nin which the choice is NOT who is the murderer, and who shall be the victim. In\nthe dreams HE brings, there IS no murder, and there IS no death. The dream of\nguilt is fading from your sight, although your eyes are closed. A smile has come\nto lighten up your sleeping face. The sleep is peaceful now, for these are happy\ndreams. Dream softly of your sinless brother, who unites with you in holy\ninnocence. And, from THIS dream, the Lord of Heaven will Himself awaken His\nbeloved Son.\n\nDream of your brother's kindnesses INSTEAD of dwelling in your dreams\non his mistakes. Select his thoughtfulness to dream about, INSTEAD of counting up\nthe hurts he gave. Forgive him his illusions, and give thanks to him for all the\nhelpfulness he gave. And do not brush aside his many gifts, because he is not\nperfect in your dreams. He represents his Father, Whom you see as offering both\nlife AND death to you. Brother, He gives BUT life, and what you see as gifts your\nbrother offers REPRESENT the gifts you dream your Father gives to you. Let all\nyour brother's gifts be seen in light of charity and kindness offered you. And\nlet no pain disturb your dream of deep appreciation for his gifts to you.",

    "content": "The “Hero” of the Dream\n\nThe body is the central figure in the dreaming of the world. There IS\nno dream without it, nor does it exist without the dream, in which it acts as if\nit were a person, to be seen and be believed. It takes the central place in every\ndream, which tells the story of how it was made by OTHER bodies, born into the\nworld OUTSIDE the body, lives a little while, and dies, to be united in the dust\nwith other bodies, dying like itself. In the brief time allotted it to live, it\nseeks for other bodies as its friends and enemies. Its safety is its main\nconcern. Its comfort is its guiding rule. It tries to look for pleasure, and\navoid the things that would be hurtful. Above all, it tries to teach itself its\npains and joys are different, and CAN be told apart.\n\nThe dreaming of the world takes many forms, because the body seeks in\nmany ways to PROVE it is autonomous and real. It puts things on itself that it\nhas bought with little metal discs or paper strips the world proclaims as\nvaluable and good. It works to get them, doing senseless things, and tosses them\naway for senseless things it does not NEED, and does not even WANT. It hires\nOTHER bodies, that they may protect it, and collect more senseless things that it\ncan call its own. It looks about for special bodies which can SHARE its dream.\nSometimes it dreams it is a conqueror of bodies weaker than itself. But in some\nphases of the dream, it is the slave of bodies which would hurt and torture it.\n\nThe body's serial adventures, from the time of birth to dying is the\ntheme of every dream the world has ever had. The “hero” of this dream will never\nchange, nor will its purpose. Though the dream itself takes many forms, and SEEMS\nto show a great variety of places and events wherein its “hero” finds itself, the\ndream has but ONE purpose, taught in many ways. This single lesson does it try to\nteach again, and still again, and yet once more; - that it is CAUSE and NOT\neffect. And YOU are ITS effect, and CANNOT be its cause. Thus are you NOT the\ndreamer, but the DREAM. And so you wander idly in and out of places and events\nthat IT contrives.\n\nThat this is all the BODY does is true, for it IS but a figure in a\ndream. But who REACTS to figures in a dream, UNLESS he sees them as if they were\nreal?\nThe INSTANT that he sees them as they ARE, they HAVE no more effects on him\nBECAUSE he understands he GAVE them their effects BY CAUSING THEM, and MAKING\nthem seem real. How willing are you to ESCAPE effects of all the dreams the world\nhas ever had? Is it your wish to let NO dream appear to be the cause of what it\nis YOU do? Then let us merely look upon the dream's beginning, for the part you\nsee is but the SECOND part, whose CAUSE lies in the first.\n\nNo-one asleep and dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon\nhimself. No-one believes there really was a time when he knew nothing of a body,\nand could never have conceived this world as real. He would have seen at once\nthat these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for anything but to be laughed\naway. How serious they now appear to be! And no-one can remember when they would\nhave met with laughter and with disbelief. We CAN remember this, if we but look\ndirectly at their CAUSE. And we will see the grounds for laughter, NOT a cause\nfor fear. Let us return the dream he gave away unto the dreamer, who perceives\nthe dream as SEPARATE from himself, and done to him.\n\nInto eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at\nwhich the Son of God remembered not to laugh. In his forgetting did the thought\nbecome a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real effects.\nTogether, we can laugh them BOTH away, and understand that time can NOT intrude\nupon eternity. It IS a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity,\nwhich MEANS there is no time. A timelessness in which is time made real; a Part\nof God Which can attack Itself; a separate brother as an enemy; a mind WITHIN a\nbody; all are forms of circularity, whose ending starts at its beginning, ending\nat its cause.\n\nThe world you see depicts EXACTLY what you thought YOU did. Except\nthat NOW you think that what you did is being done to YOU. The guilt for what YOU\nthought is being placed OUTSIDE yourself, and on a guilty world which dreams your\ndreams, and thinks your thoughts INSTEAD of you. It brings ITS vengeance, not\nyour own. IT keeps you narrowly confined within a body, which it punishes because\nof all the sinful things the body does within ITS dream. You have NO power to\nmake the body stop its evil deeds, because you did NOT make it, and can NOT\ncontrol its actions, or its purpose, or its fate.\n\nThe world but demonstrates an ancient truth; - you WILL believe that\nothers do to you EXACTLY what you think you did to them. But, once deluded into\nblaming THEM, you will not see the CAUSE of what they do BECAUSE you want the\nguilt to rest on them. How childish is this petulant device to keep your\ninnocence by pushing guilt OUTSIDE yourself, but NEVER letting go! It is not easy\nto perceive the jest, when all around you do your eyes behold its heavy\nconsequences, but WITHOUT their trifling cause. Without the cause do its effects\nseem serious and sad indeed. Yet they but follow. And it is their CAUSE which\nfollows nothing, and is but a jest.\n\nIn gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause, and looks\nNOT to effects. How else could He correct YOUR error, who have OVERLOOKED the\ncause entirely? He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him, that you may look\nTOGETHER on its foolish cause, and laugh with Him a while. YOU judge effects, but\nHE has judged their CAUSE. And by His judgment are effects removed. Perhaps you\ncome in tears, but hear Him say, “My brother, Holy Son of God, behold your idle\ndream, in which this could occur,” and you will leave the holy instant with your\nlaughter and your brother's JOINED with His.\n\nT 27 I 10. The secret of salvation is but this: That YOU are doing this UNTO\nYOURSELF. No matter what the form of the attack, this STILL is true. Whoever\ntakes the role of enemy and of attacker, STILL is this the truth. Whatever seems\nto be the cause of any pain and suffering you feel, this is STILL true. For you\nwould not react at all to figures in a dream you knew that YOU were dreaming. Let\nthem be as hateful and as vicious as they may, they COULD have no effect on you,\nunless you failed to recognize it is YOUR dream. This single lesson learned will\nset you free from suffering, WHATEVER form it takes.\n\nThe Holy Spirit will repeat this ONE inclusive lesson of deliverance,\nuntil it has been learned, REGARDLESS of the form of suffering that brings you\npain. Whatever hurt you bring to Him, He will make answer with this very simple\ntruth. For this one answer TAKES AWAY the cause of every form of sorrow and of\npain. The form affects His answer not at all, for He would teach you but the\nSINGLE cause of all of them, no matter WHAT their form. And you will understand\nthat miracles reflect the simple statement, “I have done this thing, and it is\nthis I would undo.”\n\nBring, then, all forms of suffering to Him Who knows that every one is\nlike the rest. He sees NO differences where none exist, and He will teach you how\neach one is CAUSED. None has a DIFFERENT cause from all the rest, and ALL of them\nare easily undone by but a SINGLE lesson truly learned. Salvation is a secret you\nhave kept but from yourself. The universe proclaims it so. But, to its witnesses,\nyou pay no heed at all. For they attest the thing you do not WANT to know. They\nseem to keep it secret FROM you. Yet you need but learn you choose but NOT to\nlisten, NOT to see.\n\nHow differently will you perceive the world, when this is recognized!\nWhen you forgive the world YOUR guilt, YOU will be free of it. Its innocence does\nNOT demand your guilt, nor does YOUR guiltlessness rest on ITS sins. This is the\nobvious, a secret kept from no-one but yourself. And it is this that has\nmaintained you SEPARATE from the world, and kept your brother SEPARATE from you.\nNow need you but to learn that BOTH of you are innocent OR guilty. The one thing\nthat is impossible is that you be UNLIKE each other; that they BOTH be true. This\nis the only secret yet to learn. And it will be NO secret you are healed.",

And what it takes away is long since gone, but, being kept in memory,\nAPPEARS to have immediate effects. This world was over long ago. The thoughts\nthat made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them, and loved them for a\nwhile. The miracle but shows the past is gone, and what has truly gone HAS no\neffects.

It is perception of the past, as if it were\noccurring NOW, and still were there to see. Memory, like perception, is a skill\nmade up by you, to take the place of what God GAVE in your creation. And, like\nall the things you made, it can be used to serve ANOTHER purpose, and to be means\nfor something ELSE. It can be used to heal, and NOT to hurt, if you so wish.\n\nNothing employed for healing represents an effort to do anything at\nall. It is a recognition that you HAVE no needs which mean that something must be\nDONE. It is an unselective memory, which is NOT used to INTERFERE with truth. All",

    "content": "The Present Memory\n\nThe Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Himself is\nthere. But this is NOT a memory of past events, but ONLY of a PRESENT state.\n\nYou are so long accustomed to believe that memory holds only what is\npast, that it is hard for you to realize it is a skill that CAN remember NOW. The\nlimitations on remembering the world imposes on it are as vast as those you let\nthe world impose on YOU. There IS no link of memory to the past. If YOU would\nhave it there, then there it IS. But ONLY your desire made the link, and ONLY you\nhave held it to a part of time where guilt appears to linger still. The Holy\nSpirit's use of memory is quite APART from time. He does NOT seek to use it as a\nmeans to KEEP the past, but rather as a way TO LET IT GO.\n\nMemory holds a message it receives, and does what it is GIVEN it to\ndo. It does NOT write the message, nor appoint what it is FOR. Like to the body,\nit is purposeless within itself. And if it seems to serve to cherish ancient\nhate, and offer you the pictures of injustices and hurts that you were saving,\nthis is what you asked its message BE, and this is what it IS. Committed to its\nvaults, the history of all the body's past is hidden there. All of the strange\nassociations made to keep the past alive, the present dead, are stored within it,\nwaiting your command that they be brought to you, and lived again. And thus do\ntheir effects appear to be INCREASED by time, which TOOK AWAY their cause.\n\nYet time is but another phase of what DOES NOTHING. It works hand in\nhand with all the other attributes with which you sought to keep concealed the\ntruth about yourself. Time neither takes away, nor can restore. And yet you make\nstrange use of it, as if the past had CAUSED the present, which is but a\nCONSEQUENCE, in which no change can be made possible, because its cause has GONE.\nAnd change must have a cause that will endure, or else it will not last. No\nchange can be made in the present, if its cause is PAST. ONLY the past is held in\nmemory, as you make use of it, and so it is a way to hold the past AGAINST the\nnow.\n\nRemember NOTHING that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught.\nWho would keep a senseless lesson in his mind, when he can learn and can preserve\na BETTER one? When ancient memories of hate appear, remember that their cause is\ngone. And so you CANNOT understand what they are FOR. Let not the cause that you\nwould give them NOW be what it was that made them what they were, or seemed to\nbe. Be GLAD that it is gone, for this is what you would be pardoned FROM. And\nsee, instead, the NEW effects of cause accepted NOW, with consequences HERE.\n\nThey will surprise you with their loveliness. The ancient NEW ideas\nthey bring will be the happy consequences of a cause so ancient that it FAR\nexceeds the span of memory that your perception sees. This is the Cause the Holy\nSpirit has remembered FOR you, when you would forget. It is NOT past, because He\nlet it not be unremembered. It has never changed, because there never was a time\nin which He did not keep it safely in your mind. Its consequences will indeed\nSEEM new, because you thought that you remembered not their Cause. Yet, was It\nNEVER absent from your mind, for it was NOT your Father's Will that He be\nunremembered by His only Son.\n\nWhat YOU remember never WAS. It came from causelessness which you\nCONFUSED with cause. It CAN deserve but laughter, when you learn you have\nremembered consequences which were causeless, and could never BE effects. The\nmiracle reminds you of a Cause forever present, perfectly untouched by time and\ninterference. NEVER changed from what It IS. And YOU are Its effects, as\nchangeless and as perfect as Itself. Its memory does NOT lie in the past, nor\nwaits the future. It is NOT revealed in miracles. They but remind you that It\nhas not gone. When you forgive It for YOUR sins, It will no longer BE denied.\n\nYou who have sought to lay a judgment on your own Creator, cannot\nunderstand it is NOT He Who laid a judgment on His Son. You would DENY Him His\neffects, yet have they never BEEN denied. There WAS no time in which His Son\ncould be condemned for what was causeless, and AGAINST His Will. What YOUR\nremembering would witness to, is but the fear of God. He has not DONE the thing\nyou fear. No more have YOU. And so your innocence has NOT been lost. You need NO\nhealing to be healed. In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause\nto have Its OWN effects, and doing NOTHING that would interfere.\n\nThe miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant, and is\nstill. It reaches gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it healed in\nquiet then, to other minds to SHARE its quietness. And they will JOIN in doing\nnothing to prevent its radiant extension back into the Mind that caused ALL minds\nto be. Born out of sharing, there can BE no pause in time to cause the miracle\ndelay in hastening to all unquiet minds, and bringing them an instant's\nstillness, when the memory of God returns to them. Their OWN remembering is quiet\nnow, and what has come to take its place will not be wholly unremembered\nafterwards.\n\nHe to Whom time is given offers thanks for every quiet instant given\nHim. For in that instant is His memory allowed to offer all its treasures to the\nSon of God, for whom they have been kept. How gladly does He offer them unto the\none for whom He has been given them! And His Creator SHARES His thanks, because\nHe would not be deprived of His effects. The instant's silence that His Son\naccepts gives welcome to eternity and Him, and lets them enter where they would\nabide. For in that instant does the Son of God do NOTHING that would make himself\nafraid.\n\nHow instantly the memory of God arises in the mind that has no fear to\nkeep the memory away. Its own remembering has gone. There IS no past to keep its\nfearful image in the way of glad awakening to present peace. The trumpets of\neternity resound throughout the stillness, yet disturb it not. And what is NOW\nremembered is not fear, but rather is the Cause that fear was made to render\nunremembered and undone. The stillness speaks in gentle sounds of love the Son of\nGod remembers from BEFORE his own remembering came IN BETWEEN the present and the\npast, to shut them out.\n\nNow is the Son of God at last aware of PRESENT Cause and Its benign\neffects. Now does he understand what he has made is causeless, making NO effects\nat all. He HAS done nothing. And, in seeing THIS, he understands he never had a\nNEED for doing ANYTHING, and never did. His Cause IS Its effects. There never WAS\na cause besides It, that could generate a DIFFERENT past or future. ITS effects\nare changelessly eternal, BEYOND fear, and PAST the world of sin entirely. What\nhas been lost to see the causeless NOT? And where is sacrifice, when memory of\nGod has come to TAKE THE PLACE of loss?\n\nWhat better way to close the little gap between illusions and reality\nthan to allow the memory of God to flow ACROSS it, making it a bridge an instant\nwill suffice to reach beyond? For God has closed it with Himself. His memory has\nNOT gone by, and left a stranded Son forever on a shore where he can glimpse\nANOTHER shore which he can never reach. His Father wills that he be lifted up,\nand gently carried over. HE has built the bridge, and it is He Who will transport\nHis Son across it. Have no fear that He will fail in what He wills. Nor that you\nbe excluded from the Will that IS for you.",

    "content": "Reversing Effect and Cause\n\nWithout a cause there can be no effects, and yet, without effects,\nthere is no CAUSE. The cause a cause is MADE by its effects; the Father IS a\nfather by His Son. Effects do not CREATE their cause, but they ESTABLISH its\ncausation. Thus the Son gives fatherhood to his Creator, and RECEIVES the gift\nthat he has given Him. It is BECAUSE he is God's Son that he must ALSO be a\nfather, who creates as God created him. The circle of creation has no end. Its\nstarting and its ending are the same. But, in itself, it holds the universe of\nall creation, without beginning AND without an end.\n\nFatherhood is creation. Love MUST be extended. Purity is not confined.\nIt is the NATURE of the innocent to be forever uncontained, without a barrier or\nlimitation. Thus is purity NOT of the body. Nor can it be FOUND where limitation\nis. The body CAN be healed by its EFFECTS, which are as limitless as is itself.\nYet must all healing come about because the mind is recognized as NOT within the\nbody, and its innocence is quite APART from it, and where ALL healing IS. Where,\nthen, is healing? ONLY where its cause is GIVEN its effects. For sickness is a\nmeaningless attempt to give effects to causelessness, and MAKE it be a cause.\n\nAlways in sickness does the Son of God attempt to make himself his\ncause, and NOT allow himself to be his Father's Son. For this impossible desire,\nhe does not believe that he is Love's EFFECTS, and must be cause BECAUSE of what\nhe is. The cause of healing is the ONLY Cause of everything. It has but ONE\neffect. And, in that recognition, causelessness is GIVEN no effects, and none are\nSEEN. A mind within a body, and a world of other bodies, each with SEPARATE\nminds, are your “creations,” you the “other” mind, creating with effects UNLIKE\nyourself. And, AS their father, you must be like them.\n\nNothing at all has happened, but that you have put yourself to sleep,\nand dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of\nsomeone ELSE'S dream. The miracle does not awaken you, but merely shows you\nwho the DREAMER is. It teaches you there IS a choice of dreams while you are\nstill asleep, depending on the PURPOSE of your dreaming. Do you wish for dreams\nof healing, or for dreams of death? A dream is like a memory, in that it pictures\nwhat you WANTED shown to you. An empty storehouse, with an open door, holds ALL\nyour shreds of memories and dreams.\n\nYet, if you are the DREAMER, you perceive this much at least; that YOU\nhave caused the dream, and can accept ANOTHER dream as well. But, for this change\nin content of the dream, it MUST be realized that it is YOU who dreamed the\ndreaming that you do not like. It is but an effect that YOU have caused, and you\nwould not BE cause of this effect. In dreams of murder and attack are YOU the\nvictim, in a dying body slain. But, in forgiving dreams, is NO-ONE asked to be\nthe victim and the sufferer. These are the happy dreams the miracle exchanges for\nyour own. It does NOT ask you make another. ONLY that you see you made the one\nyou would EXCHANGE for this.\n\nThis world is CAUSELESS, as is every dream that anyone has dreamed\nwithin the world. No plans are possible, and no design exists that could be found\nand understood. What else could be EXPECTED from a thing that has no cause? But,\nif it HAS no cause, IT HAS NO PURPOSE. You may cause a dream, but never will you\ngive it real EFFECTS. For that would change its CAUSE, and it is this you CANNOT\ndo. The dreamer of a dream is NOT awake, but does NOT know he sleeps. He sees\nILLUSIONS of himself as sick or well, depressed or happy, but without a stable\ncause with GUARANTEED effects.\n\nThe miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not\ntrue. This is a crucial step in dealing with illusions. No-one is AFRAID of them,\nwhen he perceives HE MADE THEM UP. The fear was held in place BECAUSE he did not\nsee that he was AUTHOR of the dream, and not a figure IN the dream. He gives\nHIMSELF the consequences that he dreams he gave his brother. And it is but this\nthe dream has put together and has offered him, to show him that his wishes have\nbeen done. Thus does he fear his OWN attack, but sees it at another's\nhands. As victim, he is suffering from its effects, but NOT their cause. He\nauthored NOT his own attack, and he is innocent of what he caused.\n\nThe miracle does nothing but to show him that HE has done nothing.\nWhat he fears is cause WITHOUT the consequences which would MAKE it cause. And so\nit never was. The separation started with the dream the Father was deprived of\nHis effects, and powerless to keep them, since He was no longer their Creator. In\nthe dream, the dreamer made HIMSELF, but what he made had turned AGAINST him,\ntaking on the role of its creator, as the dreamer had. And, as he hated HIS\nCreator, so the figures in the dream have hated HIM. His body is their slave,\nwhich they abuse because the motives HE has given it have THEY adopted as their\nown. And hate it for the vengeance IT would offer THEM.\n\nIt is THEIR vengeance on the body which appears to prove the dreamer\nCOULD not be the maker of the dream. Effect and cause are first split off, and\nthen REVERSED, so that effect becomes a cause; the cause, effect. This is the\nseparation's final step, with which salvation, which proceeds to go the OTHER\nway, begins. This final step is an effect of what has gone before, APPEARING as a\ncause. The miracle is the first step in giving BACK to cause the function of\ncausation, NOT effect. For THIS confusion has produced the dream, and, while it\nlasts, will wakening be feared. Nor will the Call to wakening be heard, because\nit SEEMS to be the call of fear.\n\nLike EVERY lesson which the Holy Spirit requests you learn, the\nmiracle is clear. It DEMONSTRATES what He would have you learn, and SHOWS you its\neffects are what you WANT. In its forgiving dream, are the EFFECTS of yours\nundone, and hated enemies perceived as friends, with merciful intent. Their\nenmity is seen as causeless now, BECAUSE they did not make it. And you can accept\nthe role of maker of their hate BECAUSE you see that it has no effects. Now are\nyou freed from this much of the dream; the world is neutral, and the bodies which\nstill seem to move about as separate things NEED NOT BE FEARED. And so they are\nNOT sick.\n\nThe miracle returns the CAUSE of fear to you who made it. But it ALSO\nshows that, HAVING no effects, it is NOT cause, because the function of causation\nis to HAVE effects. And where effects are gone, there IS no cause. Thus is the\nbody healed by miracles BECAUSE they show the mind MADE sickness, and employed\nthe body to be victim, or EFFECT, of what it made. But HALF the lesson will not\nteach the whole. The miracle is useless, if you learn but that the BODY can be\nhealed, for this is NOT the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the MIND\nwas sick that thought the body COULD be sick; projecting OUT its guilt caused\nNOTHING, and had NO effects.\n\nThis world is full of miracles. They stand in shining silence next to\nevery dream of pain and suffering, of sin and guilt. They are the dream's\nALTERNATIVE, the choice to be the dreamer, rather than deny the active role in\nmaking up the dream. They are the glad effects of taking back the consequence of\nsickness to its cause. The body is released, because the mind acknowledges “this\nis not DONE TO me, but I am doing this.” And thus the mind is free to make",

    "content": "The Agreement to Join\n\nWhat waits in perfect certainty BEYOND salvation is not our concern.\nFor you have barely started to allow your first, uncertain steps to be directed\nup the ladder separation led you down. The miracle alone is your concern at\npresent. Here is where we must BEGIN. And, having started, will the way be made\nserene and simple in the rising up to waking and the ending of the dream. When\nyou accept a miracle, you do not ADD your dream of fear to one that is ALREADY\nbeing dreamed. Without SUPPORT the dream will fade away, without effects. For it\nis your SUPPORT that strengthens it. No mind is sick until another mind AGREES\nthat they are separate. And thus, it is their JOINT decision to be sick.\n\nIf you WITHHOLD agreement, and accept the part YOU play in making\nsickness real, the other mind cannot project its guilt without your aid in\nLETTING it perceive itself as separate and apart from YOU. Thus is the body NOT\nperceived as sick by BOTH your minds, from SEPARATE points of view. UNITING with\na brother's mind prevents the CAUSE of sickness, and perceived effects. Healing\nis the effect of minds that join, as sickness comes from minds that separate. The\nmiracle does nothing just because the minds ARE joined, and CANNOT separate. Yet,\nin the dreaming, has this been reversed, and separate minds are seen as bodies,\nwhich ARE separated, and which cannot JOIN.\n\nDo not allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have YOU abandoned\nhim to his own dream, by SHARING it with him. He has not seen the cause of\nsickness where it is, and YOU have overlooked the gap between you, where the\nsickness has been bred. Thus are you JOINED in sickness, to preserve the little\ngap unhealed, where sickness is kept carefully protected, cherished, and upheld\nby firm belief, lest God should come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him.\nFight not His coming with illusions, for it is His coming that you WANT above all\nthings that seem to glisten in the dream. The end of dreaming is the end of FEAR,\nand love was NEVER in the world of dreams.\n\nThe gap IS little. Yet it holds the seeds of pestilence and every form\nof ill, because it is a WISH to keep apart, and NOT to join. And thus it seems to\ngive a CAUSE to sickness which is NOT its cause. The PURPOSE of the gap is all\nthe cause that sickness has. For it was made to keep you separated in a body\nwhich you see as if it were the CAUSE of pain. The cause of pain is separation,\nNOT the body, which is only its EFFECT. Yet separation is but empty space,\nenclosing nothing, doing nothing, and as unsubstantial as the vacant place\nbetween the ripples that a ship has made in passing by. And covered just as fast,\nas water rushes in to close the gap, and as the waves, in joining, cover it.\n\nWhere is the gap BETWEEN the waves, when they have joined, and covered\nup the space which seemed to keep them separate for a little while?\nWhere is the grounds for sickness, when the minds have joined to close the gap\nBETWEEN them, where the seeds of sickness seemed to grow? God builds the bridge,\nbut only in the space left clean and vacant by the miracle. The weeds of sickness\nand the shame of sin He CANNOT bridge, for He cannot destroy the alien will that\nHe created not. Let its effects be gone, and clutch them not with eager hands, to\nkeep them for yourself. The miracle will brush them all aside, and thus make room\nfor Him Who wills to come, and bridge His Son's returning to Himself.\n\nCount, then, the silver miracles and golden dreams of happiness as all\nthe treasures you would keep within the storehouse of the world. The door is\nopen, NOT to thieves, but to your starving brothers, who mistook for gold a\nshining pebble, and who stored away a heap of snow that shone like silver. They\nhave nothing left behind the open door. What is the world except a little gap,\nperceived to tear eternity apart, and break it into days and months and years?\nAnd what are YOU who live within the world, except a picture of the Son of God in\nbroken pieces, each concealed within a separate and uncertain bit of clay?\n\nBe not afraid, but let your world be lit with miracles. And where the\ngap was seen to stand BETWEEN you, join your brother there. And sickness will be\nseen WITHOUT a cause. The dream of healing in forgiveness lies, and gently shows\nyou YOU have never sinned. The miracle would leave NO proof of guilt, to bring\nyou witness to what never WAS. And, in your storehouse, it will make a place of\nwelcome for your Father and your Self. The door is open, that all those may come\nwho would no longer starve, and would enjoy the feast of plenty set before them\nthere. And they will meet with your invited Guests the miracle has asked to come\nto you.\n\nThis is a feast unlike indeed to those the dreaming of the world has\nshown. For here, the more that anyone receives, the more is left for all the rest\nto share. The Guests have brought unlimited supply with Them. And no-one is\ndeprived, or can deprive. Here is a feast the Father lays before His Son, AND\nshares it equally with him. And in Their sharing there can BE no gap, in",

    "content": "The Greater Joining\n\nAccepting the Atonement for yourself means NOT to give support to\nsomeone's dream of sickness and of death. It means that you share NOT his wish to\nseparate, and let him turn illusions on himself. Nor do you wish that they be\nturned instead on YOU. Thus have they NO effects. And YOU are free of dreams of\npain because you let HIM be. UNLESS you help him, YOU will suffer pain with him\nbecause that is your wish. And you become a figure in HIS dream of pain, as he in\nYOURS. So do you BOTH become illusions, and without identity. You could be anyone\nor anything, depending on whose evil dream you share. You can be sure of just ONE\nthing; that you are evil, for you share in dreams of fear.\n\nThere is a way of finding certainty RIGHT HERE AND NOW. Refuse to be a\npart of fearful dreams, WHATEVER form they take. For you will lose identity in\nthem. You FIND yourself by NOT accepting them as causing you, and GIVING you\neffects. You stand apart from them, but NOT apart from him who dreams them. Thus\nyou separate the dreamer from the dream, and join with ONE, but let the OTHER go.\nThe dream is but illusion in the mind. And with the MIND you WOULD unite, but\nNEVER with the dream. It is the DREAM you fear, and NOT the mind. You see them as\nthe same, because you think that YOU are but a dream. And what is real and what\nis but illusion IN YOURSELF you do not know and cannot tell apart.\n\nLike you, your brother thinks HE is a dream. Share not in his illusion\nof himself. For YOUR identity depends on his reality. Think, rather, of him as a\nmind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He\nis not brother made by what he DREAMS, nor is his body, “hero” of the dream, your\nbrother. It is his REALITY that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind\nand his ARE joined in brotherhood. His body and his dreams but SEEM to make a\nlittle gap, where yours have joined with his. And yet, between your MINDS there\nIS no gap. To join his dreams is thus to meet him NOT, because his dreams would\nSEPARATE from you.\n\nTherefore release him, merely by your claim on brotherhood, and NOT on\ndreams of fear. Let him acknowledge who he IS, by not supporting his illusions by\nyour faith, for if you do, you will have faith in YOURS. With faith in yours, HE\nwill not be released, and YOU are kept in bondage to his dreams. And dreams of\nfear will haunt the little gap, inhabited but by illusions which you have\nSUPPORTED in each other's minds. Be certain, if you do YOUR part, he will do his,\nfor he will JOIN you where YOU stand. Call not to him to meet you in the gap\nBETWEEN you, or you MUST believe that it is YOUR reality, as well as his. You\nCANNOT do his part, but this you DO when you become a passive figure in his dream\nINSTEAD of dreamer of your own.\n\nIdentity in dreams is meaningless BECAUSE the dreamer and the dream\nare one. Who shares a dream must BE the dream he shares, because, BY sharing, is\na cause produced. You share confusion, and you ARE confused, for in the gap no\nstable self exists. What is the same seems different, because what IS the same\nappears to be unlike. His dreams are yours, because you LET them be. But, if you\ntook your OWN away, would he be free of them, and of his own as well. Your dreams\nare witnesses to his, and his attest the truth of yours. But if you see there IS\nno truth in yours, his dreams will disappear before his eyes, and he will\nunderstand what MADE the dream.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is in BOTH your minds, and He IS One, because there is\nno gap that separates His Oneness from Itself. The gap between your bodies\nmatters not, for what is joined in Him is ALWAYS one. No-one is sick, if someone\nELSE accepts his union WITH him. His desire to be a sick and separated mind can\nNOT remain without a witness or a cause. And both ARE gone, if someone wills to\nbe united with him. He has dreamed that he was separated from his brother, who,\nby sharing NOT his dream, has left the space between them vacant. And the Father\ncomes to join His Son the Holy Spirit joined.\n\nThe Holy Spirit's Function is to take the broken picture of the Son of\nGod, and put the pieces into place again. This holy picture, healed entirely,\ndoes He hold out to every separate piece that thinks it is a picture IN ITSELF.\nTo each he offers his identity, which the WHOLE picture represents, instead of\njust a little, broken bit, which he insisted was himself. And when he sees THIS\npicture, he will RECOGNIZE himself. If you share not your brother's evil dreams,\nthis IS the picture that the miracle will place within the little gap, left clean\nof all the seeds of sickness and of sin. And here the Father will receive His\nSon, because His Son was gracious to himself.\n\nI thank you, Father, knowing you will come to close each little gap\nthat lies between the broken pieces of Your holy Son. Your Holiness, complete and\nperfect, lies in every one of them. And they ARE joined, because what is in one\nIS in them all. How holy is the smallest grain of sand, when it is recognized as\nbeing part of the completed picture of God's Son. The forms the broken pieces\nseem to take mean nothing. For the Whole is in each one. And every aspect of the\nSon of God is just the same as every other part. Join not your brother's dream,\nbut join with HIM, and where you join His Son, the Father IS.\n\nWho seeks for substitutes, when he perceives HE HAS LOST NOTHING? Who\nwould WANT to have the “benefits” of sickness, when he has received the simple\nhappiness of health? What God has given cannot BE a loss, and what is not of Him\nhas NO effects. What, then, would you perceive within the gap? The seeds of\nsickness come from the belief that there is JOY in separation, and its giving up\nWOULD BE A SACRIFICE. But miracles are the result, when you do not insist on\nseeing in the gap what is not there. Your willingness to LET illusions go is all\nthe Healer of God's Son requires. He will place the miracle of healing where the\nseeds of sickness were. And there will be NO loss, but ONLY gain.",

    "content": "The Alternate to Dreams of Fear\n\nWhat is a sense of sickness but a sense of limitation? Of a splitting\nOFF and separating FROM? A gap perceived BETWEEN ourselves and what is seen as\nhealth? The good is seen OUTSIDE; the evil, IN. And thus is sickness separating\nOFF the self from good, and KEEPING evil there. God is the ALTERNATE to dreams of\nfear. Who shares in them can NEVER share in Him. But who WITHDRAWS his mind from\nsharing them IS sharing Him. There IS no other choice. Except you share it,\nNOTHING can exist, and YOU exist because God shared His Will with you, that His\ncreation might create.\n\nIt is the SHARING of the evil dreams, of hate and malice, bitterness\nand death, of sin and suffering, of pain and loss, that makes them real. UNSHARED\nthey are perceived as meaningless. The fear is gone from them BECAUSE YOU DID NOT\nGIVE THEM YOUR SUPPORT. Where fear has gone, there love MUST come, because there\nARE but these alternatives. Where one appears, the other DISappears. And which\nyou SHARE becomes the only one you HAVE. You HAVE the one which you accept,\nbecause it is the only one you WANT. You share NO evil dreams, if you forgive the\ndreamer, and perceive that he is NOT the dream he made. And so he CANNOT be a\npart of YOURS, from which you BOTH are free. Forgiveness SEPARATES the dreamer\nfrom the evil dream, and thus releases him.\n\nRemember if you SHARE an evil dream, you will believe you ARE the\ndream you share. And, fearing it, you will not WANT to know your own identity,\nbecause you think that IT is fearful. And you WILL deny your Self, and walk upon\nan alien ground which your Creator did not make, and where you seem to be a\n“something” you are not. You WILL make war upon your Self, Which SEEMS to be your\nenemy, and WILL attack your brother, as a part of what you hate. There is no\ncompromise. You are your Self, or an illusion. What CAN be between illusion and\nthe truth? A middle ground, where you can be a thing that is NOT you, MUST be a\ndream, and CANNOT be the truth.\n\nYou have conceived a little gap between illusions and the truth to be\nthe place where all your safety lies, and where your Self is safely hidden by\nwhat you have made. Here is a world established that is sick, and this the world\nthe body's eyes perceive. Here are the sounds it hears, the voices which its ears\nwere made to hear. Yet sights and sounds the body can perceive are meaningless.\nIt cannot see nor hear. It does not know what seeing IS; what listening is FOR.\nIt is as little able to perceive as it can judge, or understand, or know. Its\neyes are blind, its ears are deaf. It can NOT think, and so it cannot HAVE\neffects.\n\nWhat is there God created can be sick? And what that He created not\ncan BE? Let not your eyes behold a dream; your ears bear witness to illusion.\nThey were made to look upon a world that is not there; to hear the voices that\ncan make no sounds. Yet are there other sounds and other sights which can be seen\nand heard and UNDERSTOOD. For eyes and ears are senses without sense, and what\nthey see and hear they but report. It is not THEY that hear and see, but YOU, who\nPUT TOGETHER every jagged piece, each senseless scrap and shred of evidence, and\nMAKE a witness to the world you want.\n\nLet not the body's ears and eyes perceive these countless fragments\nseen within the gap that YOU imagined, and let THEM persuade their maker his\nimaginings were real. Creation proves reality because it SHARES the function ALL\ncreation shares. It is not made of little bits of glass, a piece of wood, a\nthread or two perhaps, and put together to ATTEST its truth. Reality does not\ndepend on THIS. There IS no gap which separates the truth from dreams and from\nillusions. Truth has left no room for them in ANY place or time. For It fills\nevery place and every time, and makes them wholly indivisible.\n\nYou who believe there is a little gap between you do not understand\nthat it is HERE that you are kept as prisoners in a world perceived to be\nEXISTING here. The world you see does not exist BECAUSE the place where you\nperceive it is not real. The gap is carefully concealed in fog, and misty\npictures rise to cover it with vague, uncertain forms and changing shapes,\nforever unsubstantial and unsure. Yet in the gap is NOTHING. And there ARE no\nawesome secrets and no darkened tombs where terror rises from the bones of death.\nLook at the little gap, and you behold the innocence and emptiness of sin that\nyou will see within yourself, when you have lost the fear of recognizing love.",

IT DOES NOT VICTIMIZE, because it has no will, no preferences, and NO\nDOUBTS. It does not wonder what it is. And so it has no NEED to be competitive.\nIt CAN be victimized, but CANNOT feel itself as victim. It accepts no role, but\ndoes what it is told, WITHOUT attack.\n\nIt is indeed a senseless point of view to hold responsible for sight a\nthing that cannot see, and blame it for the sounds you do not like, although it\ncannot hear. IT suffers not the punishment you give, because it HAS no feeling.\nIt behaves in ways you want, but NEVER makes the choice. It is not born and does\nnot die. It can but follow aimlessly the path on which it has been set. And if\nthat path is changed, it walks as easily another way. It takes no sides, and\njudges not the road it travels. It perceives no gap because IT DOES NOT HATE. It\ncan be USED for hate, but it cannot be hateful MADE thereby.\n\nThe thing you hate and fear and loathe and WANT, the body does not\nknow. You send it forth to SEEK for separation and BE separate. And THEN you hate\nit, NOT for what it is, but for the uses you have MADE of it. You shrink from\nwhat IT sees and what IT hears, and hate its frailty and its littleness. And you\ndespise its acts, but NOT your own. It sees and acts for YOU. It hears YOUR\nvoice. And it is frail and little by YOUR wish. It SEEMS to punish you, and thus\nDESERVE your hatred for the limitations which it brings to you.

This is the\nsecret oath you take again whenever you perceive yourself attacked. No-one can\nsuffer if he does NOT see himself attacked, AND LOSING BY ATTACK. Unstated and\nunheard in consciousness is every pledge to sickness. Yet it is a promise to\nanother to be hurt by him, and to attack him in return.\n\nSickness is anger taken out upon the body, so that IT will suffer\npain. It is the obvious effect of what was made in secret, IN AGREEMENT with\nanother's secret wish to be apart from you, as you would be apart from him.\nUnless you BOTH agree this is your wish, it CAN have no effects. Whoever says,\n“There IS no gap between my mind and yours,” has kept GOD'S promise, NOT his tiny\noath to be forever faithful unto death. And by his healing IS his brother healed.\nLet THIS be your agreement with each one; that you be one with him and NOT apart.\nAnd he will keep the promise that you make with him, because it is the one which\nhe has made to God, as God has made to him.\n\nGod keeps His promises; His Son keeps his.

And it is\nonly there that he could want for something he has not. A space where God is not,\na gap between the Father and the Son is NOT the Will of either, who have promised\nto be One. God's promise is a promise to HIMSELF, and there is no-one who could\nBE untrue to what He wills as part of what He IS. The promise that there IS no\ngap between Himself and what He is cannot BE false. What will can come between\nwhat MUST be One, and in Whose Wholeness there can BE no gaps?\n\nThe beautiful relationship you have with all your brothers is a part\nof you BECAUSE it is a part of God Himself. Are you not sick if you deny yourself\nyour wholeness and your health, the Source of help, the call to healing and the\nCall to heal? Your Savior waits for healing, and the world waits with him. Nor\nare YOU apart from it. For healing will be one, or not at all, its oneness being\nwhere the healing LIES. What could CORRECT for separation but its opposite? There\nis no middle ground, in ANY aspect of salvation. You accept it wholly, or accept\nit not. What is unseparated must be JOINED. And what is joined cannot BE\nseparate.\n\nEither there IS a gap between you and your brother, or you ARE as one.\nThere is no in between, no other choice, and no allegiance to be split BETWEEN\nthe two. A split allegiance is but faithlessness to both, and merely sets you\nspinning round, to grasp uncertainly at any straw that seems to hold some promise\nof relief. Yet who can build his home upon a straw, and count on it as shelter\nfrom the wind? The body can be made a home like this BECAUSE it lacks foundation\nin the truth. And yet, BECAUSE it does, it can be seen as NOT your home, but\nmerely as an aid to help you reach the home where God abides.\n\nWith THIS as purpose IS the body healed. It is NOT used to witness to\nthe dream of separation and disease. Nor is it idly blamed for what it did not\ndo. It serves to help the HEALING of God's Son, and, for THIS purpose, it cannot\nBE sick. It will not join a purpose not your own, and you have chosen that it NOT\nbe sick. All miracles are based upon this choice, and GIVEN you the instant it is\nmade. No forms of sickness are immune, because the choice cannot be MADE in terms\nof form. The choice of SICKNESS seems to be a form, yet it is one, as is its\nopposite. And YOU are sick or well, accordingly.\n\nBut NEVER you alone. This world is but the dream that you can BE\nalone, and think without affecting those apart from you. To be alone MUST mean\nyou are apart, and if you are, you cannot BUT be sick. This SEEMS to prove that\nyou must be APART. Yet all it means is that you tried to keep a promise to be\ntrue to faithlessness. Yet faithlessness IS sickness. It is like the house upon a\nstraw. It SEEMS to be quite solid and substantial IN ITSELF. But its stability\ncannot be judged APART from its foundation. If it rests on straws, there is no\nneed to bar the door and lock the windows, and make fast the bolts. The wind WILL\ntopple it, and rain WILL come, and carry it into oblivion.\n\nWhat is the SENSE in seeking to be safe in what was MADE for danger\nand for fear? Why burden it with further locks and chains and heavy anchors, when\nits weakness lies, NOT in itself, but in the frailty of the little gap of\nnothingness whereon it stands? What CAN be safe which rests upon a shadow? Would\nyou build your home upon what WILL collapse beneath a feather's weight? Your home\nis built upon your brother's health; upon his happiness, his sinlessness, and\neverything his Father promised him. No secret promise you have made INSTEAD has\nshaken the Foundation of his home.\n\nThe winds will blow upon it and the rain will beat against it, but\nwith NO effect. The world will wash away, and yet this house will stand forever,\nfor its strength lies NOT within itself alone. It is an ark of safety, resting on\nGod's promise, that His Son is safe forever in Himself. What gap can interpose\nitself between the safety of this shelter and its Source? From here, the body can\nbe seen as what it is, and neither less nor more in worth than the extent to\nwhich it can be used to liberate God's Son unto his home. And, with this holy\npurpose, is it made a home of holiness a little while, because it shares your\nFather's Will with You.",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nThere is no time, no place, no state where God is absent. There is\nNOTHING to be feared. There is no way in which a gap could be conceived of in the\nWholeness that is His. The compromise the least and littlest gap would represent\nin His eternal Love is quite impossible. For it would mean His Love could harbor\njust a hint of hate; His gentleness turn sometimes to attack; and His eternal\npatience sometimes fail. All this do you BELIEVE, when you perceive a gap between\nyour brother and yourself. How could you trust Him, then? For He must be\ndeceptive in His Love. Be wary, then; let Him not come too close, and leave a gap\nbetween you and His Love, through which you can escape if there be need for you\nto flee.\n\nHere is the fear of God most plainly seen. For love is treacherous to\nthose who fear, since fear and hate can NEVER be apart. No-one who hates but is\nafraid of love, and therefore MUST he be afraid of God. Certain it is he knows\nnot what love MEANS. He fears to love and loves to hate, and so he thinks that\nlove is fearful; hate is love. This is the consequence the little gap MUST bring\nto those who cherish it, and think that it is their salvation and their hope. The\nfear of God! -- the greatest obstacle that peace must flow across has not yet\ngone. The rest are past, but this one still remains to block your path, and make\nthe way to light seem dark and fearful, perilous and bleak.\n\nYou had DECIDED that your brother is your enemy. SOMETIMES a friend,\nperhaps, provided that your separate interests made your friendship possible a\nlittle while. But NOT without a gap between you, lest he turn again into an\nenemy. Let him come close to you, and you jumped back; as you approached, he\ninstantly withdrew. A cautious friendship, limited in scope and carefully\nrestricted in amount, became the treaty you had made with him. You shared a\nqualified entente, in which a clause of separation was a point on which you both\nagreed to keep intact. And violating this was thought to be a breach of treaty\nnot to be allowed.",

    "content": "The Closing of the Gap\n\nThe gap between you is NOT one of space between two separate bodies.\nThis but SEEMS to be dividing off your separate minds. It is the SYMBOL of a\npromise, made to meet when you prefer, and separate until you both elect to meet\nagain. And then your bodies seem to get in touch, and signify a meeting place to\njoin. But always is it possible to go your separate ways. Conditional upon the\nright to separate will you agree to meet from time to time, and keep apart in\nintervals of separation, which protect you from the “sacrifice” of love. THE BODY\nSAVES YOU, for it gets away from total “sacrifice,” and gives you time in which\nto build again your separate selves, which you believe DIMINISH as you meet.\n\nThe body COULD not separate your minds, unless you WANTED it to be a\ncause of separation and of distance seen between you. Thus do you ENDOW it with\na power that lies NOT within itself. And herein lies its power over you. For now\nyou think that IT determines when you meet, and limits your ability to make\ncommunion with each other's mind. And now it TELLS you where to go, and how to go\nthere; what is feasible for you to undertake, and what you CANNOT do. It dictates\nwhat its health can tolerate, and what will tire it and make it sick. And its\n“inherent” weaknesses set up the limitations on what YOU would do, and keep your\nPURPOSE limited and weak.\n\nThe body WILL accommodate to this, if you would have it so. It WILL\nallow but limited indulgences in “love,” with intervals of hatred in between. And\nit WILL take command of when to “love,” and when to shrink more safely into fear.\nIt will be sick BECAUSE you do not know what loving means. And so you MUST misuse\neach circumstance and everyone you meet, and see in them a purpose NOT their own.\nIt is not love that asks a sacrifice. But fear DEMANDS the sacrifice of love,\nfor in love's presence fear cannot abide. For hate to be maintained love MUST be\nfeared, and only SOMETIMES present; SOMETIMES gone.\n\nThus is love seen as treacherous, because IT seems to come and go\nuncertainly, and offer no stability to you. You do NOT see how limited and weak\nis YOUR allegiance, and how frequently you have demanded that it go away, and\nleave you quietly alone in “peace.” The body, innocent of ANY goal, is your\nexcuse for variable goals YOU hold, and force the body to maintain. You do not\nfear its weakness, but its lack of strength OR weakness. Would you recognize that\nNOTHING stands between you? Would you know there IS no gap behind which you can\nhide?\n\nThere IS a shock that comes to those who learn their Savior is their\nenemy no more. There IS a wariness that is aroused by learning that the body is\nnot real. And there ARE overtones of seeming fear around the happy message “God\nis Love.” Yet all that happens when the gap is gone is peace eternal. Nothing\nMORE than that, and nothing less. Without the fear of God, what could induce you\nto abandon Him? What toys or trinkets in the gap could serve to hold you back an\ninstant from His Love? Would you ALLOW the body to say “No” to Heaven's calling,\nwere you not afraid to find a LOSS of self in finding God? And CAN your Self be\nlost by being found?",

    "content": "The Coming of the Guest\n\nWhy would you not perceive it as RELEASE from suffering to learn that\nyou are free? Why would you not ACCLAIM the truth, instead of looking on it as an\nenemy? Why does an EASY path, so clearly marked it is impossible to lose the way\nseem thorny, rough, and far too difficult for you to follow? Is it not because\nyou see it as the road to hell, instead of looking on it as a simple way, without\na sacrifice or ANY loss, to find yourself in Heaven and in God? Until you realize\nyou give up NOTHING; until you understand there IS no loss; you will have some\nregrets about the way that you have chosen. And you will NOT see the many gains\nyour choice has offered you.\n\nYet, though you do not see them, they are there. Their CAUSE has been\neffected, and they MUST be present were their cause has entered in. You have\naccepted healing's Cause, and so it MUST be you are healed. And, being healed,\nthe power to heal must ALSO now be yours. The miracle is not a separate thing\nthat happens suddenly, as an effect without a cause, nor is it, in itself, a\ncause. But where its Cause is MUST it be. Now IS it caused, though not as yet\nperceived. And its effects are THERE, though not yet seen. Look inward now, and\nyou will not behold a reason for regret, but cause indeed for glad rejoicing and\nfor hope of peace.\n\nIt HAS been hopeless to attempt to find the hope of peace upon a\nbattleground. It HAS been futile to demand escape from sin and pain of what was\nmade to serve the function of RETAINING sin and pain. For pain and sin are ONE\nillusion, as are hate and fear, attack and guilt but one. Where they are\ncauseless, their effects ARE gone, and love MUST come wherever they are not. Why\nare you not rejoicing? You ARE free of pain and sickness, misery and loss, and\nALL effects of hatred and attack. No more is pain your friend and guilt your god,\nand you should WELCOME the effects of love.\n\nYour Guest HAS come. You asked Him and He came. You did not hear Him\nenter, for you did not wholly welcome Him. And yet His gifts came with Him. He\nhas laid them at your feet, and asks you now that you will look on them, and take\nthem for your own. He NEEDS your help in giving them to all who walk apart,\nbelieving they are separate and alone. They WILL be healed when you accept your\ngifts, because your Guest will welcome everyone whose feet have touched the holy\nground whereon you stand, and where His gifts for them are laid.\n\nYou do not see how much you now can GIVE, because of everything you\nhave received. Yet He Who entered in but waits for YOU to come where you invited\nHIM to be. There is no other place where He can find His host, nor where His host\ncan meet with Him. And nowhere else His gifts of peace and joy, and all the\nhappiness His Presence brings can be obtained. For they are where He is that\nbrought them with Him, that they might be yours. You can not see your Guest,\nbut you CAN see the gifts He brought. And when you LOOK on them, you will believe\nHis Presence MUST be there. For what you now can do could not BE done without the\nlove and grace His Presence holds.\n\nSuch is the promise of the living God; His Son have life, and every\nliving thing is part of him, and nothing else has life. What YOU have “given”\nlife is NOT alive, and symbolizes but your wish to be alive APART from life,\nalive in death, with death perceived as life, and living, death. Confusion\nfollows on confusion here, for ON confusion has this world been based, and there\nis nothing else it rests upon. Its basis does not change, although it SEEMS to be\nin constant change. But what is that except the state confusion really MEANS?\nStability to those who are confused is meaningless. And shift and change become\nthe law on which they predicate their lives.\n\nThe body does not change. It represents the larger dream that change\nis POSSIBLE. To change is to attain a state unlike the one in which you found\nyourself before. There IS no change in immortality, and Heaven knows it not. Yet\nhere on earth, it has a double purpose, for it can be made to teach opposing\nthings. And they reflect the teacher who is teaching them. The body can APPEAR to\nchange with time, with sickness or with health, and with events that seem to\nalter it. And this but means the mind remains unchanged in its belief of what the\nPURPOSE of the body is.\n\nSickness is a demand the body be a thing that it is not. Its\nNOTHINGNESS is guarantee that it can NOT be sick. In your demand that it be\nMORE than this lies the idea of sickness. For it asks that God be LESS than all\nHe really is. What, then, becomes of YOU, for it IS you of whom the sacrifice is\nasked? For He is told that part of him BELONGS to Him no longer. He must\nsacrifice your self, and in His sacrifice are YOU made more, and He is lessened\nby the loss of you. And what is GONE from Him becomes your god, PROTECTING you\nfrom being part of Him.\n\nThe body that is asked to be a god WILL be attacked, because its\nnothingness has not been recognized. And so it seems to be a thing with power IN\nITSELF. As something, it CAN be perceived, and thought to feel and act, and hold\nyou in its grasp as prisoner to itself. And it CAN fail to be what you demanded\nit to be. And you WILL hate it for its littleness, unmindful that the failure\ndoes not lie in that it is not MORE than it should be, but ONLY in YOUR failure\nto perceive that it is nothing. Yet its nothingness IS your salvation, from which\nyou would flee.\n\nAs something, is the body asked to be God's enemy, replacing what He\nis with littleness and limit and despair. It is HIS loss you celebrate when you\nbehold the body as a thing you love, or look upon it as a thing you hate. For if\nHe be the sum of everything, then what is NOT in Him does not exist. And His\ncompletion IS its nothingness. Your Savior is NOT dead, nor does he dwell in\nwhat was built as temple unto death. He lives in God, and it is this that makes\nhim Savior unto YOU, and ONLY this. His body's nothingness releases yours from\nsickness and from death. For what is yours cannot be more NOR less than what is\nhis.",

For who is Savior, but the one who GIVES salvation? Thus he learns\nit must be his to give. UNLESS he gives, he will not know he HAS, for giving is\nthe proof of having. Only those who think that God is lessened by their strength\ncould fail to understand this must be so. For who COULD give unless he has, and\nwho could lose by giving what must be INCREASED thereby?\n\nThink you the Father LOST Himself when He created you? Was HE made\nweak because He shared His Love? Was He made incomplete by YOUR perfection? Or\nare you the proof that He IS perfect and complete? Deny Him not His witness in\nthe dream His Son prefers to his reality. He must be Savior FROM the dream he\nmade, that he be free of it. He must see someone ELSE as NOT a body, one with\nhim, without the wall the world has built to keep apart all living things who\nknow not that they live. Within the dream of bodies and of death, is yet one\ntheme of truth. No more, perhaps, than just a tiny spark, a space of light\ncreated in the dark, where God shines still.\n\nYou cannot wake yourself. But you can LET yourself be wakened. You can\noverlook your brother's dreams. So perfectly can you forgive him his illusions,\nhe becomes your Savior from YOUR dreams. And as you see him shining in the space\nof light where God abides within the darkness, you will see that God Himself is\nwhere his body is. Before this light the body disappears, as heavy shadows MUST\ngive way to light. The darkness cannot CHOOSE that it remain. The coming of the\nlight MEANS it is gone. In glory will you see your brother then, and understand\nwhat REALLY fills the gap so long perceived as keeping you apart.\n\nThere, in its place, God's Witness has set forth the gentle way of\nkindness to God's Son. Whom you forgive is GIVEN power to forgive you your\nillusions. By your gift of freedom is it given unto YOU. Make way for love which\nyou did not create, but which you CAN extend. On earth this means forgive your\nbrother, that the darkness may be lifted from YOUR mind. When light has come to\nhim through your forgiveness, he will not forget his Savior, leaving him unsaved.\nFor it was in YOUR face he saw the light that he would keep beside him, as he\nwalks through darkness to the everlasting Light.\n\nHow holy are you, that the Son of God can be your Savior in the midst\nof dreams of desolation and disaster. See how eagerly he comes, and steps aside\nfrom heavy shadows that have hidden him, and shines on you in gratitude and\nlove. He is himself, but not himself alone. And as his Father lost not part of\nHim in your creation, so the light in him is brighter still, because you gave\nyour light to him, to save him from the dark. And now the light in you must be as\nbright as shines in him. This is the spark that shines within the dream; that you\ncan help him waken, and be sure his waking eyes will rest upon you first, and in\nhis glad salvation YOU are saved.",

    "content": "Dream Roles\n\nDo you believe that truth can be but SOME illusions? They are dreams\nBECAUSE they are not true. Their EQUAL lack of truth becomes the basis for the\nmiracle, which MEANS that you have understood that dreams are dreams, and that\nescape depends, NOT on the dream, but ONLY on awaking. COULD it be some dreams\nare KEPT, and others WAKENED FROM? The choice is NOT between which dreams to\nkeep, but ONLY if you want to live in dreams, or to awaken from them. Thus it is\nthe miracle does not select SOME dreams to leave untouched by its beneficence.\nYou cannot dream some dreams and wake from some. For you are either sleeping OR\nawake. And dreaming goes with only ONE of these.\n\nThe dreams you THINK you like would hold you back, as much as those in\nwhich the fear is seen. For EVERY dream is but a dream of fear, no matter what\nthe form it seems to take. The fear is seen within, without, or both. Or it can\nbe disguised in pleasant form. But never is it ABSENT from the dream. For fear is\nthe material of dreams, from which they ALL are made. Their form can change, but\nthey cannot be MADE of something else. The miracle were treacherous indeed if it\nallowed you still to be afraid, because you did not RECOGNIZE the fear. You would\nnot then be WILLING to awake, for which the miracle prepares the way.\n\nIn simplest form, it can be said attack is a response to function\nunfulfilled AS YOU PERCEIVE THE FUNCTION. It can be in you or someone else, but\nwhere it is perceived, it will be there it is attacked. Depression or assault\nmust be the theme of every dream, for they are made of fear. The thin disguise of\npleasure and of joy in which they may be wrapped but slightly veils the heavy\nlump of fear which is their core. And it is THIS the miracle perceives, and NOT\nthe wrappings in which it is bound. When you are angry, is it not because someone\nhas failed to fill the function YOU allotted him? And does not THIS become the\n“reason” your attack is justified?\n\nThe dreams you THINK you like are those in which the functions YOU\nhave given have been filled; the needs which YOU ascribe to you are met. It does\nnot matter if they be fulfilled, or merely wanted. It is the idea that they EXIST\nfrom which the fears arise. Dreams are not wanted more or less. They are desired\nor not. And each one represents some function which you have assigned; some goal\nwhich an event, or body, or a thing SHOULD represent, and SHOULD achieve for you.\nIf it succeeds, you think you LIKE the dream. If it should fail, you think the\ndream is sad. But whether it succeeds or fails is not its core, but just the\nflimsy covering.\n\nHow happy would your dreams become, if you were NOT the one who gave\nthe “proper” role to every figure that the dream contains. No-one can fail but\nyour IDEA of him, and there IS no betrayal but of this. The core of dreams the\nHoly Spirit gives is NEVER one of fear. The coverings may not appear to change,\nbut what they MEAN has changed BECAUSE they cover something else. Perceptions are\ndetermined by their purpose, in that they seem to BE what they are FOR. A shadow\nfigure who attacks becomes a brother giving you a chance to help, if this becomes\nthe FUNCTION of the dream. And dreams of sadness thus are turned to joy.\n\nWhat is your brother FOR? You do not know, because YOUR function is\nobscure to you. Do NOT ascribe a role to him which you imagine would bring\nhappiness to you. And do not try to hurt him, when he fails to take the part\nwhich you assigned to him in what you dream your life was meant to be. He asks\nfor help in every dream he has, and you have Help to give him if you see the\nFUNCTION of the dream as He perceives its function, Who can utilize all dreams as\nmeans to serve the Function given Him. Because He loves the dreamer, NOT the\ndream, each dream becomes an offering of love. For at its center is His Love for\nyou, which lights WHATEVER form it takes with love.",

There is a place in you\nwhich time has left, and echoes of eternity are heard. There is a resting place\nso still no sound except a hymn to Heaven rises up to gladden God the Father and\nthe Son. Where Both abide are They remembered Both. And where They are is Heaven\nand is peace. Think not that you can change Their dwelling place. For your\nIdentity abides in Them, and where They are, forever must YOU be.\n\nThe changelessness of Heaven is in you, so deep within that nothing in\nthis world but passes by, unnoticed and unseen. The still infinity of endless\npeace surrounds you gently in its soft embrace, so strong and quiet, tranquil in\nthe might of its Creator, nothing can intrude upon the sacred Son of God within.\nHere is the role the Holy Spirit gives to you who wait upon the Son of God, and\nwould behold him waken and be glad: He is a part of you, and you of him,\nBECAUSE he is his Father's Son, and not for ANY purpose you may see in him.\nNothing is asked of you but to ACCEPT the Changeless and Eternal that abide in\nhim, for YOUR Identity is there.\n\nThe peace in you CAN but be found in him. And every thought of love\nyou offer him but brings you nearer to your wakening to peace eternal and to\nendless joy. This sacred Son of God is like yourself; the mirror of his Father's\nLove for you, the soft reminder of his Father's Love by which he was created, and\nwhich still abides in him, as It abides in you. Be very still, and hear God's\nVoice in him, and let It tell you what his function is. He was created that YOU\nmight be whole, for only the complete can be a part of God's Completion, Which\ncreated you.\n\nThere is no gift the Father asks of you but that you see in all\ncreation but the shining glory of His Gift to you. Behold His Son, His perfect\ngift, in whom his Father shines forever, and to whom is all creation given as his\nown.\nBECAUSE he has it is it given you, and where it lies in him behold YOUR peace.\nThe quiet that surrounds you dwells in him, and FROM this quiet come the happy\ndreams in which your hands are joined in innocence. These are not hands that\ngrasp in dreams of pain. They hold no sword, for they have left their hold on\nevery vain illusion of the world. And, being empty, they received instead a\nbrother's hand in which completeness lay.\n\nIf you but knew the glorious goal that lies beyond forgiveness, you\nwould not keep hold on any thought, however light the touch of evil on it may\nappear to be. For you would understand how great the cost of holding anything God\ndid not give in minds that can direct the hand to bless, and lead God's Son unto\nHis Father's house. Would you not WANT to be a friend to him, created by his\nFather as His home? If God esteems him worthy of Himself, would YOU attack him\nwith the hands of hate? Who would lay bloody hands on Heaven itself, and hope to\nfind its peace? Your brother thinks he holds the hand of death. Believe him not.\nBut learn, instead, how blessed are you who can release him, just by offering him\nyours.\n\nA dream is given you in which he is your Savior, NOT your enemy in\nhate. A dream is given you in which you have forgiven him for all his dreams of\ndeath; a dream of hope you SHARE with him, instead of dreaming evil separate\ndreams of hate. Why does it seem so hard to share this dream? Because, unless the\nHoly Spirit gives the dream its function, it was made for hate, and will continue\nin death's services. Each form it takes in some way calls for death. And those\nwho serve the lord of death have come to worship in a separated world, each with\nhis tiny spear and rusted sword, to keep his ancient promises to die.\n\nSuch is the core of fear in every dream that has been kept apart from\nuse by Him Who sees a different function for a dream. When dreams are SHARED,\nthey lose the function of attack and separation, even though it was for this that\nevery dream was made. Yet nothing in the world of dreams remains without the hope\nof change and betterment, for here is NOT where changelessness is found. Let us\nbe glad indeed that this is so, and seek not the eternal in this world. Forgiving\ndreams are means to step aside from dreaming of a world OUTSIDE yourself.

These questions are the\nsame, in different form. Forgiveness IS your peace, for herein lies the end of\nseparation, and the dream of danger and destruction, sin and death; of madness\nand of murder, grief and loss. This is the “sacrifice” salvation asks, and gladly\noffers peace INSTEAD of this. Swear not to die, thou holy Son of God! You make a\nbargain that you cannot keep. The Son of Life cannot BE killed. He is immortal as\nhis Father. What he is cannot be changed. He is the only thing in all the\nuniverse that MUST be One.\n\nWhat SEEMS eternal all will have an end. The stars will disappear, and\nnight and day will be no more. All things that come and go, the tides, the\nseasons, and the lives of man; all things that change with time and bloom and\nfade, will not return. Where time has set an end is not where the Eternal is.\nGod's Son can never change by what men made of him. He will be as he was, and as\nhe is, for time appointed not his destiny, nor sets the hour of his birth and\ndeath. Forgiveness will not change him. But time waits upon forgiveness, that the\nthings of time may disappear because they have no use.\n\nNothing survives its purpose. If it be conceived to die, then die it\nmust, unless it does not take this purpose as its own. Change is the only thing\nthat can be made a blessing here, where purpose is NOT fixed, however changeless\nit APPEARS to be. Think not that YOU can set a goal unlike God's Purpose FOR you,\nand establish it as changeless and eternal. You CAN give yourself a purpose that\nyou do not have. But you can NOT remove the Power to change your mind, and see\nANOTHER purpose there. Change is the gift of God He gave to all that YOU would\nmake eternal, to ensure that ONLY Heaven would not pass away.\n\nYou were NOT born to die. You CANNOT change, because your Function HAS\nbeen fixed by God. All other goals are set in time, and change that time might be\npreserved, EXCEPTING ONE. Forgiveness does not aim at KEEPING time, but at its\nending, when it has no use. Its purpose ended, it is gone. And where it once held\nseeming sway is now restored the Function God established for His Son in full\nawareness. Time can set no end to Its fulfillment, nor Its changelessness. There\nis no death, because the living share the Function their Creator gave to them.\nLife's function CANNOT be to die. It must be life's EXTENSION, that it be as One\nforever and forever, WITHOUT end.\n\nThis world will bind your feet and tie your hands and kill your body,\nONLY if you think that it was made to crucify God's Son. For even though it WAS a\ndream of death, you need not let it stand for this to you. Let THIS be changed,\nand nothing in the world but MUST be changed as well. For nothing here but is\ndefined as what you see it FOR. How lovely is the world whose purpose is\nforgiveness of God's Son! How free from fear, how filled with blessing and with\nhappiness! And what a joyous thing it is to dwell a little while in such a happy\nplace! Nor CAN it be forgot, in such a world, it IS a little while 'til\ntimelessness comes quietly to take the place of time.",

Heaven cannot be found where it is not, and there can be no\npeace EXCEPTING there. Each idol that you worship when God calls will never\nanswer in His place. There IS no other answer you can substitute, and find the\nhappiness His Answer brings. Seek not outside yourself. For all your pain comes\nsimply from a futile search for what you want, insisting WHERE it must be found.\nWhat if it is not there? Do you prefer that you be right or happy? Be you glad\nthat you are told where happiness abides, and seek no longer elsewhere. You\nwill fail.\n\nBut it is given you to know the truth, and NOT to seek for it outside\nyourself. No-one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering\nillusion, or some dream that there is something OUTSIDE of himself that will\nbring happiness and peace to him. If everything is IN him, this can not be so.\nAnd therefore, BY his coming, he denies the truth about himself, and seeks for\nsomething MORE than everything, as if a part of it were separated off, and found\nwhere all the REST of it is NOT. This is the purpose he bestows upon the body;\nthat it seek for what he lacks, and GIVE him what would make himself complete.\n\nAnd thus he wanders aimlessly about, in search of something that he\ncannot find, believing him to be what he is not. The lingering illusion will\nimpel him to seek out a thousand idols, and to seek beyond them for a thousand\nmore. And each will fail him, all excepting one; for he will die, and does not\nunderstand the idol that he seeks IS but his death. Its FORM appears to be\noutside himself. Yet does he seek to kill God's Son within, and PROVE that he is\nvictor over him. This is the purpose EVERY idol has, for this the role that is\nassigned to it, and this the role that cannot BE fulfilled.\n\nWhenever you attempt to reach a goal in which the body's betterment is\ncast as major beneficiary, you try to bring about your death. For you believe\nthat you can suffer lack, and lack IS death. To sacrifice is to GIVE UP, and thus\nto be without, and to have suffered loss. And, BY this giving up is life\nrenounced. Seek not outside yourself. The search implies you are not whole\nwithin, and fear to look upon your devastation, and prefer to seek outside\nyourself for what you are. Idols must fall BECAUSE they have no life, and what is\nlifeless IS a sign of death. You came to die, and what would you expect, but to\nPERCEIVE the signs of death you seek?\n\nNo sadness and no suffering proclaims a message OTHER than an idol\nfound, which represents a parody of life which, in its lifelessness, is really\ndeath, conceived as real and given living form. Yet each must fail and crumble\nand decay, because a form of death can not BE life, and what is sacrificed can\nnot BE whole. All idols of this world were made to keep the truth within from\nbeing known to you, and to maintain allegiance to the dream that you must find\nwhat is OUTSIDE of you to be complete and happy. It is vain to worship idols in\nthe hope of peace. God dwells within, and your completion lies in Him. No idol\ntakes His place. Look not to idols. Do not seek outside yourself.\n\nLet us forget the purpose of the world the past has given it. For\notherwise, the future WILL be like the past, and but a series of depressing\ndreams, in which all idols fail you, one by one, and you see death and\ndisappointment everywhere. To change all this, and open up a road of hope and of\nrelease in what appeared to be an endless circle of despair, you need but to\ndecide you do not KNOW the purpose of the world. You GIVE it goals it does not\nhave, and thus do YOU decide what it is for. You try to see in it a place of\nidols, found outside yourself, with power to make complete what is within by\nsplitting what you are BETWEEN the two.\n\nYou CHOOSE your dreams, for they are what you wish, perceived AS IF it\nhad been given you. And idols do what you would have them do, and HAVE the power\nyou ascribe to them. And you pursue them vainly in the dream, because you want\ntheir power as your own. Yet where ARE dreams, but in a mind asleep? And CAN a\ndream succeed in making real the pictures it projects outside itself? Save time,\nmy brothers! Learn what time is FOR. And speed the end of idols in the world\nmade sad and sick by seeing idols there. Your holy minds are altars unto God, and\nwhere He is NO idols can abide.\n\nThe fear of God is but the fear of loss of idols. It is NOT the fear\nof loss of your reality. But YOU have made of your reality an idol, which you\nmust protect AGAINST the light of truth. And all the world becomes the means by\nwhich this idol can be saved. Salvation thus appears to THREATEN life, and offer\ndeath. It is not so. Salvation seeks to prove there IS no death, and ONLY life\nexists. The sacrifice of death is NOTHING lost. An idol CANNOT take the place of\nGod. Let Him remind you of His Love for you, and do not seek to drown His Voice\nin chants of deep despair to idols of yourself. Seek not outside your Father for\nyour hope. For hope of happiness is NOT despair.",

    "content": "Christ and Anti-Christ\n\nWhat is an idol? Do you think you know? For idols are unrecognized as\nsuch, and never seen for what they really are. That is the only power which they\nhave. Their purpose is obscure, and they are feared, and worshipped, both,\nBECAUSE you do not know what they are for, and why they have been made. An idol\nis an image of your brother, which you would value MORE than what he IS. Idols\nare made that HE may be replaced, no matter what their form. And it is this which\nNEVER is perceived and recognized. Be it a body or a thing, a place, a situation\nor a circumstance, an object owned or wanted, or a right demanded or achieved, it\nis the same.\n\nLet not their form deceive you. Idols are but substitutes for your\nreality. In some way you believe they will complete your little self, and let you\nwalk in safety in a world perceived as dangerous, with forces massed against your\nconfidence and peace of mind. They have the power to supply your lacks, and add\nthe value which you do not have. No-one believes in idols who has not enslaved\nhimself to littleness and loss. And thus must seek BEYOND his little self for\nstrength to raise his head and stand apart from all the misery the world\nreflects. This is the penalty for looking not within for certainty, and for a\nquiet calm which liberates you FROM the world, and lets you stand apart in quiet\nand in peace unlimited.\n\nAn idol is a false impression, or a false belief; some form of anti-\nChrist which constitutes a gap BETWEEN the Christ and what you see. An idol is a\nwish, made tangible and given form, and thus perceived as real, and seen OUTSIDE\nthe mind. Yet they remain ideas, and CANNOT leave the mind that is their source.\nNor is their form apart from the idea it represents. All forms of anti-Christ\noppose the Christ. And fall before His Face like a dark veil which SEEMS to shut\nyou off from Him, alone in darkness. Yet the light is there. A cloud does not put\nout the sun. No more a veil can banish what it seems to separate, nor darken by\none whit the Light Itself.\n\nThis world of idols IS a veil across the Face of Christ BECAUSE its\npurpose is to separate your brother from yourself. A dark and fearful purpose,\nyet a thought without the power to change one blade of grass from something\nliving to a sign of death. Its form is nowhere, for its source abides within your\nmind where God abideth not. Where IS this place, where What is everywhere has\nbeen excluded, and been kept apart? What hand could be held up to block God's\nway; whose voice could make demands He enter not? The “more-than-everything” is\nNOT a thing to make you tremble and to quail in fear. Christ's enemy is nowhere.\nHe can take NO form in which he EVER will be real.\n\nWhat is an idol? Nothing! It must be believed BEFORE it seems to come\nto life, and GIVEN power that it may be feared. Its life and power are its\nbeliever's gift, and this is what the miracle restores to what HAS life and power\nworthy of the gift of Heaven and eternal peace. The miracle does not restore the\ntruth, the light the veil between has NOT put out. It merely LIFTS the veil, and\nLETS the truth shine unencumbered, being what It is. It does not NEED belief to\nbe Itself, for It HAS BEEN created, so It IS. An idol is ESTABLISHED by belief,\nand when it is withdrawn, the idol “dies.”\n\nThis is the anti-Christ; the strange idea there is a power PAST\nomnipotence, a place BEYOND the infinite, a time transcending the eternal. Here\nthe world of idols has been set by the idea this power and place and time are\ngiven form, and shape the world where the impossible has happened. Here the\ndeathless come to die; the all-encompassing to suffer loss; the timeless to be\nmade the slaves of time. Here does the changeless change; the peace of God,\nforever given to all living things, give way to chaos. And the Son of God, as\nperfect, sinless, and as loving as his Father, come to hate a little while; to\nsuffer pain, and finally to die.\n\nWHERE is an idol? Nowhere! Can there be a gap in what is infinite, a\nplace where time can INTERRUPT eternity? A place of darkness set where all is\nlight, a dismal alcove separated off from what is endless, HAS no place to be. An\nidol is beyond where God has set all things forever, and has left no room for\nanything EXCEPT His Will to be. Nothing and nowhere MUST an idol be, while God is\neverything and everywhere. What purpose has an idol, then? What is it FOR? This\nis the only question which has many answers, each depending on the one of whom\nthe question has been asked.\n\nThe world BELIEVES in idols. No-one comes unless he worshipped them,\nand still attempts to seek for one that yet might offer him a gift reality does\nNOT contain. Each worshipper of idols harbors hope his SPECIAL deities will give\nhim MORE than other men possess. It MUST be “more.” It does not really matter\nmore of what, - more beauty, more intelligence, more wealth; or even more\naffliction and more pain. But MORE of SOMETHING is an idol FOR. And when one\nfails another takes its place, with hope of finding more of something ELSE. Be\nnot deceived by forms the “something” takes. An idol is a means for getting MORE.\nAnd it is THIS that is against God's Will.\n\nGod has not many sons, but only One. Who can have more, and who be\ngiven less? In Heaven would the Son of God but laugh, if idols could intrude upon\nhis peace. It is for HIM the Holy Spirit speaks, and tells you idols HAVE no\npurpose here. For MORE than Heaven can you never have. If Heaven is within why\nwould you seek for idols which would make of Heaven less, to give you MORE than\nGod bestowed upon your brother AND on you, as One with Him? God GAVE you all\nthere is. And to be sure you could not lose it, did He ALSO give the same to\nevery living thing as well. And thus IS every living thing a part of you as of\nHimself. No idol can establish you as MORE than God. But YOU will never be\ncontent with being LESS.",

    "content": "The Forgiving Dream\n\nThe slave of idols is a WILLING slave. For willing he MUST be, to let\nhimself bow down in worship to what has no life, and seek for power in the\npowerless. What happened to the holy Son of God, that this could BE his wish; to\nlet himself fall lower than the stones upon the ground, and look to idols that\nthey raise him up? Hear, then, your story in the dream you made, and ask yourself\nif it be not the truth that you believe that it is NOT a dream. A dream of\njudgment came into the mind that God created perfect as Himself. And in that\ndream was Heaven changed to hell, and God made enemy unto His Son.\n\nHow can His Son AWAKEN from the dream? It is a dream of judgment. So\nmust he judge NOT, and he WILL waken. For the dream will seem to last while he is\nPART of it. Judge not, for he who judges WILL have need of idols, which will hold\nthe judgment off from resting on himself. Nor CAN he know the Self he has\ncondemned. Judge not, because you make yourself a PART of evil dreams, where\nidols are your “true” identity, and your salvation from the judgment laid, in\nterror and in guilt, upon yourself. All figures in the dream are idols, made to\nsave you FROM the dream. Yet they are PART of what they have been made to save\nyou FROM.\n\nThus does an idol KEEP the dream alive and terrible. For who would\nwish for one UNLESS he were in terror and despair? And this the idol REPRESENTS,\nand so its worship IS the worship of despair and terror, and the dream from which\nthey come. Judgment is an INjustice to God's Son, and it IS justice that who\njudges HIM will not escape the penalty he laid upon HIMSELF within the dream he\nmade. God knows of justice; NOT of penalty. But in the dream of judgment, you\nattack and ARE condemned. And WISH to be the slave of idols, who are interposed\nBETWEEN your judgment and the penalty it brings.\n\nThere CAN be no salvation in the dream, as YOU are dreaming it. For\nidols MUST be part of it, to save you from what you believe you have\naccomplished, and have done to make you sinful, and put out the Light within you.\nLittle children, It is there. You do but dream, and idols are the toys you dream\nyou play with. Who has need of toys but children? They pretend they rule the\nworld, and give their toys the power to move about, and talk and think and feel,\nand speak for them. Yet everything their toys appear to do is in the minds of\nthose who play with them. But they are eager to forget that they made up the\ndream in which their toys are real, and recognize their wishes are their own.\n\nNightmares are childish dreams. Their toys have turned against the\nchild who thought he made them real. Yet CAN a dream attack? Or CAN a toy grow\nlarge and dangerous and fierce and wild? This does the child believe BECAUSE he\nfears his thoughts, and gives them to his toys instead. And their reality becomes\nhis own, because they seem to SAVE him from his thoughts. Yet do they KEEP his\nthoughts alive and real, but seen OUTSIDE himself, where they can turn against\nhim for his treachery to them. He thinks he NEEDS them that he may escape his\nthoughts, because he thinks the THOUGHTS are real. And so he makes of ANYTHING a\ntoy, to make his world remain outside himself, and play that HE is but a part of\nit.\n\nThere is a time when childhood should be passed and gone forever. Seek\nnot to retain the toys of children. Put them all away, for you have need of them\nno more. The dream of judgment is a children's game, in which the child becomes\nthe father, powerful, but with the little wisdom of the child. What hurts him is\ndestroyed; what helps him, blessed. Except he judges this as does a child, who\ndoes not KNOW what hurts and what will heal. And bad things seem to happen, and\nhe is afraid of all the chaos in a world he thinks is governed by the laws he\nmade. Yet is the real world unaffected by the world he thinks is real. Nor have\nits laws been changed because he did not understand.\n\nThe real world still is but a dream. Except the figures have been\nchanged. They are not seen as idols which betray. It is a dream in which no-one\nis used to substitute for something else, or interposed between the thoughts the\nmind conceives and what it sees. No-one is used for something he is not, for\nchildish things have all been put away. And what was once a dream of judgment now\nhas changed into a dream where all is joy, because that is the PURPOSE that it\nhas. Only forgiving dreams can enter here, for time is almost over. And the forms\nwhich enter in the dreams are now perceived as brothers, not in judgment, but in\nlove.\n\nForgiving dreams have little need to last. They are not made to\nseparate the mind from what it thinks. They do not seek to prove the dream is\nbeing dreamed by someone ELSE. And in these dreams a melody is heard which\neveryone remembers, though he has not heard it since before all time began.\nForgiveness, once complete, brings timelessness so close the song of Heaven can\nbe heard, not with the ears, but with the holiness that never left the altar\nwhich abides forever deep within the Son of God. And when he hears this song\nagain, he knows he NEVER heard it not. And where IS time, when dreams of judgment\nhave been put away?\n\nWhenever you feel fear in any form, – and you ARE fearful if you do\nnot feel a deep content, a certainty of help, a calm assurance Heaven goes with\nyou, – be sure you made an idol, and believe it will betray you. For, beneath\nyour hope that it will save you, lie the guilt and pain of self-betrayal and\nuncertainty, so deep and bitter that the dream can not conceal completely all\nyour sense of doom. Your self-betrayal MUST result in fear, and fear IS judgment,\nleading surely to the frantic search for idols and for death. Forgiving dreams\nremind you that you live in safety, and have NOT attacked yourself.\n\nSo do your childish terrors melt away, and dreams become a sign that\nyou have made a new beginning, NOT another try to worship idols, and to KEEP\nattack. Forgiving dreams are kind to everyone who figures in the dream. And so\nthey bring the dreamer full release from dreams of fear. He does not fear his\njudgment, for he has judged no-one, nor has sought to be released THROUGH\njudgment from what judgment MUST impose. And all the while he is remembering what\nhe forgot when judgment seemed to be the way to SAVE him from its penalty.",

    "content": "Rules for Decision\n\nDecisions are continuous. You do not always know when you are making\nthem. But, with a little practice in the ones you recognize, a set begins to form\nwhich sees you through the rest. It is not wise to let yourself become\npreoccupied with every step you take. The proper set, adopted consciously each\ntime you wake, will put you well ahead. And if you find resistance strong and\ndedication weak, you are not ready. DO NOT FIGHT YOURSELF. But think about the\nkind of day you want, and tell yourself there is a way by which this very day can\nhappen just like that. Then try again to HAVE the day you want.\n\nT 30 B 2. 1. The outlook starts with this:\n\n“Today I will make NO decisions by myself.”\n\nThis means that you are choosing NOT to be the judge of what to do. But it must\nALSO mean you will not judge the situations where you will be called upon to make\nresponse. For if you judge them, you HAVE set the rules for how you should react\nto them. And then ANOTHER answer cannot BUT produce confusion and uncertainty AND\nFEAR. This is your major problem now. You still make up your minds, and THEN\ndecide to ask what you should do. And what you hear may not resolve the problem\nAS YOU SAW IT FIRST. This leads to\nfear, because it contradicts what you perceive, and so you feel attacked, AND\nTHEREFORE ANGRY. There are rules by which this will not happen. But it does\noccur, at first, to everyone who listens well.\n\n2. Throughout the day, at any time you think of it, and have a quiet\nmoment for reflection, tell yourself again the kind of day you want; the feelings\nyou would have, the things you WANT to happen, and the things you WOULD\nexperience. And say,\n\n“If I make no decisions by myself,\n\nThis is the day that will be GIVEN me.”\n\nThese two procedures, practiced well, will serve to let you be directed WITHOUT\nfear, for opposition will not FIRST arise, and THEN become a problem in itself.\nBut there will still be times when you have judged ALREADY. Now the answer will\nprovoke attack, unless you quickly straighten out your mind to WANT an answer\nthat will work. Be certain this has happened, if you feel yourself to be\nunwilling to sit by, and ask to have the answer GIVEN you. This means you HAVE\ndecided by yourself, AND CANNOT SEE THE QUESTION. Now you need a quick\nrestorative BEFORE you ask.\n\n3. Remember once again the day you want, and recognize that something\nhas occurred which is not part of it. Then realize that you have asked a question\nby yourself, and MUST have set an answer in your terms. Then say,\n\n“I HAVE no question. I forgot what to decide.”\n\nThis cancels out the terms which you have set, and lets the ANSWER show you what\nthe question MUST have really been. Try to observe this rule without delay\nDESPITE your opposition. For you have ALREADY gotten angry, and your fear of\nbeing answered in a different way from what YOUR version of the question asks\nwill gain momentum until you believe the day you want is one in which you get\nYOUR answer to your question. And you will not get it, for it would destroy\nthe day by robbing you of what you REALLY want. This can be very hard to realize,\nwhen once you have decided by yourself the rules which PROMISE you a happy day.\nBut these decisions still can be undone, by simple methods which you CAN accept.\n\n4. If you are so unwilling to receive you cannot even let your\nQUESTION go, you can begin to change your mind with this:\n\n“At least I can decide I do not LIKE what I feel now.”\n\nThis much is obvious, and paves the way for the next easy step, which follows\nthis.\n\n5. Having decided that you do not like the way you feel, what could be\neasier than to continue with –\n\n“And so I HOPE I have been wrong.”\n\nThis works AGAINST the sense of opposition, and reminds you that help is not\nbeing thrust upon you, but is something that you want and that you need BECAUSE\nyou do not like the way you feel. This tiny opening will be enough to let you go\nahead with just a few more steps you need to LET yourself be helped.\n\n6. Now you have reached the turning point, because it has occurred to\nyou that YOU will gain, if what you have decided is NOT so. Until this point is\nreached, you will believe your happiness DEPENDS on being right. But this much\nreason have you now attained; YOU would be better off if you were WRONG. This\ntiny grain of wisdom will suffice to take you further. You are NOT coerced, but\nmerely hope to have a thing you WANT. And you can say in perfect honesty,\n\n“I WANT another way to look at this.”\n\nNow you have changed your mind about the day, and have REMEMBERED what you really\nwant. Its PURPOSE has no longer been obscured by the insane belief you want it\nfor the goal of being RIGHT when you are WRONG. This is the READINESS for\nasking, brought to your awareness, for you CANNOT be in conflict when you\n\n7. This final step is but acknowledgment of LACK of opposition to be\nhelped. It is a statement of an open mind, not certain yet, but willing to be\nshown:\n\n“Perhaps there IS another way to look at this.\n\nWhat can I LOSE by asking?”\n\nThus are you made ready for a question that makes sense, and so the ANSWER will\nmake sense as well. Nor will you fight AGAINST it, for you see that it is YOU who\nwill be helped by it.\n\nIt MUST be clear that it is easier to have a happy day if you PREVENT\nunhappiness from entering at all. But this takes practice in the rules which will\nPROTECT you from the ravages of fear. When THIS has been achieved, the sorry\ndream of judgment has FOREVER been undone. But, meanwhile, you have need for\npracticing the rules for its undoing. Let us, then, consider once again the very\nfirst of the decisions which are offered here. We said you can begin a happy day\nwith the determination NOT to make decisions by yourself. This SEEMS to be a free\ndecision in itself. And yet, you CANNOT make decisions by yourself. The only\nquestion really is WITH WHAT you choose to make them. That is really all.\n\nThe first rule, then, is not coercion, but a simple statement of a\nsimple fact. You WILL not make decisions by yourself whatever you decide. For\nthey are made with idols or with God. And you ask help of Christ or anti-\nChrist, and which you choose WILL join with you, and tell you what to do. Your\nday is NOT at random. It is set by what you choose to live it WITH, and HOW the\nfriend whose counsel you have sought perceives your happiness. You ALWAYS ask\nadvice before you can decide ANYTHING. Let THIS be understood, and you can see\nthere cannot BE coercion here, nor grounds for opposition that you may be free.\nThere IS no freedom from what must occur. And if you think there is, you MUST be\nwrong.\n\nThe second rule as well is but a fact. For you and your adviser must\nAGREE on what you want BEFORE it can occur. It is but this AGREEMENT which\npermits all things to happen. NOTHING can be caused without some form of union,\nbe it with a dream of judgment or the Voice for God. Decisions cause results\nBECAUSE they are not made in isolation. They are made by you and your adviser,\nfor yourself, AND FOR THE WORLD AS WELL. The day you want you offer to the world,\nfor it WILL be what you have asked for, and will reinforce the rule of your\nadviser through the world. Whose kingdom is the world for you today? What kind of\nday will you decide to have?\n\nIt needs but two who would have happiness this day to promise it to\nall the world. It needs but two to understand that they can not decide alone, to\nGUARANTEE the joy they asked for will be wholly shared. For they have understood\nthe basic law which MAKES decision powerful, and gives it all effects that it\nwill EVER have. It needs but two. These two ARE joined before there CAN be a\ndecision. Let this be the ONE reminder that you keep in mind, and you will have\nthe day you want, and give it to the world by having it yourselves. Your judgment\nhas been LIFTED from the world by your decision for a happy day. And as you have\nreceived so MUST you give.",

UNLESS you do your\nwill, you are NOT free. And would God leave His Son WITHOUT what he has chosen\nfor himself? God but ensured that you would never LOSE your will, when He gave\nyou His perfect Answer. Hear It now, that you may be reminded of His Love, and\nlearn YOUR will. God would not have His Son made prisoner to what he does not\nwant. He JOINS with you in willing you be free.

    "content": "Beyond All Idols\n\nIdols are quite specific. But your will is universal, being limitless.\nAnd so it has NO form, nor is content for its expression in the terms of form.\nIdols are LIMITS; they are the belief that there are FORMS which will bring\nhappiness, and that, BY limiting, is all attained. It is as if you said, “I have\nno need of everything. This LITTLE thing I want, and it will BE as everything to\nme.” And this MUST fail to satisfy, because it IS your will that everything be\nyours. Decide for idols, and you ask for LOSS. Decide for truth, and everything\nIS yours.\n\nIT IS NOT FORM YOU SEEK. What form can be a substitute for God the\nFather's Love? What form can take the place of all the love in the divinity of\nGod the Son? What idol can make two of what IS one? And CAN the limitless be\nlimited? You do not WANT an idol. It is NOT your will to have one. It will NOT\nbestow on you the gift you seek. When you decide upon the FORM of what you want,\nyou LOSE the understanding of its purpose. So you see YOUR will within the idol,\nthus reducing it to a SPECIFIC form. But this could never BE your will, because\nwhat shares in all creation CANNOT be content with SMALL ideas and LITTLE things.\n\nBehind the search for EVERY idol lies the yearning for completion.\nWholeness has no form BECAUSE it is unlimited. To seek a special person or a\nthing to ADD to you to make yourself complete, can ONLY mean that you believe\nsome FORM is missing. And, by finding THIS, you will achieve completion in a FORM\nyou like. This is the purpose of an idol; that you will not look BEYOND it, to\nthe source of your belief that you ARE incomplete. ONLY if you had sinned could\nthis be so. For sin is the IDEA you are alone, and separated OFF from what is\nwhole. And thus it WOULD be necessary for the search for wholeness to be made\nBEYOND the boundaries of limits on yourself.\n\nIt NEVER is the idol that you want. But what you think it OFFERS you,\nyou want indeed, and have the RIGHT to ask for. Nor could it be POSSIBLE it be\ndenied. Your will to be complete IS but God's will, and this is given you BY\nbeing His. God knows not form. He CANNOT answer you in terms which have no\nmeaning. And YOUR will could not BE satisfied with empty forms, made but to fill\na gap which is not there. It is not this you WANT. Creation gives no SEPARATE\nperson and no SEPARATE thing the power to complete the Son of God. What idol CAN\nbe called upon to give the Son of God what he already HAS?\n\nCompletion is the FUNCTION of God's Son. He has no need to SEEK for it\nat all. Beyond ALL idols stands his holy will to be but what he IS. For MORE than\nwhole is meaningless. If there were change in him; if he could be reduced to ANY\nform and limited to what is NOT in him, he would not BE as God created him. What\nidol CAN he need to be himself? For CAN he give a part of him away? What is not\nwhole cannot MAKE whole. But what is REALLY asked for CANNOT be denied. Your will\nIS granted. NOT in any form that would content you not, but in the whole,\ncompletely lovely Thought God holds of you.\n\nNothing that God knows not exists. And what He knows exists forever,\nchangelessly. For thoughts endure as long as does the mind that thought of them,\nand in the Mind of God there is no ending, nor a time in which His Thoughts were\nabsent, or could suffer change. Thoughts are not born and cannot die. They share\nthe attributes of their creator, nor have they a separate life, apart from him.\nThe thoughts YOU think are in your mind, as you are in the Mind Which thought of\nyou. And so there ARE no separate parts in what exists within God's Mind. It is\nforever One, eternally united and at peace.\n\nThoughts SEEM to come and go. But all this means is that you are\nsometimes AWARE of them, and sometimes not. An unremembered thought is born again\ntoo YOU when it returns to your awareness. Yet it did not die when you forgot it.\nIt was ALWAYS there, but YOU were unaware of it. The Thought God holds of you is\nperfectly unchanged by your forgetting. It will ALWAYS be exactly as it was\nbefore the time when you forgot, and will be just the same when you remember. And\nit is the same WITHIN the interval when you forgot. The Thoughts of God are FAR\nbeyond all change, and shine forever. They await not birth. They wait for welcome\nand remembering.\n\nThe Thought God holds of you is like a star, unchangeable in an\neternal sky. So high in Heaven is it set that those outside of Heaven know not it\nis there. But still and white and lovely will it shine through all eternity.\nThere was no time it was not there. No instant when its light grew dimmer or less\nperfect ever was. Who knows the Father knows this light, for He is the eternal\nsky which holds it safe, forever lifted up and anchored sure. Its perfect purity\ndoes not depend on whether it is seen on earth or not. The sky embraces it, and\nsoftly holds it in its perfect place, which is as far from earth as earth from\nHeaven. It is not the distance nor the time which keeps this star invisible to\nearth. But those who seek for idols CANNOT know this star is there.\n\nBeyond all idols is the Thought God holds of you. Completely\nunaffected by the turmoil and the terror of the world, the dreams of birth and\ndeath that here are dreamed, the myriad of forms that fear can take, quite\nundisturbed, the Thought God holds of you remains EXACTLY as It always was.\nSurrounded by a stillness so complete no sound of battle comes remotely near, It\nrests in certainty and perfect peace. Here is your ONE reality kept safe,\ncompletely unaware of all the world that worships idols, and that knows not God.\nIn perfect sureness of Its changelessness and of Its rest in Its eternal home,\nthe Thought God holds of you has never left the Mind of Its Creator, Whom It\nknows as Its Creator knows that It is there.\n\nWhere could the Thought God holds of you EXIST but where you are? Is\nyour reality a thing APART from you, and in a world which your reality knows\nNOTHING of? Outside you there IS no eternal sky, no changeless star, and NO\nreality. The Mind of Heaven's Son in Heaven is, for there the Mind of Father and\nof Son joined in creation which can HAVE no end. You have not two realities, but\nOne. Nor can you be AWARE of more than one.

    "content": "The Truth Behind Illusions\n\nYou WILL attack what does not satisfy, and thus you will not see you\nmade it up. You ALWAYS fight illusions. For the truth behind them is so lovely\nand so still in loving gentleness, were you AWARE of it, you would forget\ndefensiveness entirely, and rush to its embrace. The truth could never BE\nattacked. And this you knew when you made idols. They were made that this might\nbe forgotten. You attack but FALSE ideas, and NEVER truthful ones. All idols ARE\nthe false ideas you made to fill the gap you think arose between yourself and\nwhat is true. And you attack them for the things you think they REPRESENT. What\nlies BEYOND them cannot BE attacked.\n\nThe wearying, dissatisfying gods you made are blown-up children's\ntoys. A child IS frightened when a wooden head springs up as a closed box is\nopened suddenly. Or when a soft and silent wooly bear begins to squeak as he\ntakes hold of it. The rules he made for boxes and for bears have failed him, and\nhave broken his control of what surrounds him. And he is afraid because he\nthought the rules PROTECTED him. Now must he learn the boxes and the bears did\nNOT deceive him, broke no rules, nor mean his world is made chaotic and unsafe.\nHE WAS MISTAKEN. He misunderstood what MADE him safe, and thought that it had\nleft.\n\nThe gap that is not there is filled with toys in countless forms. And\neach one seems to break the rules you set for it. It never WAS the thing you\nthought. It MUST appear to break your rules for safety, since the RULES are\nwrong. But YOU are not endangered. You can laugh at popping heads and squeaking\ntoys, as does the child who learns they are no threat to him. But while he likes\nto play with them, he still perceives them as obeying rules he made for his\nenjoyment. So there still are rules which they can seem to break, and frighten\nhim. Yet IS he at the mercy of his toys? And CAN they represent a threat to him?\n\nReality observes the laws of God, and NOT the rules you set. It is His\nlaws which GUARANTEE your safety. All illusions that you believe about yourself\nobey NO laws. They seem to dance a little while, according to the rules you set\nfor them. But then they fall, and cannot rise again. They are but toys, my\nchildren. Do not grieve for them. Their dancing never brought you joy, but\nneither were they things to frighten you, nor make you safe if they obeyed your\nrules. They must be neither cherished NOR attacked, but merely looked upon as\nchildren's toys, without a SINGLE meaning of their own. See ONE in them, and you\nwill see them all. See NONE in them, and they will touch you not.\n\nAppearances deceive BECAUSE they are appearances, and not reality.\nDwell not on them in ANY form. They but OBSCURE reality. And they bring fear\nBECAUSE they hide the truth. Do not attack what you have made to LET you be\ndeceived. For thus you prove that you HAVE BEEN deceived. Attack HAS power to\nmake illusions real. Yet what it makes is nothing. Who could be made fearful by a\npower that can have no REAL effects at all? What could it BE but an illusion,\nmaking things appear like to itself? Look calmly at its toys, and understand that\nthey are idols which but dance to vain desires. Give them not your worship, for\nthey are not there. But this is EQUALLY forgotten in attack.\n\nGod's Son needs NO defense against his dreams. His idols do not\nthreaten him at all. His ONE mistake is that he thinks them real. What can the\npower of illusions DO? Appearances can but deceive the mind that WANTS to be\ndeceived. And you can make a simple choice that will forever place you far BEYOND\ndeception. You need not concern yourself with HOW this will be done, for this\nyou CANNOT understand. But you WILL understand that mighty changes have been\nquickly brought about, when you decide one very simple thing; you do not WANT\nwhatever you believe an idol gives. For thus the Son of God declares that he is\nfree of idols. And thus IS he free.\n\nSalvation is a paradox indeed! What could it be EXCEPT a happy dream?\nFor you are asked but to forgive all things that no-one ever did; to overlook\nwhat is not there; and not to look upon the unreal as reality. You are but asked\nto let your will be done, and seek no longer for the things you do not want. And\nyou are asked to let yourself be free of all the dreams of what you never were,\nand seek no more to substitute the strength of idle wishes for the Will of God.\nHere does the dream of separation start to fade and disappear. For here the gap\nthat is not there begins to be perceived without the toys of terror that you\nmade.\n\nNo more than this is asked. Be glad indeed salvation asks so little,\nNOT so much. It asks for NOTHING in reality. And even in illusions it but asks\nforgiveness be the substitute for fear. Such is the ONLY rule for happy dreams.\nThe gap is emptied of the toys of fear, and then its unreality is plain. Dreams\nare for nothing. And the Son of God CAN have no need of them. They offer him no\nsingle thing that he could ever want. He is DELIVERED from illusions by his will,\nand but restored to what he IS. What could God's plan for his salvation BE,\nexcept a means to give him to Himself?",

    "content": "The Only Purpose\n\nThe real world is the state of mind in which the ONLY purpose of the\nworld is seen to be forgiveness. Fear is NOT its goal, and the ESCAPE from guilt\nbecomes its aim. The VALUE of forgiveness is perceived, and TAKES THE PLACE of\nidols, which are sought no longer, for their “gifts” are not held dear. No rules\nare idly set, and no demands are made of anyone or anything to twist and fit into\nthe dream of fear. Instead, there is a wish to understand all things created as\nthey really are. And it is recognized that all things must be FIRST forgiven, and\nTHEN understood. Here, it is thought that understanding is ACQUIRED by attack.\nThere it is clear that BY attack is understanding LOST.\n\nThe folly of pursuing guilt as GOAL is fully recognized. And idols are\nnot wanted there, for guilt is recognized as the sole cause of pain in any form.\nNo-one is tempted by its vain appeal, for suffering and death have been perceived\nas things NOT wanted, and not striven FOR. The possibility of freedom has been\ngrasped and welcomed, and the means by which it can be gained can now be\nunderstood. The world becomes a place of hope, because its only purpose is to BE\na place where hope of happiness can be fulfilled. And no-one stands outside this\nhope, because the world has been united in belief the purpose of the world is one\nwhich all must SHARE, if hope be more than just a dream.\n\nNot yet is Heaven quite remembered, for the purpose of forgiveness\nstill remains. Yet everyone is certain he will go BEYOND forgiveness, and he but\nremains until it is made perfect in himself. He has no wish for anything but\nthis. And fear has dropped away, because he is united in his purpose with\nHIMSELF. There is a hope of happiness in him so sure and constant he can barely\nstay, and wait a little longer with his feet still touching earth. Yet is he glad\nto wait 'til every hand is joined, and every heart made ready to arise and go\nwith him. For thus is HE made ready for the step in which is all forgiveness left\nbehind.\n\nThe final step is God's, because it is but God Who could create a\nperfect Son, and share His Fatherhood with him. No-one outside of Heaven knows\nhow this can be. For understanding this is Heaven itself. Even the real world has\na purpose still beneath creation and eternity. But fear is gone, because its\npurpose is forgiveness, NOT idolatry. And so is Heaven's Son prepared to be\nHimself, and to remember that the Son of God knows everything his Father\nunderstands, and understands it perfectly with Him. The real world still falls\nshort of this, for this is God's Own Purpose; ONLY His, and yet completely shared\nand perfectly fulfilled.\n\nThe real world is a state in which the mind has learned how easily do\nidols go when they are still perceived, but wanted not. How willingly the mind\ncan let them go when it has understood that idols are nothing and nowhere, AND\nARE PURPOSELESS. For only then can guilt and sin be seen WITHOUT a purpose, and\nas meaningless. Thus is the real world's purpose gently brought into awareness,\nto REPLACE the goal of sin and guilt. And all that stood BETWEEN your image of\nyourself and what you ARE forgiveness washes joyfully away. Yet God need not\ncreate His Son AGAIN, that what is his be given BACK to him. The gap between your\nbrother and yourself was never there. And what the Son of God knew in creation he\nMUST know again.\n\nWhen brothers join in purpose in the world of fear, they stand ALREADY\nat the edge of the real world. Perhaps they still look back, and think they see\nan idol that they want. Yet has their path been surely set AWAY from idols toward\nreality, for when they joined their hands, it was Christ's hand they took. And\nthey WILL look on Him Whose hand they hold. The face of Christ is looked upon\nBEFORE the Father is remembered. For He MUST be unremembered 'til His Son has\nreached BEYOND forgiveness to the Love of God. Yet is the love of Christ accepted\nfirst. And THEN will come the knowledge They are One. How light and easy is the\nstep across the narrow boundaries of the world of fear, when you have RECOGNIZED\nWhose hand you hold!\n\nWithin your hand is everything you need to walk with perfect\nconfidence away from fear forever. And to go straight on, and quickly reach the\ngate of Heaven itself. For He Whose hand you hold was waiting but for you to join\nHim. Now that you have come, would HE delay in showing you the way that He must\nwalk with you? His blessing lies on you as surely as His Father's Love rests upon\nHim. His gratitude to you is past your understanding, for you have enabled Him to\nrise from chains, and go with you TOGETHER to His Father's house. An ancient hate\nis passing from the world, and with it goes ALL hatred and ALL fear. Look back no\nlonger, for what lies ahead is all you EVER wanted in your hearts.\n\nGive up the world! But NOT to sacrifice. You never WANTED it. What\nhappiness have you sought here that did not bring you pain? What moment of\ncontent has not been bought at fearful price in coins of suffering? Joy HAS no\ncost. It is your sacred right. And what you pay for is NOT happiness. Be speeded\non your way by honesty, and let not your experiences here deceive in retrospect.\nThey were NOT free from bitter cost and joyless consequence. Do not look back\nexcept in honesty. And when an idol tempts you, think of this; there never was a\ntime an idol brought you ANYTHING except the “gift” of guilt. Not one was bought\nEXCEPT at cost of pain. Nor was it ever paid by you alone.\n\nBe merciful unto your brother, then. And do not choose an idol\nthoughtlessly, remembering that he will pay the cost as well as you. For HE will\nbe delayed when you look back, and YOU will not perceive Whose hand you hold.\nLook forward, then, and walk in confidence, with happy hearts that beat in hope\nand do not pound in fear. The Will of God forever lies in those whose hands are\njoined. UNTIL they joined, they thought He was their enemy. But when they joined",

    "content": "The Justification for Forgiveness\n\nAnger is NEVER justified. Attack has NO foundation. It is here escape\nfrom fear begins, and will be made complete. Here is the real world given in\nexchange for dreams of terror. For it is on this forgiveness rests, AND IS BUT\nNATURAL. You are NOT asked to offer pardon where attack is due, and WOULD be\njustified. For this would mean that you forgive a sin by overlooking what is\nREALLY there. THIS IS NOT PARDON. For it would assume that, by responding in a\nway which is NOT justified, your PARDON will become the answer to attack which\nHAS been made. And thus is pardon inappropriate, by being granted where it is NOT\ndue.\n\nPardon is ALWAYS justified, and has a sure foundation. You do NOT\nforgive the unforgivable, nor overlook a REAL attack that calls for punishment.\nSalvation does not lie in being asked to make unnatural responses, which are\ninappropriate to what is real. Instead, it merely asks that you respond\nappropriately to what is NOT real, by not perceiving what has not occurred. If\npardon WERE unjustified, you WOULD be asked to sacrifice your rights when you\nreturn forgiveness for attack. But you are merely asked to see forgiveness as the\nNATURAL reaction to distress which rests on error, and thus calls for help.\nForgiveness is the ONLY sane response. It KEEPS your rights from being lost to\nyou.\n\nThis understanding is the ONLY change that lets the real world rise to\ntake the place of dreams of terror. Fear cannot ARISE unless attack is justified.\nAnd if it HAD a real foundation, pardon could have none. The real world is\nachieved when you perceive the basis of FORGIVENESS is quite real and fully\njustified. While you regard it as a gift unwarranted, it MUST uphold the guilt\nyou would “forgive.” Unjustified forgiveness IS attack. And this is all the world\ncan ever give. It pardons “sinners” sometimes, but remains AWARE that they have\nsinned. And so they do not MERIT the forgiveness that it gives.\n\nThis is the false forgiveness which the world employs to KEEP the\nsense of sin alive. And recognizing God is just, it seems impossible His pardon\nCOULD be real. Thus is the fear of God the sure result of seeing pardon as\nunmerited. No-one who sees himself as guilty CAN avoid the fear of God. But he is\nSAVED from this dilemma if HE can forgive. The mind MUST think of its Creator as\nit looks upon itself. If you can see your brother MERITS pardon, you have learned\nforgiveness is YOUR right, as much as his. Nor will you think that God intends\nfor you a fearful judgment which your brother does not merit. For it is the truth\nthat you CAN merit neither more nor less than he.\n\nForgiveness RECOGNIZED as merited will heal. It gives the miracle its\nstrength to OVERLOOK illusions. This is how you learn that you must be forgiven\ntoo. There CAN be no appearance that can NOT be overlooked. For, if there were,\nit would be necessary FIRST there be some sin which stands BEYOND forgiveness.\nThere would be an error that is MORE than a mistake; a special FORM of error,\nwhich remains unchangeable, eternal, and beyond correction or escape. There would\nbe one mistake which had the power to UNDO creation, and to make a world which\ncould REPLACE it and DESTROY the Will of God. Only if this were possible could\nthere be SOME appearances which could withstand the miracle, and NOT be healed by\nit.\n\nThere is no surer proof idolatry is what you wish than a belief there\nare some forms of sickness and of joylessness forgiveness CANNOT cure. This means\nthat you prefer to keep SOME idols, and are not prepared, as yet, to let ALL\nidols go. And thus you think that SOME appearances are real, and not appearances\nat all. Be not deceived about the MEANING of a fixed belief that SOME appearances\nare harder to look past than others are. It ALWAYS means you think forgiveness\nmust be limited. And you have set a goal of partial pardon and a limited escape\nfrom guilt FOR YOU. What can this be, except a false forgiveness of YOURSELF, and\neveryone who seems APART from you?\n\nIt MUST be true the miracle can heal ALL forms of sickness, or it\nCANNOT HEAL. Its purpose cannot be to judge which FORMS are real, and which\nAPPEARANCES are true. If one appearance must remain APART from healing, one\nillusion must be part of truth. And you could NOT escape all guilt, but only SOME\nof it. You must forgive God's Son ENTIRELY. Or you will keep an image of yourself\nthat is not whole, and will remain afraid to look within, and find escape from\nEVERY idol there. Salvation rests on faith there CANNOT be some forms of guilt\nwhich you can NOT forgive. And so there cannot be appearances which have replaced\nthe truth about God's Son.\n\nLook on your brother with the willingness to see him as he is. And do\nnot keep a part of him outside your willingness that he be healed. To heal is to\nmake whole. And what is whole can HAVE no missing parts that have been kept\noutside. Forgiveness rests on recognizing this, and being GLAD there cannot be\nsome forms of sickness which the miracle must LACK the power to heal. God's Son\nis perfect, or he cannot be God's Son. Nor will you KNOW him, if you think he\ndoes not merit the escape from guilt in ALL its forms and ALL its consequence.\nThere IS no way to think of him but this, if you would know the truth about\nyourself:\n\n“I thank you, Father, for your perfect Son,\n\nAnd in his glory will I see my own.”\n\nHere is the joyful statement that there are NO forms of evil which can\novercome the Will of God; the glad acknowledgment that guilt has NOT succeeded,\nby your wish, to make illusions real. And what is this, except a simple statement\nof the truth? Look on your brother with this hope in you, and you will understand\nhe COULD not make an error that could change the truth in him. It is NOT\ndifficult to overlook mistakes that have been given no effects. But what you see\nas having power to make an idol of the Son of God, you will NOT pardon. For he\nhas become to you a graven image, and a sign of death. Is THIS your Savior? Is\nhis Father WRONG about His Son? Or have YOU been deceived in him who has been\ngiven you to heal for YOUR salvation and deliverance?",

    "content": "The New Interpretation\n\nWould God have left the meaning of the world to YOUR interpretation?\nIf He had, it HAS no meaning. For it cannot be that meaning changes constantly,\nand yet is true. The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as with ONE purpose,\nchangelessly established. And NO situation can affect its aim, but MUST be in\naccord with it. For ONLY if its aim could change with every situation could each\none be OPEN to interpretation which is different every time you think of it. You\nADD an element into the script you write for every minute in the day, and all\nthat happens now means something else. You TAKE AWAY another element, and every\nmeaning shifts accordingly.\n\nWhat do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day SHOULD\nbe? And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat, and gain and loss.\nThese judgments all are made according to the roles the script assigns. The fact\nthey have no meaning in themselves is DEMONSTRATED by the ease with which these\nlabels change with other judgments made on different aspects of experience. And\nthen, in looking back, you think you see ANOTHER meaning in what went before.\nWhat have you really done, except to show there WAS no meaning there? And YOU\nassigned a meaning in the light of goals that change, with EVERY meaning shifting\nas they change.\n\nOnly a CONSTANT purpose can endow events with stable meaning. But it\nmust ACCORD ONE MEANING TO THEM ALL. If they are given DIFFERENT meanings, it\nMUST mean that they reflect but different purposes, and this is ALL the meaning\nthat they have. Can this BE meaning? Can confusion BE what meaning means?\nPerception CANNOT be in constant flux, and make allowance for stability of\nmeaning ANYWHERE. Fear is a judgment NEVER justified. Its presence has no meaning\nbut to show you wrote a fearful script, and are afraid accordingly. But NOT\nbecause the thing you fear has fearful meaning in itself.\n\nA common purpose is the ONLY means whereby perception can be\nstabilized, and ONE interpretation given to the world and all experiences here.\nIn this shared purpose is one meaning shared by everyone and everything you see.\nYou do not have to judge, for you have learned one meaning has been GIVEN\neverything, and you are GLAD to see it everywhere. It cannot change BECAUSE you\nwould perceive it everywhere, unchanged by circumstance. And so you OFFER it to\nall events, and LET them offer you stability. Escape from judgment simply lies in\nthis; - All things have but one purpose, which you share with all the world. And\nnothing IN the world can BE opposed to it, for it belongs TO everything, as it\nbelongs to you.\n\nIn SINGLE purpose is the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which MUST\nassume a DIFFERENT purpose for the one who gains and him who loses. There could\nBE no thought of sacrifice apart from this idea. And it IS this idea of different\ngoals which makes perception shift and meaning change. In one united goal does\nthis become impossible, for your AGREEMENT makes interpretation stabilize and\nlast. How can communication REALLY be established, while the symbols which are\nused mean different things? The Holy Spirit's goal gives ONE interpretation,\nmeaningful to you AND to your brother. Thus can you communicate with him, and he\nwith you. In symbols which you BOTH can understand, the sacrifice of meaning is\nundone.\n\nAll sacrifice entails the LOSS of your ability to see relationships\nAMONG events. And, looked at SEPARATELY, they HAVE no meaning. For there is no\nlight by which they can be seen and understood. They HAVE no purpose. And what\nthey are FOR cannot BE seen. In any thought of loss there IS no meaning. No-one\nhas agreed with you on what it means. It is a part of a distorted script, which\ncannot be interpreted with meaning. It must be forever unintelligible. This is\nNOT communication. Your dark dreams are but the senseless, isolated scripts you\nwrite in sleep. Look not to separate dreams for meaning. ONLY dreams of pardon\ncan be shared. They mean the same for BOTH of you.\n\nDo not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing. It\nwill shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the world is an uncertain\nplace, in which you walk in danger and uncertainty. It is but your\nINTERPRETATIONS which are lacking in stability. And they are NOT in line with\nwhat you really are. This is a state so seemingly unsafe that fear MUST rise. Do\nnot continue thus, my brothers. We have ONE Interpreter. And through His use of\nsymbols are we joined, so that they mean the same to ALL of us. Our common\nlanguage lets us speak to all our brothers, and to understand with them\nforgiveness has been given to us all, and thus we CAN communicate again.",

The miracle\nattests salvation FROM appearances by SHOWING they can change.\n\nYour brother has a changelessness in him beyond appearance and\ndeception both. It is obscured by changing views of him which you PERCEIVE as his\nreality. The happy dream about him takes the form of the appearance of his\nperfect health; his perfect freedom from all forms of lack; and safety from\ndisaster of all kinds. The miracle is proof he is not bound by loss or suffering\nin any form BECAUSE IT CAN SO EASILY BE CHANGED. This demonstrates that it was\nnever real, and COULD not stem from his reality. For that is changeless, and has\nno effects which anything in Heaven or on earth could ever alter. But appearances\nare shown to be unreal BECAUSE they change.\n\nWhat is temptation but a wish to make illusions real? It does not SEEM\nto be the wish that NO reality be so. But it IS an assertion that some FORMS of\nidols have a powerful appeal which makes them HARDER to resist than those you\nwould not WANT to have reality. Temptation, then, is nothing more than this; - a\nprayer the miracle touch not some dreams, but KEEP their unreality obscure, and\nGIVE to them reality instead. And Heaven gives no answer to the prayer, nor CAN\nthe miracle be given you to heal appearances you do not like. YOU HAVE\nESTABLISHED LIMITS. What you ask IS given you, but not of God Who knows no\nlimits. YOU have limited YOURSELF.\n\nReality is changeless. Miracles but show what you have interposed\nBETWEEN reality and your awareness is unreal, and does not interfere at all. The\ncost of the belief there must be some appearances BEYOND the hope of change is\nthat the miracle cannot come forth from you consistently. For you have ASKED it\nbe withheld from power to heal all dreams. There is no miracle you cannot have\nwhen you DESIRE healing. But there is no miracle that CAN be given you UNLESS you\nwant it. CHOOSE what you would heal, and He Who gives all miracles has not been\ngiven freedom to bestow His gifts upon God's Son. When he is tempted, he DENIES\nreality. And he becomes the willing slave of what he chose instead.\n\nBECAUSE reality is changeless is a miracle already there to heal all\nthings that change, and offer them to you to see in happy form, devoid of fear.\nIt WILL be given you to look upon your brother thus. But NOT while you would have\nit otherwise in some respects. For this but means you would not have him healed\nand whole. The Christ in him is perfect. Is it this that you would look upon?\nThen let there be no dreams about him that you would PREFER to seeing this. And\nyou WILL see the Christ in him because you LET Him come to you. And when He has\nappeared to you, you will be certain you are like Him, for He is the changeless\nin your brother AND in you.\n\nThis will you look upon, when you decide there is not one appearance\nyou would hold in place of what your brother really IS. Let no temptation to\nprefer a dream allow uncertainty to enter here. Be not made guilty and afraid\nwhen you are tempted by a dream of what he is. But do not give it power to\nREPLACE the changeless in him in your sight of him. There is no false appearance\nbut will fade, if you request a miracle instead. There is no pain from which he\nis not free, if you would have him be but what he is. Why should you fear to see\nthe Christ in him? You but behold yourself in what you see. As he is healed are\nYOU made free of guilt, and his appearance IS your own to you.",

    "content": "Introduction\n\nHow simple is salvation! All it says is what was never true is not\ntrue now, and never will be. The impossible has NOT occurred, and CAN have no\neffects. And that is all. Can this BE hard to learn by anyone who WANTS it to be\ntrue? ONLY unwillingness to learn it could make such an easy lesson difficult.\nHow hard is it to see that what is false can not be true, and what is true can\nnot be false? You can no longer say that you perceive no differences in false and\ntrue. You have been told EXACTLY how to tell one from the other, and just what to\ndo if you become confused. Why, then, do you persist in learning NOT such simple\nthings?\n\nThere IS a reason. But confuse it not with difficulty in the simple\nthings salvation asks you learn. It teaches but the very obvious. It merely goes\nfrom one apparent lesson to the next, in easy steps which lead you gently from\none to another, with no strain at all. This CANNOT be confusing, yet you ARE\nconfused. For somehow you believe that what is TOTALLY confused is easier to\nlearn and understand. What you have taught yourselves is such a giant learning\nfeat it is indeed incredible. But you accomplished it because you wanted to, and\ndid not pause in diligence to judge it hard to learn, or too complex to grasp.\n\nNo-one who understands what you have learned, how carefully you\nlearned it, and the pains to which you went to practice and repeat the lessons\nendlessly, in every form you could conceive of them, could EVER doubt the power\nof your learning skill. There is no greater power in the world. The world was\nMADE by it, and even now depends on nothing else. The lessons you have taught\nyourselves have been so overlearned and fixed they rise like heavy curtains, to\nobscure the simple and the obvious. Say not you cannot learn them. For your power\nto learn is strong enough to teach you that your will is not your own; your\nthoughts do not belong to you; and even YOU are someone else.\n\nWho could maintain that lessons such as these are easy? Yet you have\nlearned more than this. You have continued, taking every step, however difficult,\nwithout complaint, until a world was built that suited you. And every lesson that\nmakes up the world arises from the first accomplishment of learning; an enormity\nso great the Holy Spirit's Voice seems small and still before its magnitude. The\nworld began with one strange lesson, powerful enough to render God forgotten, and\nHis Son an alien to himself, in exile from the home where God Himself established\nhim. You who have taught yourselves the Son of God is guilty, say not that you\ncannot learn the simple things salvation teaches you.\n\nLearning is an ability you made, and gave yourselves. It was NOT made\nto do the Will of God, but to uphold a wish that It COULD be opposed, and that a\nwill APART from It was yet more real than It. And this has learning sought to\ndemonstrate, and you HAVE learned what it was made to teach. Now does your\nancient overlearning stand implacable before the Voice of Truth, and teach you\nthat Its lessons are not true; too hard to learn, too difficult to see, and too\nopposed to what is REALLY true. Yet you WILL learn them, for their learning is\nthe ONLY purpose for your learning skill the Holy Spirit sees in all the world.\n\nHis simple lessons in forgiveness have a power mightier than yours,\nbecause they call from God and from your Self to you. Is this a LITTLE Voice, so\nsmall and still It cannot rise above the senseless noise of sounds which have no\nmeaning? God willed not His Son forget Him. And the power of His Will is in the\nVoice That speaks for Him. Which lesson will you learn? Which outcome is\ninevitable, sure as God, and far beyond all doubts or question? CAN it be your\nlittle learning, strange in outcome, and incredible in difficulty, will\nwithstand the simple lessons being taught to you in every moment of each day,\nsince time began and learning had been made?\n\nThe lessons to be learned are only two. Each has its outcome in a\ndifferent world. And each world follows surely from its source. The certain\noutcome of the lesson that God's Son is guilty is the world you see. It IS a\nworld of terror and despair. Nor IS there hope of happiness in it. There IS no\nplan for safety you can make that ever will succeed. There IS no joy that you can\nseek for here, and hope to find. But this is NOT the only outcome which your\nlearning can produce. However much you may have overlearned your chosen task, the\nlesson which reflects the Love of God is stronger still. And you WILL learn\nGod's Son is innocent, and see ANOTHER world.\n\nThe outcome of the lesson that God's Son is guiltless is a world in\nwhich there is no fear, and everything is lit with hope, and sparkles with a\ngentle friendliness. Nothing but calls to you in soft appeal to be your friend,\nand let it join with you. And never does a call remain unheard, misunderstood, or\nleft unanswered in the language in which the call itself was made. And you will\nunderstand it was THIS call that everyone and everything within the world has\nALWAYS made. But YOU had not perceived it as it was. And now you see YOU were\nmistaken. You had been deceived by forms the call was hidden in. And so you did\nnot hear it, and had lost a friend who ALWAYS wanted to be part of you.\n\nThe soft, eternal calling of each part of God's creation to the whole\nis heard throughout the world this second lesson brings. There is no living thing\nwhich does not share the universal will that it be whole, and that you do not\nleave its call unheard. Without your answer is it left to die, as it is saved\nfrom death when you have heard its calling as the ancient call to life, and\nunderstood that it is but your own. The Christ in you remembers God with all the\ncertainty with which He knows His Love. But ONLY if His Son is innocent can He BE\nLove. For God were fear indeed, if he whom He created innocent could be a slave\nto guilt. God's perfect Son remembers his creation. But in guilt he has forgotten\nwhat he really is.\n\nThe fear of God results as surely from the lesson that His Son is\nguilty as God's Love must be remembered when he LEARNS his innocence. For hate\nmust father fear, and look upon its father as itself. How wrong are you who fail\nto hear the call that echoes past each seeming call to death, that sings behind\neach murderous attack, and pleads that love restore the dying world! You do not\nunderstand Who calls to you beyond each form of hate, each call to war. But you\nwill recognize Him as you give Him answer in the language that He calls. He will\nappear when you have answered Him, and you will know in Him that God is Love.\n\nWhat is temptation but a wish to make the wrong decision on what you\nwould learn, and have an outcome which you do not want? It is the RECOGNITION\nthat it is a state of mind UNWANTED that becomes the means whereby the choice is\nreassessed; another outcome seen to be preferred. You are deceived if you believe\nyou want disaster and disunity and pain. Hear not the call for this within\nyourself, but listen, rather, to the deeper call beyond it, that appeals for\npeace and joy. And all the world will GIVE you joy and peace. For as you hear you\nanswer, and behold! - your answer is the proof of what you learned. Its outcome\nis the world you look upon.\n\nLet us be still an instant, and forget all things we ever learned, all\nthoughts we had, and every preconception that we hold of what things mean, and\nwhat their purpose is. Let us remember not our own ideas of what the world is\nfor. We do not know. Let every image held of anyone be loosened from our minds\nand swept away. Be innocent of judgment, unaware of any thoughts of evil or of\ngood that ever crossed your mind of anyone. Now do you know him not. But you ARE\nfree to learn of him, and learn of him anew. Now is he born again to you, and you\nare born again to him, WITHOUT the past that sentenced him to die, and you with\nhim. Now is he free to live, as you are free, because an ancient learning passed\naway, and left a place for truth to be reborn.",

    "content": "The Illusion of an Enemy\n\nAn ancient lesson is not overcome by the OPPOSING of the new and\nold. It is not VANQUISHED that the truth be known, or fought against to LOSE to\ntruth's appeal. There is no battle which must be prepared, no time to be\nexpended, and no plans that need be laid for bringing in the new. There IS an\nancient battle being waged AGAINST the truth, but truth does not respond. Who\nCOULD be hurt in such a war, unless he hurts himself? He HAS no enemy in truth.\nAnd CAN he be assailed by dreams? Let us review again what seems to stand BETWEEN\nyou and the truth of what you are. For there are steps in its relinquishment. The\nfirst is a decision which YOU make. But afterwards, the truth is GIVEN you.\n\nYou would ESTABLISH truth. And by your wish, you set two choices to be\nmade each time you think you must decide on anything. NEITHER is true. Nor ARE\nthey different. Yet must we see them both, before you can look PAST them, to the\nONE Alternative that IS a different choice. But not in dreams you made, that this\nmight be OBSCURED to you. What YOU would choose between is NOT a choice, and\ngives but the ILLUSION it is free, for it will have ONE outcome either way. Thus\nis it really not a choice at all. The leader and the follower emerge as SEPARATE\nroles, each seeming to possess advantages you would not want to lose. So in their\nfusion there appears to be the hope of satisfaction and of peace.\n\nYou see yourself divided into both these roles, forever split between\nthe two. And every friend or enemy becomes a means to help you save yourself from\nthis. Perhaps you call it love. Perhaps you think that it is murder justified at\nlast. You hate the one you gave the leader's role when YOU would have it, and you\nhate as well his NOT assuming it, at times you want to let the follower in you\narise, and give away the role of leadership. And this is what you made your\nbrother FOR, and learned to think that this his purpose IS. Unless he serves it,\nhe has not fulfilled the function that was given him by you. And thus he merits\ndeath, because he has no purpose and no usefullness to you.\n\nAnd what of him? What does he want of YOU? What COULD he want, but\nwhat you want of him? Herein is life as easily as death, for what you choose you\nchoose as well for him. Two calls you make to him, as he to you. Between these\ntwo IS choice, because from them there IS a different outcome. If he be the\nleader or the follower to you, it matters not, for you have chosen death. But if\nhe calls for death or calls for life, for hate or for forgiveness and for help,\nis NOT the same in outcome. Hear the one, and you are separate from him, and are\nlost. But hear the other, and you join with him, and in your answer is salvation\nfound.\n\nThe voice you hear in him is but your own. What does he ask you for?\nAnd listen well. For he is asking what will come to you, because you see an image\nof yourself, and hear your voice requesting what you want. Before you answer,\npause to think of this:\n\nThe answer that I give my brother is\n\nWhat I am asking for. And what I learn\n\nOf him is what I learn about myself.\n\nThen let us wait an instant and be still, forgetting everything we thought we\nheard; remembering how much we do not know. This brother neither leads nor\nfollows us, but walks beside us on the selfsame road. He is like us, as near or\nfar away from what we want as we will let him be.\n\nWe make no gains he does not make with us, and we fall back if he does\nnot advance. Take not his hand in anger but in love, for in his progress do you\ncount your own. And we go separately along the way unless you keep him safely by\nyour side. BECAUSE he is your equal in God's Love will YOU be saved from all\nappearances, and answer to the Christ Who calls to you. Be still and listen.\nThink not ancient thoughts. Forget the dismal lessons that you learned about this\nSon of God who calls to you. Christ calls to all with EQUAL tenderness, seeing no\nleaders and no followers, and hearing but ONE Answer to them all. Because He\nhears one Voice, He cannot hear a DIFFERENT answer from the one He gave when God\nappointed Him His only Son.\n\nBe very still an instant. Come without all thought of what you ever\nlearned before, and put aside all images you made. The old will fall away before\nthe new, without your opposition or intent. There will be no attack upon the\nthings you thought were precious, and in need of care. There will be no assault\nupon your wish to hear a call that never has been made. Nothing will hurt you in\nthis holy place to which you come to listen silently, and learn the truth of what\nyou really want. No more than this will you be asked to learn. But as you hear\nit, you will understand you need but come away WITHOUT the thoughts you did not\nwant, and that were NEVER true.\n\nForgive your brother ALL appearances, which are but ancient lessons\nthat you taught yourself about the sinfullness in you. Hear but his call for\nmercy and release from all the fearful images he holds of what HE is, and of what\nYOU must be. He is afraid to walk with you, and thinks perhaps a bit behind, a\nbit ahead, would be a safer place for him to be. Can YOU make progress if you\nthink the same, advancing only when he would step back, and falling back when he\nwould go ahead? For so do you forget the journey's goal which is but to decide\nto walk WITH him, so neither leads nor follows. Thus it is a way you go together,\nNOT alone. And in THIS choice is learning's outcome changed, for Christ has been\nreborn to BOTH of you.\n\nAn instant spent without your old ideas of who your great Companion is\nand what he SHOULD be asking for, will be enough to let this happen. And you will\nperceive his purpose is the same as yours. He asks for what YOU want, and needs\nthe SAME as you. It takes, perhaps, a different FORM in him, but it is NOT the\nform you answer to. He asks and YOU receive, for you have come with but ONE\npurpose; that you both may learn you love each other with a brother's love. And\nAS a brother, must his Father be the same as yours, as he is like yourself.\nTogether is your joint inheritance remembered and accepted by you both. Alone it\nis denied to both of you.\n\nIs it not clear that while you still insist on leading or on\nfollowing, you think you walk alone, with no-one by your side? This is the road\nto nowhere, for the light cannot be given while you walk alone, and so you cannot\nSEE which way you go. And so there IS confusion, and a sense of endless doubting,\nas you stagger back and forward in the darkness and alone. Yet are these but\nappearances of what the journey is, and how it must be made. For next to you is\nOne Who holds the light before you, so that every step is made in certainty and\nsureness of the road. A blindfold can indeed obscure your sight, but cannot make\nthe way itself grow dark. And He Who travels with you HAS the Light.",

    "content": "The Self-Accused\n\nOnly the self-accused condemn. As you prepare to make a choice that\nwill result in DIFFERENT outcomes, there is first one thing that must be\noverlearned. It must become a habit of response so typical of everything you do,\nthat it becomes your FIRST response to all temptation, and to every situation\nthat occurs. Learn this, and learn it well, for it is here delay of happiness is\nshortened by a span of time you cannot realize. You NEVER hate your brother for\nHIS “sins,” but ONLY for your own. Whatever form his sins appear to take, the\nform obscures the fact that you believe it to be yours, and THEREFORE meriting a\njust attack.\n\nWhy should his sins BE sins, if you did not believe they could not be\nforgiven in you? Why are they real in him, if you did not believe that they are\nYOUR reality? And why do you attack them anywhere except you hate yourself? Are\nYOU a sin? You answer “yes” WHENEVER you attack, for BY attack do you assert that\nyou are guilty, and must give as you deserve. And what CAN you deserve but what\nyou ARE? If you did not believe that you DESERVED attack, it never would occur to\nyou to GIVE attack to anyone at all. Why should you? What would be the gain to\nyou? What could the outcome be that you would WANT? And how COULD murder bring\nyou benefit?\n\nSins are in bodies. They are not perceived in minds. They are not seen\nas purposes, but ACTIONS. Bodies act, and minds do not. And therefore must the\nbody be at fault for what it does. It is not seen to be a passive thing, obeying\nyour commands, and doing nothing of itself at all. If you are sin you ARE a body,\nfor the mind acts not. And purpose must be in the body, NOT the mind. The body\nmust act on its own, and motivate itself. If you are sin, you lock the mind\nWITHIN the body, and you give its purpose to its prison house, which acts INSTEAD\nof it. A jailer does not follow orders, but ENFORCES orders on the prisoner.\n\nYet is the BODY prisoner, and NOT the mind. The body thinks no\nthoughts. It has no power to learn, to pardon, or enslave. It gives no orders\nthat the mind need serve, nor sets conditions that it must obey. It holds in\nprison but the willing mind that would abide in it. It sickens at the bidding\nof the mind that would become its prisoner. And it grows old and dies, because\nthat mind is sick within ITSELF. Learning is all that causes change. And so the\nbody, where no learning CAN occur, could never change unless the mind PREFERRED\nthe body change in its appearances, to suit the purpose given by the mind. For it\nCAN learn, and there is ALL change made.\n\nThe mind that thinks it is a sin has but ONE purpose; that the body be\nthe source of sin, and KEEP it in the prison house it chose, and guards, and\nholds itself at bay, a sleeping prisoner to the snarling dogs of hate and evil,\nsickness and attack; of pain and age, of grief and suffering. Here are the\nthoughts of sacrifice preserved, for here guilt rules, and orders that the world\nbe like itself; a place where nothing can find mercy, or survive the ravages of\nfear except in murder and in death. For here are you made sin, and sin can not\nabide the joyous nor accept the free, for they are enemies which sin must kill.\nIn death is sin preserved, and those who think that they are sin MUST die for\nwhat they are.\n\nLet us be glad that you WILL see what you believe, and that it HAS\nbeen given you to CHANGE what you believe. The body will but follow. It can NEVER\nlead you where you would not be. IT does not guard your sleep, nor interfere with\nyour awakening. Release your body from imprisonment, and you will see no-one as\nprisoner to what you have escaped. You will not WANT to hold in guilt your chosen\nenemies, nor keep in chains to the illusion of a changing love the ones you think\nare friends. The innocent release in gratitude for THEIR release. And what they\nsee upholds their freedom FROM imprisonment and death. Open your mind to change,\nand there will be no ancient penalty exacted from your brother or yourself. For\nGod has said there IS no sacrifice that can be asked; there IS no sacrifice that\ncan be made.",

    "content": "The Real Alternative\n\nThere is a tendency to think the world can offer consolation and\nescape from problems that its purpose is to keep. Why should this be? Because it\nis a place where choice among illusions seems to be the ONLY choice. And YOU are\nin control of outcomes of your choosing. Thus you think, within the narrow band\nfrom birth to death, a little time is given you to use for you alone; a time when\neveryone conflicts with you, but you can choose which road will lead you out of\nconflict, and AWAY from difficulties which concern you not. But they ARE your\nconcern. How, then, can you escape from them by leaving them behind? What MUST go\nwith you, you will take with you whatever road you choose to walk along.\n\nReal choice is no illusion. But the world has none to offer. ALL its\nroads but lead to disappointment, nothingness and death. There IS no choice in\nits alternatives. Seek not ESCAPE from problems here. The world was made that\nproblems could not BE escaped. Be not deceived by all the different names its\nroads are given. They have but one end. And each is but the means to GAIN that\nend, for it is here that all its roads will lead, however differently they seem\nto start; however differently they seem to go. Their end is certain, for there is\nno choice among them. All of them will lead to death. On some you travel gaily\nfor a while, before the bleakness enters. And on some the thorns are felt at\nonce. The choice is not WHAT will the ending be, but WHEN it comes.\n\nThere IS no choice where every end is sure. Perhaps you would prefer\nto try them all, before you REALLY learn they are but one. The roads this world\ncan offer seem to be quite large in number, but the time must come when everyone\nbegins to see how like they are to one another. Men have died on seeing this,\nbecause they saw no way EXCEPT the pathways offered by the world. And, learning\nTHEY led nowhere, lost their hope. And yet this was the time they COULD have\nlearned their greatest lesson. All must reach this point, and go BEYOND it. It\nis true indeed there is no choice at all within the world. But this is NOT the\nlesson in itself. The lesson has a PURPOSE, and in THIS you come to understand\nwhat it is FOR.\n\nWhy would you seek to try another road, another person or another\nplace, when you HAVE learned the way the lesson starts, but do not yet perceive\nwhat it is for? Its purpose is the ANSWER to the search that all must undertake\nwho still believe there is another answer to be found. Learn now, WITHOUT\ndespair, there is no hope of answers in the world. But do not judge the lesson\nwhich is but BEGUN with this. Seek not another signpost in the world which seems\nto point to still another road. No longer look for hope where there is none. Make\nfast your learning NOW, and understand you but waste time unless you go BEYOND\nwhat you have learned to what is yet to learn. For from this lowest point will\nlearning lead to heights of happiness, in which you see the PURPOSE of the lesson\nshining clear, and perfectly within your learning grasp.\n\nWho would be willing to be turned AWAY from all the roadways of the\nworld, UNLESS he understood their real futility? Is it not needful that he should\nBEGIN with this to seek another way instead? For while he sees a choice where\nthere is none, what power of decision can he use? The great RELEASE of power must\nbegin with learning where it really HAS a use. And what decision has power, if it\nbe applied in situations without choice? The learning that the world can offer\nbut ONE choice, no matter what its form may be, is the beginning of acceptance\nthat there is a REAL alternative instead. To fight AGAINST this step is to defeat\nyour purpose here. You did not come to learn to find a road the world does not\ncontain.\n\nThe search for DIFFERENT pathways in the world is but the search for\ndifferent FORMS of truth. And this would KEEP the truth from being reached. Think\nnot that happiness is EVER found by following a road AWAY from it. This makes NO\nsense, and CANNOT be the way. To you who seem to find this course to be too\ndifficult to learn, let me repeat that, to achieve a goal, you must proceed in\nits direction, not AWAY from it. And EVERY road that goes the other way will NOT\nadvance the purpose to be found. If THIS be difficult to understand, then IS this\ncourse impossible to learn. But only then. For otherwise, it is a simple teaching\nin the obvious.\n\nThere IS a choice which you have power to make, when you have seen the\nreal alternatives. UNTIL that point is reached you HAVE no choice, and you can\nbut decide how you would choose the better to deceive yourself again. This course\nattempts to teach no more than that the power of decision cannot lie in choosing\ndifferent forms of what is still the SAME illusion and the SAME mistake. All\nchoices in the world depend on this; - You choose BETWEEN your brother and\nyourself, and you will gain as much as he will lose, and what you lose is what is\ngiven him. How utterly OPPOSED to truth is this, when what the lesson's purpose\nis to teach that what your brother loses YOU have lost, and what he gains is what\nis given YOU.\n\nHe has not left His Thoughts! But you forgot His Presence, and\nremember not His Love. No pathway in the world can lead to Him, nor any worldly\ngoal is one with His. What road in all the world will lead within, when EVERY\nroad was made to separate the journey and the purpose it MUST have, unless it be\nbut futile wandering? All roads that lead AWAY from what you are will lead you to\nconfusion and despair. Yet has He never left His Thoughts to die, without their\nSource forever in themselves. He has not left His Thoughts. He could no more\ndepart from them than they could keep Him out. In unity with Him do they abide,\nand in their Oneness BOTH are kept complete.\n\nThere IS no road that leads away from Him. A journey FROM yourself\ndoes not exist. How foolish and insane it is to think that there COULD be a road\nwith such an aim. Where could it go? And how could you be made to travel on it,\nwalking there without your own Reality at one with you? Forgive yourself your\nmadness, and forget all senseless journeys and all goal-less aims. They have no\nmeaning. You can NOT escape from what you are. For God IS merciful, and did not\nlet HIS Son abandon Him. For what He is be thankful, for in that is YOUR escape\nfrom madness and from death. Nowhere but where He is can YOU be found. There IS\nno path that does not lead to Him.",

    "content": "Self-Concept versus Self\n\nThe learning of the world is built upon a concept of the self adjusted\nto the world's reality. It fits it well. For this an image is that suits a world\nof shadows and illusions. Here it walks at home, where what it sees is one with\nit. The building of a concept of the self is what the learning of the world is\nFOR. This is its purpose; that you come WITHOUT a self, and MAKE one as you go\nalong. And by the time you reach “maturity,” you have perfected it to meet the\nworld on equal terms, at one with its demands. A concept of the self is made by\nYOU. It bears NO likeness to yourself at all. It is an idol, made to take the\nplace of your reality as Son of God.\n\nThe concept of the self the world would teach is not the thing that it\nappears to be. For it is made to serve two purposes, but one of which the mind\ncan recognize. The first presents the face of innocence, the aspect acted ON. It\nis this face that smiles and charms and even seems to love. It searches for\ncompanions, and it looks at times with pity on the suffering, and sometimes\noffers solace. It believes that it is good, within an evil world. This aspect can\ngrow angry, for the world is wicked, and unable to provide the love and shelter\ninnocence deserves. And so this face is often wet with tears, at the injustices\nthe world accords to those who would be generous and good.\n\nThis aspect NEVER makes the first attack. But every day a hundred\nlittle things make small assaults upon its innocence, provoking it to irritation,\nand at last to open insult and abuse. The face of innocence the concept of the\nself so proudly wears can tolerate attack in self-defense, for is it not a wellknown\nfact the world deals harshly with defenseless innocence? No-one who makes a\npicture of himself omits this face, for he has need of it. The other side he does\nnot want to see. But it is here the learning of the world has set its sights. For\nit is here the world's reality is set, to see to it the idol lasts.\n\nBeneath the face of innocence there is a lesson that the concept of\nthe self was made to teach. It is a lesson in a terrible displacement, and a fear\nso devastating that the face which smiles above it must forever look away, lest\nit perceive the treachery it hides. The lesson teaches this; “I am the thing you\nmade of me, and as you look on me you stand condemned, because of what I am.” On\nthis conception of the self the world smiles with approval, for it guarantees the\npathways of the world are safely kept, and those who walk on them will not\nescape.\n\nHere is the central lesson that ensures your brother is condemned\neternally. For what YOU are has now become his sin. For this is no forgiveness\npossible. No longer does it matter what he does, for your accusing finger points\nto him, unwavering and deadly in its aim. It points to you as well, but this is\nkept still deeper in the mists below the face of innocence. And in these shrouded\nvaults are all his sins and yours preserved, and kept in darkness, where they\ncannot be perceived as errors, which the light would surely show. You can be\nneither BLAMED for what you are, nor can you CHANGE the things it makes you do.\nAnd you are each the symbol of your sins to one another, silently, and yet with\nceaseless urgency condemning still your brother for the hated thing you are.\n\nConcepts are learned. They are not natural. Apart from learning they\ndo not exist. They are not given, and they must be made. Not one of them is true,\nand many come from feverish imaginations, hot with hatred and distortions born of\nfear. What is a concept, but a thought to which its maker gives a meaning of his\nown? Concepts maintain the world. But they can NOT be used to demonstrate the\nworld is real. For all of them are made WITHIN the world, born in its shadow,\ngrowing in its ways, and finally “maturing” in its thought. They are ideas of\nidols painted with the brushes of the world, which cannot make a single picture\nrepresenting truth.\n\nA concept of the self is meaningless, for no-one here can see what it\nis for, and therefore cannot picture what it IS. Yet is all learning that the\nworld directs begun and ended with the single aim of teaching you this concept of\nyourself, that you will choose to follow this world's laws, and never seek to go\nBEYOND its roads, nor realize the way you see yourself. Now must the Holy Spirit\nfind a way to help you see this concept of the self must be undone, if ANY peace\nof mind is to be given you. Nor can it be unlearned except by lessons aimed to\nteach that you are something else. For otherwise, you would be asked to make\nexchange of what you now believe for total loss of self. And greater terror would\narise in you.\n\nThus are the Holy Spirit's lesson plans arranged in easy steps, that,\nthough there be some lack of ease at times, and some distress, there is no\nshattering of what was learned, but just a re-translation of what seems to be the\nevidence on its behalf. Let us consider, then, what proof there is that you are\nwhat your brother made of you. For even though you do not yet perceive that this\nis what you think, you surely learned by now that you BEHAVE as if it were. Does\nhe REACT for you? And did he know exactly what would happen? Could he see your\nfuture, and ordain before it came what you should do in EVERY circumstance? He\nmust have made the world as well as you, to have such prescience in the things to\ncome.\n\nThat you are what your brother made of you seems most unlikely. Even\nif he did, who gave the face of innocence to you? Is this YOUR contribution? Who\nis, then, the “you” who made it? And who is deceived by all your goodness, and\nattacks it so? Let us forget the concept's foolishness, and merely think of this;\nthere are two parts to what you think yourself to be. If one was generated by\nyour brother, who was there to make the other? And from whom must something be\nkept hidden? If the world be evil, there is still no need to hide what YOU are\nmade of. Who is there to see? And what but is attacked could NEED defense?\n\nPerhaps the reason why this concept must be kept in darkness is that,\nin the light, the one who would not think it true is YOU. And what would happen\nto the world you know, if all its underpinnings were removed? Your concept of the\nworld DEPENDS upon this concept of the self. And BOTH would go, if either one\nwere ever raised to doubt. The Holy Spirit does not seek to throw you into panic.\nSo He merely asks if just a LITTLE question might be raised. There ARE\nalternatives about the thing that you must be. You might, for instance, be the\nthing you chose to have your BROTHER be.\n\nThis shifts the concept of the self from what is wholly passive, and\nat least makes way for active choice, and some acknowledgment that interaction\nmust have entered in. There is some understanding that you chose for BOTH of you,\nand what he represents has meaning that was given it by YOU. It also shows some\nglimmering of sight into perception's law that what you see reflects the state of\nthe PERCEIVER'S mind. Yet who was it that did the choosing first? If you are what\nyou chose your brother be, alternatives were there to choose between, and someone\nmust have first decided on the one to choose, and let the others go.\n\nAlthough this step has gains, it does not yet approach a basic\nquestion. Something must have gone BEFORE these concepts of the self. And\nsomething must have done the learning which gave rise to them. Nor can this be\nexplained by either view. The main advantage of the shifting to the second from\nthe first is that you somehow entered in the choice by YOUR decision. But this\ngain is paid in almost equal loss, for now YOU stand accused of guilt for what\nyour BROTHER is. And you must SHARE his guilt, because you chose it FOR him, in\nthe image of your own. While ONLY he was treacherous before, now must YOU be\ncondemned along with him.\n\nThe concept of the self has always been the great preoccupation of the\nworld. And everyone believes that he must find the answer to the riddle of\nhimself. Salvation can be seen as nothing more than the ESCAPE from concepts. It\ndoes not concern itself with content of the mind, but with the simple statement\nTHAT IT THINKS. And what can think has choice, and CAN be shown that different\nthoughts have different consequence. And it can learn that EVERYTHING it thinks\nreflects the deep confusion that it feels about how it was made, and what it is.\nAnd vaguely does the concept of the self appear to answer what it does not know.\n\nSeek not your Self in symbols. There can be no concept that can stand\nfor what you are. What matters it which concept you accept, while you perceive a\nself which interacts with evil, and reacts to wicked things? Your concept of\nyourself will still remain quite meaningless. And you will not perceive that you\ncan interact but with yourself. To see a guilty world is but the sign your\nlearning has been guided by the world, and you behold it as you see yourself. The\nconcept of the self embraces all you look upon, and NOTHING is outside of this\nperception. If you can be hurt by ANYTHING, you see a picture of your secret\nwishes. Nothing more than this. And in your suffering of ANY kind, you see your\nown concealed desire to kill.\n\nYou will make many concepts of the self as learning goes along. Each\none will show the changes in your own relationships, as your perception of\nyourself is changed. There will be some confusion every time there is a shift,\nbut be you thankful that the learning of the world is loosening its grasp upon\nyour mind. And be you sure and happy in the confidence that it will go at last,\nand leave your mind at peace. The role of the accuser will appear in many places\nand in many forms, and each will seem to be accusing you. But have no fear it\nwill not be undone. The world can teach no images of you unless you WANT to learn\nthem. There will come a time when images have all gone by, and you will see you\nknow not what you are.\n\nIt is to this unsealed and open mind that truth returns, unhindered\nand unbound. Where concepts of the self have been laid by is truth revealed\nexactly as it is. When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and\nbeen recognized as made on NO assumptions that would stand the light, then is the\ntruth left free to enter in its sanctuary clean and free of guilt. There is no\nstatement that the world is more afraid to hear than this:\n\n“I do not know the thing I am, and THEREFORE do not know what I am doing, where\nI am, or how to look upon the world and on myself.”",

    "content": "Recognizing the Spirit\n\nYou see the flesh or recognize the Spirit. There is no compromise\nbetween the two. If one is real the other must be false, for what is real denies\nits opposite. There is no choice in vision but this one. What you decide in this\ndetermines all you see, and think is real, and hold as true. On this one choice\ndoes all your world depend, for here have you established what you are, as flesh\nor Spirit in your own belief. If you choose flesh, you never will escape the body\nas your own reality, for you have chosen that you want it so. But choose the\nSpirit, and all Heaven bends to touch your eyes, and bless your holy sight, that\nyou may see the world of flesh no more, except to heal and comfort and to bless.\n\nSalvation is undoing. If you choose to see the body, you behold a\nworld of separation, unrelated things, and happenings that make no sense at all.\nThis one appears and disappears in death. That one is doomed to suffering and\nloss. And no-one is exactly as he was an instant previous. Nor will he be the\nsame as he is now an instant hence. Who could have trust where so much change is\nseen, for who is worthy if he be but dust? Salvation is undoing of all this. And\nconstancy arises in the sight of those whose eyes salvation has released from\nlooking at the cost of keeping guilt, because they chose to let it go instead.\n\nSalvation does not ask that you behold the Spirit, and perceive the\nbody not. It merely asks that this should be your CHOICE. For YOU can see the\nbody WITHOUT help, but do not understand how to behold a world APART from it. It\nis your world salvation will undo, and LET you see another world your eyes could\nnever find. Be not concerned HOW this could ever be. You do not understand how\nwhat YOU see arose to meet your sight. For if you did, it would be gone. The veil\nof ignorance is drawn across the evil and the good, and must be passed that both\nmay disappear, so that perception finds no hiding place.\n\nHow is this done? It is not done at all. What COULD there be within\nthe universe that God created that must still be done? Only in arrogance could\nyou conceive that YOU must make the way to Heaven plain. The means are GIVEN you\nby which to see the world that will replace the one you made. Your will be done!\nIn Heaven as on earth this is forever true. It matters not where you believe\nyou are, or what you think the truth about yourself must really be. It makes no\ndifference what you look upon, nor what you choose to feel or think or wish. For\nGod Himself hath said, “Thy will be done.\" And it IS done to you accordingly.\n\nYou who believe that you can choose to see the Son of God as you would\nhave him be, forget not that no CONCEPT of yourself will stand against the truth\nof what you are. Undoing truth would be impossible. But concepts are not\ndifficult to change. One vision, clearly seen, that does not fit the picture as\nit was perceived before, will change the world for eyes that learn to see BECAUSE\nTHE CONCEPT OF THE SELF HAS CHANGED. Are YOU invulnerable? Then the world is\nharmless in your sight. Do YOU forgive? Then is the world forgiving, for you have\nforgiven it its trespasses. And so it looks on you with eyes that see as yours.\n\nAre YOU a body? So is all the world perceived as treacherous, and out\nto kill. Are you a Spirit, deathless, and without the promise of corruption and\nthe stain of sin upon you? So the world is seen as stable, fully worthy of your\ntrust; a happy place to rest in for a while, where nothing need be feared but\nonly loved. Who is unwelcome to the kind in heart? And what could hurt the truly\ninnocent? Thy will be done, you holy Child of God. It does not matter if you\nthink you are in earth or Heaven. What your Father wills for you can never\nchange. The truth in you remains as radiant as a star, as pure as light, as\ninnocent as Love Itself. And you ARE worthy that your Will be done.",

    "content": "The Savior's Vision\n\nLearning is change. Salvation does not seek to use a means as yet too\nalien to your thinking to be helpful, nor to make the kinds of change you could\nnot recognize. Concepts are needed while perception lasts. And changing concepts\nIS salvation's task. For it must deal in contrasts, not in truth, which has no\nopposite and cannot change. In this world's concepts are the guilty “bad;” the\n“good” are innocent. And no-one here but holds a concept of himself in which he\ncounts the “good” to pardon him the “bad.” Nor does he trust the “good” in\nanyone, believing that the “bad” must lurk behind.\n\nThis concept emphasizes treachery, and trust becomes impossible. Nor\ncould it change while you perceive the “bad” in you. You could not recognize your\n“evil” thoughts as long as you see value in attack. You WILL perceive them\nsometimes, but will NOT see them as meaningless. And so they come in fearful\nform, with content still concealed, to shake your sorry concept of yourself, and\nblacken it with still another “crime.” YOU cannot give yourself your innocence,\nfor you are too confused about yourself. But should ONE brother dawn upon your\nsight as wholly worthy of forgiveness, then your concept of yourself IS wholly\nchanged.\n\nYOUR “evil” thoughts have been forgiven with his, because you let them\nall effect YOU not. No longer did you choose that you should be the sign of\n“evil” and of guilt in him. And as you gave your trust to what is “good” in him,\nyou gave it to the “good” in you. In terms of concepts, it is thus you see him\nMORE than just a body, for the “good” is NEVER what the body seems to be. The\nactions of the body are perceived as coming from the “baser” part of you, and\nthus of him as well. By focusing upon the “good” in him, the body grows\ndecreasingly persistent in your sight, and will at length be seen as little more\nthan just a shadow circling round the “good.”\n\nAnd this will be your concept of YOURSELF, when you have reached the\nworld beyond the sight your eyes alone can offer you to see. For you will not\ninterpret what you see without the Aid that God has given you. And in His sight\nthere IS another world. You live in that world just as much as this, for BOTH are\nconcepts of yourself, which can be interchanged, but never jointly held. The\ncontrast is far greater than you think, for you will love this concept of\nyourself, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MADE FOR YOU ALONE. Born as a gift for someone NOT\nperceived to be yourself, it has been given YOU. For your forgiveness, offered\nunto him, has been accepted now for BOTH of you.\n\nHave faith in him who walks with you, so that your fearful concept of\nyourself may change. And look upon the “good” in him, that you may not be fearful\nof your “evil” thoughts, because they do not cloud your view of him. And all this\nshift requires is that you be WILLING that this happy change occur. No more than\nthis is asked. On its behalf, remember what the concept of yourself which now you\nhold has brought you in its wake, and welcome the glad contrast offered you. Hold\nout your hand, that you may have the gift of kind forgiveness, which you offer\none whose need for it is just the same as yours. And let your cruel concept of\nyourself be changed to one which brings the peace of God.\n\nThe concept of yourself which now you hold would GUARANTEE your\nfunction here remain forever unaccomplished and undone. And thus it dooms you to\na bitter sense of deep depression and futility. Yet it need not be fixed, unless\nyou choose to hold it past the hope of change, and keep it static and concealed\nwithin your mind. Give it instead to Him Who understands the changes that it\nneeds to let it SERVE the function given you to bring you peace, that you may\noffer peace to have it yours. Alternatives are in your mind to use, and you CAN\nsee yourself another way. Would you not rather look upon yourself as NEEDED for\nsalvation of the world, instead of as salvation's enemy?\n\nThe concept of the self stands like a shield, a silent barricade\nbefore the truth, and hides it from your sight. All things you see are images\nbecause you look on them as through a barrier which dims your sight and warps\nyour vision, so that you behold nothing with clarity. The light is kept from\neverything you see. At most, you glimpse a shadow of what lies beyond. At least\nyou merely look on darkness, and perceive the terrified imaginings that come from\nguilty thoughts and concepts born of fear. And what you see is hell, for fear IS\nhell. All that is given you is for release; the sight, the vision and the inner\nGuide all lead you OUT of hell, with those you love beside you, and the universe\nwith them.\n\nBehold your role within the universe! To every part of true creation\nhas the Lord of Love and Life entrusted ALL salvation from the misery of hell.\nAnd to each one has He allowed the grace to be a Savior to the holy ones\nespecially entrusted to his care. And this he learns when first he looks upon ONE\nbrother as he looks upon himself, and sees the mirror of himself in him. Thus is\nthe CONCEPT of himself laid by, for nothing stands BETWEEN his sight and what he\nlooks upon, to judge what he beholds. And in this single vision does he see the\nFace of Christ, and understands he looks on everyone, as he beholds this One. For\nthere is light where darkness was before, and now the veil is lifted from his\nsight.\n\nThe veil across the Face of Christ, the fear of God and of salvation,\nand the love of guilt and death, - they all are different names for just ONE\nerror; that there is a space between you and your brother, kept apart by an\nillusion of yourself which holds him off from you, and you away from him. The\nsword of judgment is the weapon which you give to the illusion of yourself, that\nit may fight to keep the space that holds your brother off unoccupied by love.\nYet while you hold this sword you MUST perceive the body as YOURSELF, for you are\nbound to separation from the sight of him who holds the mirror to another view of\nwhat HE is, and thus what YOU must be.\n\nWhat is temptation but the WISH to stay in hell and misery? And what\ncould this give rise to BUT an image of yourself that CAN be miserable, and\nremain in hell and torment? Who has learned to see his brother NOT as this HAS\nsaved himself, and thus IS he a savior to the rest. To everyone has God entrusted\nall, because a PARTIAL savior would be one who is but partly saved. The holy ones\nwhom God has given each of you to save are everyone you meet or look upon, not\nknowing who they are; all those you saw an instant and forgot, and those you knew\na long while since, and those you will yet meet, the unremembered and the not yet\nborn. For God has given you His Son to save from every concept that he ever held.\n\nYet while you wish to stay in hell, how COULD you be the savior of the\nSon of God? How would you know his holiness, while you see him apart from yours?\nFor holiness is seen through holy eyes that look upon the innocence within, and\nthus EXPECT to see it everywhere. And so they call it forth in everyone they look\nupon, that he may be what they expect of him. This is the Savior's vision; that\nhe see HIS innocence in all he looks upon, and sees his own salvation everywhere.\nHe holds NO concept of himself between his calm and open eyes and what he sees.\nHe BRINGS the light to what he looks upon, that he may see it as it really is.\n\nWhatever form temptation seems to take, it ALWAYS but reflects a wish\nto be a self that you are not. And FROM that wish a concept rises, teaching you\nyou ARE the thing you wish to be. It will remain your concept of yourself until\nthe wish that fathered it no longer is held dear. And while you cherish it, you\nwill behold your brother in the likeness of the self whose image has the wish\nbegot of YOU. For vision CAN but represent a wish, because it has NO power to\ncreate. Yet it can look with love or look with hate, depending only on the simple\nchoice of whether you would JOIN with what you see, or keep yourself apart and\nseparate.\n\nThe Savior's vision is as innocent of what your brother is as it is\nfree of any judgment made upon yourself. It sees no past in anyone at all. And\nthus it serves a wholly open mind, unclouded by old concepts and prepared to look\non ONLY what the present holds. It cannot judge because it does not know. And\nRECOGNIZING this, it merely asks, “What is the meaning of what I behold?” Then is\nthe Answer given, and the door held open for the Face of Christ to shine upon the\none who asks in innocence to see BEYOND the veil of old ideas and ancient\nconcepts held so long and dear AGAINST the vision of the Christ in you.\n\nBe vigilant against temptation, then, remembering that it is but a\nwish, insane and meaningless, to make yourself a thing which you are not. And\nthink as well upon the thing that you would be instead. It is a thing of madness,\npain, and death; a thing of treachery and black despair, of failing dreams and no\nremaining hope except to die and end the dream of fear. THIS is temptation;\nnothing MORE than this. CAN this be difficult to choose AGAINST? Consider what\ntemptation is, and see the real alternatives you choose between. There ARE but\ntwo. Be not deceived by what appears as many choices. There is hell or Heaven.\nAnd of these you choose but ONE.\n\nLet not the world's light, given unto you, be hidden from the world.\nIt NEEDS the light, for it is dark indeed, and men despair because the Savior's\nvision is withheld, and what they see is death. Their Savior stands, unknowing\nand unknown, beholding them with eyes unopened. And THEY cannot see until he\nlooks on them with seeing eyes, and offers them forgiveness with his own. Can you\nto whom God says, “Release My Son” be tempted NOT to listen, when you learn that\nit is YOU for whom He asks release? And what BUT this is what this course would\nteach? And what BUT this is there for you to learn?",

    "content": "Choose Once Again\n\nTemptation has ONE lesson it would teach, in ALL its forms, WHEREVER\nit occurs. It would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must\ndie, unable to escape its frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel. It\nsets the limits on what he can do; its power is the only strength he has; his\ngrasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. Would you BE this, if Christ appeared to you\nin all His glory, asking you but this, “Choose once again if you would take your\nplace among the Saviors of the world, or would remain in hell, and hold your\nbrothers there.” For He HAS come, and He IS asking this.\n\nHow do you make the choice? How easily is this explained! You always\nchoose between your weakness and the strength of Christ in you. And what you\nchoose is what you think is real. Simply by never using weakness to direct your\nactions, you have given it no power. And the Light of Christ in you is given\ncharge of everything you do. For you have brought your weakness unto Him, and He\nhas given you His strength instead. Trials are but lessons which you failed to\nlearn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can\nmake a better one, and thus escape all pain which what you chose before has\nbrought to you.\n\nIn every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity you face Christ\ncalls to you, and gently says, “My brother, choose again.” He would not leave one\nsource of pain unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth. He would remove\nall misery from you whom God created altars unto joy. He would not leave you\ncomfortless, alone in dreams of hell, but would release your minds from\neverything that hides His Face from you. His holiness is yours because He is the\nONLY power that is real in you. His strength is yours because He is the Self that\nGod created as His ONLY Son. The images you make can not prevail against what God\nHimself would have you be.\n\nBe never fearful of temptation then, but see it as it is; another\nchance to choose again, and let Christ's strength prevail in every circumstance\nand every place you raised an image of yourself before. For what appears to hide\nthe Face of Christ is powerless before His Majesty, and disappears before His\nholy sight. The Saviors of the world, who see like Him, are merely those who\nchose His strength instead of their own weakness, seen APART from Him. They will\nredeem the world, for they are joined to all the power of the Will of God. And\nwhat they will is ONLY what He wills.\n\nLearn, then, the happy habit of response to ALL temptation to perceive\nyourself as weak and miserable with these words:\n\n“I am as God created me. His Son\n\ncan suffer nothing. And I AM His Son.”\n\nThus is Christ's strength INVITED to prevail, replacing all your weakness with\nthe strength that comes from God, and that can NEVER fail. And thus are miracles\nas natural as fear and agony APPEARED to be before the choice for holiness was\nmade. For IN that choice are false distinctions gone, illusory alternatives laid\nby, and nothing left to INTERFERE with truth.\n\nYou ARE as God created you, and so is every living thing you look\nupon, REGARDLESS of the images you see. What you behold as sickness and as pain,\nas weakness and as suffering and loss, is but temptation to perceive YOURSELF\ndefenseless and in hell. Yield NOT to this, and you will see ALL pain in EVERY\nform WHEREVER it occurs but disappear as mists before the sun. A miracle has come\nto heal God's Son, and close the door upon his dreams of weakness, opening the\nway to his salvation and release. Choose once again what you would have him be,\nremembering that every choice you make establishes your own identity as you will\nsee it, and believe it IS.\n\nDeny me not the little gift I ask, when in exchange I lay before your\nfeet the peace of God, and power to bring this peace to everyone who wanders in\nthe world, uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear. For it is given you to JOIN\nwith him, and through the Christ in you unveil his eyes, and let him look upon\nthe Christ in him. My brothers in salvation, do not fail to hear my voice and\nlisten to my words. I ask for nothing but your OWN release. There is no place for\nhell within a world whose loveliness can yet be so intense and so inclusive it is\nbut a step from there to Heaven. To your tired eyes I bring a vision of a\ndifferent world, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the pain and sorrow\nthat you saw before.\n\nBut this a vision is which you must SHARE with everyone you see. For\notherwise you will behold it not. To GIVE this gift is how to make it yours. And\nGod ordained, in loving kindness, that it BE for you. Let us be glad that we can\nwalk the world, and find so many chances to perceive another situation where His\ngift can once again be recognized as ours. And thus will all the vestiges of\nhell, the secret sins and hidden hates be gone, and all the loveliness which they\nconcealed appear like lawns of Heaven to our sight, to lift us high above the\nthorny roads we traveled on before the Christ appeared.389\n\nHear me, my brothers, hear and join with me. God has ordained I\ncannot call in vain. And in His certainty I rest content. For you WILL hear, and\nyou WILL choose again. And in this choice is everyone made free. I thank You,\nFather, for these holy ones who are my brothers as they are Your Sons. My faith\nin them is Yours. I am as sure that they will come to me as You are sure of what\nthey are, and will forever be. They will accept the gift I offer them because\nYou gave it me on their behalf. And as I would but do Your holy Will, so will\nthey choose. And I give thanks for them.\n\nSalvation's song will echo through the world with every choice they\nmake. For we are one in purpose, and the end of hell is near. In joyous welcome\nis my hand outstretched to every brother who would join with me in reaching past\ntemptation, and who looks with fixed determination toward the light that shines\nbeyond in perfect constancy. Give me my own, for they belong to You. And can You\nfail in what is but Your Will? I give You thanks for what my brothers are, and as\neach one elects to join with me, the song of thanks from earth to Heaven grows\nfrom tiny, scattered threads of melody to one inclusive chorus from a world\nredeemed from hell, and giving thanks to You.\n\nAnd now we say “Amen.” For Christ has come to dwell in the abode You\nset for Him before time was, in calm Eternity. The journey closes, ending at the\nplace where it began. No trace of it remains. Not one illusion is accorded faith,\nand not one spot of darkness still remains to hide the Face of Christ from\nanyone. Thy Will is done, complete and perfectly, and all creation recognizes You\nand knows You as the only Source it has. Clear in Your Likeness does the Light\nshine forth from everything that lives and moves in You. For we have reached\nwhere all of us are One, and we ARE home where You would have us be.",
